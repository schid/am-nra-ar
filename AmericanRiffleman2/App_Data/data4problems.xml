      <![CDATA[<strong>Remington Model 51</strong>



Gun: Remington Model 51 .380 ACP pistol with original box, accessories and paperwork

Condition: 98 percent plus (NRA Excellent)

Value: $950-$1,000



The Remington Model 51 was first offered to the public in September 1919 in .380 Remington Autoloading Cartridge (.380 ACP) only, with an original retail price of $36.30. The .32 ACP was added in August 1921 and retailed for $25. Anyone who’s shot a Model 51 will tell you that it is smooth-functioning and reliable, providing good competition at the time for either the Colt 1903 or 1908 Pocket Models. When Remington announced the discontinuance of this pistol on Aug. 18, 1926, approximately 65,000 had been manufactured. Some eagle-eyed Remington collectors will have already noticed the red UMC logo on the box and UMC markings on the grips, indicating this is an early gun, as the company’s name was changed from Remington UMC to Remington Arms Company, Inc., in 1920.



It’s unusual to find guns of this vintage in 98 percent-plus condition, especially with the original box, accessories and paperwork. During this time, many pistol owners used the factory box for storage instead of buying a soft case, which helps explain the box’s wear, especially on the corners and edges. This practice is the opposite of rifle and shotgun owners at the time, who typically threw the boxes away and stored their long guns in cases.



The <em>Blue Book of Gun Values</em> lists the value for the Remington Model 51 in this condition at $700. Add 25 percent for original box, accessories and paperwork. Because of the premiums now being asked for boxed guns, it is important to make sure a gun’s box is original to that gun, not a similar one from the same period, re-labeled or possibly even a modern reproduction that has been aged to make it look authentic. Additionally, another $100 can be added for the .380 ACP chambering. Even though considerably fewer .32 ACP pistols were produced than the .380 ACP, the larger caliber remains more desirable. In contrast, a 10-percent condition Model 51 without a box is a hard sell at $150.

      <![CDATA[<em>Q. I would very much appreciate it if you could identify the origin and purpose of the cartridges shown in these photos. The bullets appear to be wooden, and all of the cases are primed.</em>



A. The wooden-bulleted 8x57 mm Mauser loads you ask about were known as "exercise" cartridges-what we would call blanks. They were made from cases that were substandard or defective for some reason, and they were used for training, testing and ceremonial purposes. The German army named these cartridges Platzpatrone.

There were many different variations, and many different headstamps. There were also several color variations, although most were purple, red or blue. Most World War II-era 8x57 mm cartridges have three-letter manufacturer codes. On these cartridges, "emp" stands for Dynamit Nobel and "eel" represents H. Wissner of Brotterode in Essen.

    <content_encoded><![CDATA[Likely the only lead-free muzzleloading-specific round balls, <a href="http://www.tomboboutdoors.com/" target="_blank">TomBob Outdoors’</a> American-made ITX 10 g/cc balls are constructed from materials with no significant traces of lead; in fact, the balls are made from the same material as ITX shot, which is USFWS approved for use in waterfowl hunting. The projectiles are tougher than lead, and thus penetrate deeper than a comparable ball made from lead, yet provide a close-to-lead trajectory and will not harm barrel steel. Available in .32, .45, .50, .54 and .60 cal., TomBob Outdoors’ ITX muzzleloading round balls are sold in 8- to 30-count packages (depending on caliber) for $12-$17 at <a href="http://www.ballisticproducts.com/" target="_blank">Ballistic Products, Inc</a>.]]></content_encoded>

      <![CDATA[When I was young, my little group of friends would often break into groups during recess to pretend to be our favorite TV and movie heroes and villains to chase each other around the playgrounds pointing our fingers at one another. It was a game, and aside from the occasional scraped knee, no one ever got hurt.



These days, though, it seems as if school administrators are determine to eliminate activities such as this, as well as any reference to firearms on school campuses through Zero Tolerance. There have even been instances where youngsters got into trouble for wearing T-shirts that promote hunting, which is a time-honored tradition for many families in this country, including mine.



The Zero Tolerance of today’s society really concerns me, as I have two young children who will be exposed to firearms as they get older. In fact, I’ve already started training my 3 year old about what to do if she comes across an unsecured firearm, and am looking forward to taking her to the range for the first time. When he is old enough, my 1 year old will take possession of a .22 rifle that was given to him by a friend of mine, and I’ll let him be the first to fire that gun. I’m concerned that one of the kids will mention to friends that he or she went shooting or hunting over the weekend with daddy, resulting in possible suspension or expulsion over the enjoyment of my hobbies.



My children will know how to safely handle firearms and have numerous opportunities to both shoot and hunt throughout their lives, and I don’t believe that we should be ashamed of these activities. But I am unsure how to prevent them from committing the heinous crime of playing cops and robbers with friends. I guess I just never understood how dangerous a finger could be when I was growing up in rural Mississippi, and now have to determine a way to protect my family from the ever-dangerous finger. Does anyone have any ideas?]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Ideas? Sorry but the liberal viewpoint is that all guns are dangerous, even things that look like guns. And since the liberals run the education system you're screwed! Period! It didn't used to be this way but now it is. Let me take you back to a time when sanity prevailed: I had to give a speech for English class and the topic was hobbies. And one of my hobbies was hunting. That morning I walked in the front door of my high school carrying three rifles and headed for my locker. My class mates and the faculty couldn't have cared less. Before my speech I retrieved the three rifles from my locker and walked down the hallway to the classroom. I placed two of the rifles on a table in front of the class and then grabbed the Marlin M336. I worked the lever quickly and emptied the magazine of empty cartridge cases which fell to the floor with a sensuous metallic sound which echoed through the silent classroom. That was my 'attention step' and it scored a smiling approval from the students and the teacher. Can you imagine trying that today? Think SWAT teams and hand-holders to council those poor students that were traumatized. What has changed? Is it that today's people are inherently more dangerous or is it that our government has run amok? Why are liberals more likely to be afraid of guns than the conservatives? They see guns as a threat – we see guns as simply a tool. Nothing to get excited about, just something useful.     ]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Paul, you obviously haven't been to a school playground recently. Children aren't allowed to run around. It makes the children who can't run as fast feel badly when they can't keep up with the fleeter kids. There is no tag, no dodgeball [(]dangerous - hitting children with a ball[)]. Everyone gets an equal chance no matter how bad they are. Which, of course, eliminates any need or urge to try to improve. Why bother? I'll get a trophy just like the kid who can actually hit or catch the ball. Heaven forbid that your kids actually have energy while they are at school. They will be diagnosed by the school psychometrist  [(]the ultimate loser, they couldn't get a doctorate in their field and practice treating patients for money[)] as hyperactive with attention deficit and a recommendation that you drug them up so that they will sit quietly in a drugged stupor in class and then you will wonder why they don't learn anything. Do yourself and your kids a big favor and send them to some church affiliated school. I don't care what religion. They will get a better education and you won't have to endure all the psychobabble that is today's public school dictum.]]></comment_content>

    <title>Gunsmithing Screwdrivers</title>

      <![CDATA[I thought I’d start the ball rolling by addressing one of the most important tools the aspiring home gun tinkerer should acquire: the screwdriver set. Don’t get off on the wrong foot by using the same tools you would to repair the lawnmower or bicycle. There are reasons that gunsmithing screwdrivers are different-and reasons why you should use them on guns. As to the former, gunsmithing screwdrivers are made from alloy tool steel that has been properly heat-treated, and they are hollow-ground. The first characteristic means they won’t deform once torque is applied to a fastener-potentially marring a gun’s finish. The funny thing about heat treatment is that there’s no way of knowing if it’s been properly applied without subjecting the tool to analysis. The answer: Buy your set from a reputable source that will stand behind it. As to hollow-ground blades, they simply fit the screw’s slot better, decreasing the chances that, as torque is applied, the bit will twist out of the slot. The hollow-ground profile makes each side of a flat bit truly parallel to the other at the tip where it counts. Regular screwdrivers have tapered sides that can and will twist out of the slot if given the chance. Especially when it comes to vintage or collectible guns, the last thing you want to do it "booger" a screw. It’s the surest sign of ham-handed gun tinkering.



The best bit set I’ve used, and the one I assign to every new staff member of <em>American Rifleman</em> is the Brownells Magna-Tip set (<a href="http://brownells.com">brownells.com</a>). I prefer the Master Super Set Plus with 58 bits. Not only are the bits properly made of hardened tool steel that is also properly heat-treated, they are made in the United States. They rest in a custom-fitted tray that also contains short and long driver handles, and they are arranged by width in files and by thickness in ranks. Best of all, bits can be replaced on an individual basis. This all comes at a relatively steep cost, of course, but it’s well worth it in the end when each project that you undertake is both more efficiently completed and better-looking as a result.]]>

      <![CDATA[Lawful citizens, regardless of economic challenge, have the right to affordable firearms and accessories. Unfortunately, escalating medical premiums are whittling away at the ability for citizens to protect themselves and their family’s health during a criminal attack, so the gun industry has responded with some special spring savings. Here’s a random sampling of what’s available.



Smith &amp; Wesson is offering up to <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Category4_750001_750051_757803_-1_757797_757797_image" target="_blank">$100 in rebates</a> on certain models, including $30 off any revolver. Come home with a brand new PARA 1911 and you get <a href="http://www.para-usa.com/2013/support/promotion-and-rebates.php" target="_blank">$100 back</a> by mail. Speaking of 1911s, don’t ignore the <a href="http://www.remington.com/pages/news-and-resources/rebates-and-promotions.aspx?sc_lang=en" target="_blank">$75 savings</a> from Remington on some of its R1 models (or you can claim a free <a href="http://www.storm-lake.com/" target="_blank">StormLake</a> 1911 barrel instead). <a href="http://www.dpmsinc.com/DPMS-Promotions_ep_211-1.html" target="_blank">DPMS</a> and <a href="http://www.bushmaster.com/firearms/promotions.asp" target="_blank">Bushmaster</a> are helping buyers with <a href="http://www.americantactical.us/page/stgrebate.html" target="_blank">$50 back</a> on select models as well. Recoup <a href="http://www.americantactical.us/page/stgrebate.html" target="_blank">$50</a> on the American Tactical STG 44 GSG, and if you purchase any new Thompson/Center Venture rifle, you can qualify for a <a href="https://www.tcarms.com/venture-promo" target="_blank">$75 rebate</a>. Remington Model 700 Varmints also have a <a href="http://www.remington.com/pages/news-and-resources/rebates-and-promotions.aspx?sc_lang=en" target="_blank">special deal</a> going.



What’s a new gun without optics? Zeiss is running a <a href="http://sportsoptics.zeiss.com/hunting/en_us/experience/news/springpromotions.html" target="_blank">spring promotion</a> through May 4 with rebates of up to $125. For the fourth year in a row, Nikon is running its <a href="http://www.nikonpromo.com/mount_em_up.php" target="_blank">Mount ‘Em Up</a> promotion through March 31, which provides a free scope mount with the purchase of the company’s M-223, P-223 or P-300 BLK riflescopes. As if that’s not enough, <a href="http://www.nikonpromo.com/long_range_precision.php" target="_blank">purchase select optics</a> from the company by March 12, and you may qualify for up to $200 in rebates.



Ammo you say. Purchases of select Barnes bullets and cartridges are also part of a <a href="https://www.barnesbullets.com/products/special-offers/2013-fall-rebate/" target="_blank">rebate program</a> worth up to $20 until May 31. You can save up to $20 on Hevi-Shot <a href="http://www.hevishot.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=65" target="_blank">turkey loads</a> purchased before June 30. Get up to $14 back with the <a href="http://www.federalpremium.com/news/promotions_rebates.aspx" target="_blank">purchase</a> of Federal Premium Mag-Shok turkey loads.



But wait, there’s more. Sign up today for the <a href="http://www.fnhusaestore.com/" target="_blank">FNH-USA eNewsletter</a> and your name will be entered in a drawing for a box full of goodies. And, Hornady is offering <a href="http://www.hornady.com/promotions/get-loaded-2014" target="_blank">special incentives</a> for the purchase of its reloading gear.



Don’t delay. Keep your primary gun provider and come home with an extra $1,029 in your pocket by taking advantage of these special savings.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Several years ago, I purchased a 16 camera security system which came with a $50.00 rebate.  I filled out the form and sent my original receipt and the bar code cut from the box per the instructions.  Still waiting optimistically for the check but starting to lose faith.  My experience is if it isn't an instant rebate, it isn't worth the time it takes to fill out and mail the forms.  ]]></comment_content>

    <title>Bad News: Some Criminals May Have More Firearms Training Than You</title>

      <![CDATA[<em>This story first appeared in <a href="http://www.secondcalldefense.org/self-defense-news" target="_blank">Self-Defense News</a> at <a href="http://www.secondcalldefense.org/" target="_blank">Second Call Defense</a>. </em>



In a <a href="http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/node/9267" target="_blank">recent article</a> on the Buckeye Firearms Association website, Greg Ellifritz cited some startling findings from a 2006 FBI study on violent criminals.



Titled <a href="http://www.secondcalldefense.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/Violent-Encounters.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Violent Encounters: A Study of Felonious Assaults on Our Nation's Law Enforcement Officers</em></a>, the study looks at the difference between officers and the criminals who assault them.



According to the study, 40 percent of the criminal attackers received formal firearms training, over 80 percent regularly practiced with firearms (averaging 23 practice sessions a year), more than 40 percent had at least one gunfight experience and 25 percent had been involved in more than five gunfights.



If you're like most people, you operate under the popular assumption that bad guys don't have any firearms training and don't practice shooting. It's a comforting thought, because it suggests that as long as you're armed and have a little training, you stand a pretty good chance of surviving a violent attack.



However, the data in this report suggests that may not always be the case.



Here are some other facts presented in the study:

<ul>

	<li>The offenders were exposed to more violence at an earlier age.</li>

	<li>They are more willing and able to use force, including deadly force.</li>

	<li>Most are younger and less educated, but obviously have street smarts from their experiences (especially what they learn in jail from other offenders).</li>

	<li>Gang members in particular learn "violent values" at an early age and these values are regularly reinforced.</li>

	<li>The goal for gang members is to achieve status and respect from their peers, which comes from creating fear through repeated acts of physical violence.</li>

	<li>Their behavior is not constrained by social, legal or ethical considerations.</li>

</ul>

You can <a href="http://www.secondcalldefense.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/Violent-Encounters.pdf" target="_blank">download the study</a> and read it yourself. But here are some things to consider.



It's a mistake to assume that bad guys are untrained. It's true that this study on violent attacks on law enforcement officers may not be representative of all violent offenders. However, it does show that some portion of the most violent people in our society take crime seriously.



Just as you may own or carry a firearm "just in case" you are faced with life-threatening violence, you should apply the same "just in case" thinking to who your attacker might be. They might be someone with more training and more willingness to do harm. They may be someone who has actual gun fighting experience and won't suffer the same level of disorientation as you will when bullets start flying. They may also be faster to escalate to a level of lethal force.



What does this mean for you? It means a physical threat may not be the "make-my-day" scenario you've been seeing in your mind when you train. It could be more violent than you imagine. And your range practice, standing in a lane calmly shooting paper targets, may prove irrelevant when you're being tackled to the ground, slashed at with a knife or shot by a well-armed and willing attacker.



It also means you should seek out training that goes beyond a basic concealed-carry class. Do you practice an average of 23 times a year as does the average subject in this study? Probably not. Frequent and ongoing training could help you improve your chances of survival.



Second Call Defense is not a firearms training organization. We focus on protecting our members legally after they've survived a lethal-force encounter. However, one of the best ways to avoid legal trouble is to be highly trained and fully competent with a firearm. The more training you have, the more confidence you'll have. And the more confidence you have, the more likely you are to avoid unnecessary violent encounters and to respond quickly, appropriately and effectively to violence when it happens.



Whether you encounter a dumb thug who isn't expecting you to fight back or a career criminal with a lot of training and experience may be a matter of luck. But as they say, luck favors the prepared.]]>

    <title>.38 Super +P?</title>

      <![CDATA[<em>Q. I own a Colt Automatic Pistol, serial No. 759XX chambered in .38 Super. The pistol was purchased new in 1949. It was recently appraised, and the appraiser noted that the pistol appeared "as new and unfired." Although I know that a few rounds have been put through it, his appraisal notes are not far off. It does look brand new and has been superbly maintained. Can I safely shoot .38 Super +P in this pistol? If not, who makes ammunition that would be safe for this pistol? I would like to take the pistol out to the range occasionally, but I do not want to damage it because it is apparently very valuable.</em>



<em></em>A. Your pistol is perfectly safe to use with modern .38 Super ammunition. When the industry adopted the use of the +P designation in 1974, it was done to distinguish between cartridges that had two established pressure limits. The .38 Super +P was used to differentiate between it and the .38 Auto or .38 ACP cartridge that is identical in appearance.



In the case of the .38 Super, the +P designation does not mean it is "hotter." In fact, no manufacturer loads a non +P .38 Super, and today’s ammo is not much different from the ammo that
 was available when your pistol was new.



That said, early .38 Super pistols do have some collector value, but you may find that accuracy is not very good, because older pistols headspace on the semi-rim. My suggestion is to shoot it enough to satisfy your curiosity, and then preserve it carefully.

    <title>The Rock River Arms X-Series… And An Opportunity to Win!</title>

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.rockriverarms.com" target="_blank">Rock River Arms</a> is well-known for its dependable line of AR-15 style rifles, and the company was pitching its new X-Series to interested parties at the 143rd Annual Meetings. The series offers four calibers: .223, .308, 6.8mm SPC, and .458 SOCOM. They're available with a black hand guard, pistol grip and buttstock with an RRA beast brake, or with a tan hand guard, pistol grip and buttstock with an RRA Hunter Brake.



The company drummed up even more energy at its booth by challenging Annual Meetings goers to get creative. Rock River will soon be releasing another new rifle (pictured below), and asked fans to help them name it. The winner, as you might imagine, will be compensated accordingly. Have any suggestions?

I turned the corner near the Sportsman Channel booth, edging around a line of fans queued up all the way to the next aisle. Soon I found myself face-to-face with Sportsman Channel's "<a href="http://www.thesportsmanchannel.com/shows/pigman-the-series/">Pig Man</a>," also known as Brian Quaca (pictured above).



"I love being here," he said with the enthusiasm his fans would recognize right away. "What's great about the Meetings is the number of children and how the manufacturers in this community are supporting these kids." When asked what his fans might expect in upcoming episodes, he dropped a tantalizing hint: "Well, I've hunted pigs from a helicopter…but never a paraglider. That would be something to look forward to."



Of course, "Pig Man" isn't the only celebrity fans are excited to meet. The booth will also be hosting <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UncagedwithMattHughes">Matt Hughes</a>, <a href="http://www.thesportsmanchannel.com/shows/maximum-archery/">Andy Ross</a>, Mike Schoby and NRA's own <a href="http://www.nranews.com/cam">Cam Edwards</a>. Says Gavin Harvey, Sportsman Network's CEO, "These people have broad appeal; they're champions of the outdoor lifestyle who help this way of life cross over into the mainstream. That's why we're so excited to introduce Sarah Palin's <a href="http://www.thesportsmanchannel.com/shows/amazing-america/">Amazing America</a>. She's such a powerful, relatable advocate of the shooting, hunting and fishing lifestyle."



If you'd like to meet some celebrities yourself, there's still time-the NRA Annual Meetings &amp; Exhibits will run one more day.
