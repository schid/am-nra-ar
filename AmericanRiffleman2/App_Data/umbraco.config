              <title><![CDATA[SHOOTING THE KIMBALL]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>If ever there was a gun idea that had every chance in the world of going wild, the Kimball pistol was it.  In 1955, the Army was about to drop the War Baby (or M1 carbine) from use and quantities of both guns and the short little .30 caliber cartridge were on the horizon.  The designer knew that Americans loved the idea of feeding your handgun and carbine from the same belt of ammo.  So why not a modern automatic pistol chambered for that round?  The Kimball pistol was a heavy, solid steel pistol with a delayed blowback action.  Beautifully fitted and finished, the Kimball was somewhat reminiscent of the Colt Woodsman with barrel screwed into the receiver and a short slide at the top rear.</p><p>They never made more than 300 guns before they went out of print and the maker shut down.  In a delayed blowback system with a high pressure cartridge, the action must remain closed until the bullet is long gone and pressures drop.  Kimball used a heavy spring (you could hardly rack the slide) since a heavy slide was out of the question.  That didn’t get it done, so he milled a groove around the chamber.  When fired, the cartridge expanded into this groove and stayed in place until rearward inertia literally swaged the expansion out of the case.  This allowed it to move back for extraction and ejection.  The nifty little gun broke itself right and left and some of the breaks were catastrophic.</p><p>When I mentioned to my editor at the time that I had access to one of the guns, he was quick to go for a shooting session.  I was a bit crazier at that point in life, so I set it up.  I fired the gun (about a dozen shots, as I recall) and got chronograph results.  I also got a group on target, which is probably the only recorded evidence of this curious pistol’s accuracy.</p><p>THE REDHAWK .357</p><p>My young friend was a tall and powerfully built man with good athletic ability.  He was well-suited for police work, full of common sense and sympathy for the citizen, but unwilling to tolerate unlawful behavior.  Let’s say he was “firm” in dealing with the inmates while serving his time in the jail division.  Naturally, he was intent on getting out to patrol, where the rubber meets the road.  We became friends and he barraged me with questions about guns and shooting.  At the range one day, we shot several kinds of guns, most of them the various revolvers we were allowed to use.  Inevitably the question came up---which gun do I buy?  As always, I recommended as much gun as he could comfortably carry.  In fast shooting sessions, weight soaks up recoil and you deliver more accurate rapid fire.  A couple of days later, I saw what he had purchased.</p><p>It was a Ruger Redhawk in .357 Magnum with the shorter 5 ½-inch barrel.  When Bill Ruger designed this gun, he wanted a big one for the American Sportsman.  It was the company’s first large frame DA/SA revolver and needed a massive frame and cylinder to take the real magnum cartridges for which it was chambered---.44, .41 and .357 Magnum.  I doubt if Mr. Ruger ever intended this brute to ride in a policeman’s holster.  In .44 Magnum with 5 ½-inch barrel, the gun weighs 49 ounces.  The .357 version has to be heavier, because far less metal is removed to make the barrel and cylinder.  I am betting it was around 53 to 54 ounces.  Now, that’s a heavy gun, but our hero strapped it on every day, when he went to work as a patrolman.  And everybody giggled and pointed fingers at the young cop and his overgrown handgun.</p><p>Damned if it didn’t happen---the proverbial dark night and a long hallway with a man with a gun at the end.  Reason and persuasion failed; the felon brought up his handgun and the deputy his (heavy) service revolver.  He fired a pair that were as fast and accurate as any peace officer ever fired.  Use enough gun.</p><p>UNDERSTANDING THE WHEEL</p><p>This is a subject that I have brought up before.  Readers have always found it interesting, so we’ll take a look and see what today’s automatic-oriented shooters think about understanding the wheel (gun).  I’m sure you have heard the old saying that revolvers always have a so-called “bad” chamber that shoots poorly.  The saying sort of acknowledges the fact that a sixgun really is six guns, or six chamber/barrel combination.  This is true and I have proved it many times.  There are many reasons why and they all seem to come back to some minor misalignment between a given chamber and the revolver barrel.  It is also possible for more than one chamber to be a trifle off.  Finding the bad ones is fairly easy,</p><p>Settle the gun into a Ransom Rest with a good quantity of your favorite load and then mark the six chambers so you can return to them.  Grease pencil works pretty well and is easily removed after the shoot.  Now, systematically shoot a ten-shot group with each chamber---ten rounds through #1, them ten through #2, etc.  Obviously, change the target after each group.  If there is a marked difference in group size, you will have identified the bad one or even two.  You have also singled out the best.  This is useful information, but not in the way you might think.   For precision shooting, as in hunting, you can set the cylinder to fire that good chamber as the first up.  If you hit, you won’t even need the next five.  You are literally using the gun as a single shot.</p><p>But if you are using the revolver as a competition gun in silhouette, PPC and bullseye work, you need to determine the best team of five chambers.  Back in the machine rest, shoot a group of five from five chambers, leaving out #1, then #2, etc.  Again, change targets after each group, but make sure the targets are placed on the backer in the same relative spot.  Now you are shooting to determine which team of five chambers produces the best group.  Don’t be surprised if the best five includes the so-called “bad” chamber.  Also, I once had the best chamber end up on a team of five that was not the best combination.  That chamber shot fine groups, but its shots went away from where the others were shooting.  OK?</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>7/19/2010 </p><p>Simply put, a laser sight enhances any carry gun. But, the down side of a lot of laser sights is finding a convenient way to mount them on handguns. Most require replacing parts. Others hang on a rail, causing problems with holster fit. The new <a href="http://laserlyte.com/Laser_Gun_Sights/Landing_Page/index.html" target="_blank">LaserLyte Rear Sight Laser</a> is a novel approach to that problem. It is integrated into a replacement rear sight for the handgun, allowing the gun to fit into existing holsters and requiring no other modifications. It also puts the laser close to the bore and to the line of sight, which eliminates some of the wandering point of impact problems common to lasers mounted at a greater distance from the bore. </p><p>LaserLyte uses metal injection molding technology (MIM) to make the sight. It has a matte-black oxide finish. Two tubes, one on each side of the sight, measure just longer than 1/4-inch in diameter and contain the laser and power supply. The left tube is 0.90-inches long and houses four No. 377 watch batteries. A push-button switch in the back activates the laser. Push once for a constant beam laser, twice for the pulse mode and three times to turn the unit off. Batteries provide one hour of run time on constant and two hours in pulse mode. A small light-emitting diode (LED) on the back of the laser indicates the laser&rsquo;s mode setting. </p><p>The tube on the right side houses the laser. In order to make it fit in so small an area and still be adjustable, the laser is held in a polymer case by what LaserLyte describes as its patent-pending &ldquo;biasing cone technology.&rdquo; The sight comes unadjusted with the screws backed out, which allows it to be zeroed. Once the adjustments have been set, readjustment requires the screws be backed out, the unit to sit for 30 minutes to allow the polymer to reset, allowing the shooter to adjust the zero again. LaserLyte specifications call for a 10-foot range of adjustment at 100 yards. The center section of the sight is a conventional, non-adjusting rear sight with a bold white outline. </p><p>LaserLyte is shipping rear sights for Glock, Ruger SR-9, S&amp;W M&amp;P, Springfield XD/XDM, and various M1911-style pistols with more models planned in the near future. The sight is easy to install once the old sight is removed: Once pushed left-to-right into the dovetail with the supplied brass punch, a set screw in the center locks it in place. </p><p><strong>Contact:</strong> LaserLyte; (928) 649-3201; <a href="http://www.laserlyte.com" target="_blank">www.laserlyte.com</a>. </p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Accuracy Matters with Les Baer’s Tactical Recon]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>7/16/2010 </p><p>When most shooters hear the name &ldquo;<a href="http://lesbaer.com/" target="_blank">Les Baer,</a>&rdquo; they probably think of custom M1911 pistols and extremely accurate AR-15s. Ironically, Baer started his gunsmithing career building neither Government Models nor AR-style rifles, but bolt-action arms. As an avid handgun silhouette competitor in the 1970s, Baer initially cut his gunsmithing teeth on custom Remington XP-100 handguns, becoming adept at action trueing, rebarreling, chambering and other accurizing techniques. </p><p>Baer later branched out to building bolt-action competition rifles as well as PPC revolvers, and by the late 1980s he was crafting custom M1911 pistols for <a href="http://www.ipsc.org/" target="_blank">IPSC</a> and other practical pistol sports. Then situated in Allentown, Pa., Baer was a business rival of nearby master pistolsmith Austin Behlert, in whose shop I worked in the early 1990s. Although Baer was one of our competitors, we often built guns using his Government Model slides and frames, as they were of superb quality. </p><p>In 1999, Baer began producing <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/ArticlePage.aspx?id=1948&amp;cid=8" target="_blank">AR-15-style rifles</a> based on his own upper and lower receivers, which were CNC-machined from forgings and featured his own cut-rifled barrels. They quickly garnered a reputation not only for superior fit and finish, but also for unusual accuracy. At a time when a one-minute-of-angle (m.o.a.) factory AR was a rarity, Baer guaranteed 1/2-inch five-shot groups with his highest-grade guns. My own experience with his rifles substantiates that claim, and even his button-rifled Police Special easily delivers nickel-size groups. </p><p>In 2010 Baer returned to his bolt-action roots with <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/Video.aspx?vid=2163&amp;cid=23" target="_blank">the introduction of the LBC Tactical Bolt-Action Rifles</a>. Two distinct models are offered: the Tactical Varmint Classic and the Tactical Recon, the latter being the subject of this article. Though differing in stock design and overall weight, both rifles are distinguished by a guarantee of 1/2-inch or better 10-shot groups at 100 yards with match ammunition. </p><p>The result of a year of development and testing, the Tactical Recon is designed to offer unparalleled accuracy in an out-of-the-box rifle for serious precision shooters, including those in law enforcement, federal agencies, security teams, military units and the like. The rifle is based on the Stiller&rsquo;s Precision TAC30 repeater action, and sports a 24-inch barrel, adjustable Bell &amp; Carlson synthetic stock and a five-round single-column magazine. Chamberings include .243 Win., .260 Rem. and .308 Win. Gun length in all calibers is 43 inches, and weight is 11 pounds, 8 ounces (without scope or bipod). In addition to a magazine, operator&rsquo;s manual and Les Baer Custom catalog, each rifle is supplied with a 20-m.o.a. steel Picatinny rail, a Harris bipod and a padded soft case. </p><p>The gun&rsquo;s TAC30 action from <a href="http://www.viperactions.com/" target="_blank">Stiller&rsquo;s Precision</a>&mdash;a name well-respected by benchresters&mdash;is identical in diameter, footprint and stock screw spacing to the Remington Model 700, allowing the Baer barreled action to be installed in any stock designed for the Remington. The TAC30 receiver differs from the Model 700 design, however, in its distinctive ejection port and left-side pivoting bolt release. </p><p>In addition, the TAC30 action is manufactured to exacting tolerances. The receiver, made of 416R stainless steel hardened to 41 HRc, has its bolt hole and lug raceways formed by wire EDM after heat-treatment to ensure straightness. Bolt clearance inside the receiver runs about 0.004-0.006 inches, and all critical areas&mdash;the barrel threads, locking lug seats, receiver face,and bolt face&mdash;are machined square to the axis of the bore and bolt to 0.001 inch or less. </p><p>Though no sights are provided with the Tactical Recon, the receiver is drilled and tapped for scope mounts. Each rifle is factory-equipped with a steel 20-m.o.a. Picatinny rail from Stiller&rsquo;s Precision, mounted by way of stout 8-40 screws. </p><p>The TAC30 bolt is similar to that of the Remington 700 Short Action, measuring 0.700-inches in diameter and featuring eight spiral flutes, a Remington-style bolt shroud and two large locking lugs. Extraction is accomplished not by the signature Remington spring-clip unit, however, but by a large pivoting AR-15/M16-style extractor, and ejection is by way of the familiar spring-powered plunger. A 0.14-inch port in the bolt head vents gas escaping from a pierced primer or separated case. At the rear of the bolt is the single helical cocking cam and a threaded bolt handle that allows the installation of various bolt knobs. A knurled teardrop-shaped knob is standard on the Tactical Recon. </p><p>The rifle features a Timney Remington 700 trigger, a two-lever design that may be adjusted for pull weight from 1&frac12; to 4 pounds, as well as for overtravel and sear engagement. The trigger is set from about 3 pounds to 3 pounds, 8 ounces at the factory, but a lighter pull may be requested. The Timney trigger features a Remington-style two-position safety lever that blocks the trigger and not the sear, allowing the bolt to be worked with the safety engaged. </p><p>Threaded onto the TAC30 receiver is the Tactical Recon&rsquo;s 24-inch 416R stainless-steel barrel, rifled with a single-point cutter in a five-groove, 1:10-inch right-hand twist. The barrel has a medium-heavy contour, measuring 1.25 inches forward of the receiver ring and 0.79 inches at the muzzle. An oversize 0.30-inch-thick recoil lug is clamped between the receiver and barrel, and the muzzle has a recessed 11-degree crown. Both the barrel and action of the Tactical Recon have a wear- and corrosion-resistant Dupont S coating that confers a non-reflective black finish. </p><p>Baer states that the bore dimensions on his cut-rifled tubes are uniform to within 0.0001 inch from end to end. This is on par with the best match barrels available today and goes a long way toward explaining the unusual accuracy of LBC rifles. Like many of today&rsquo;s top barrelmakers, Baer believes cut rifling puts less stress into the barrel than button rifling or hammer forging. </p><p>Both the Tactical Varmint Classic and the Tactical Recon bolt guns are chambered using reamers from Pacific Tool &amp; Gauge. Dave Kiff, PT&amp;G&rsquo;s owner, is widely recognized as an expert in chamber and reamer design and he specially designed the reamers to meet two design objectives. First, of course, the chambers had to be conducive to maximum accuracy. But just as importantly, each chamber had to accept all military and commercial ammunition&mdash;a capability particularly important in the .308 Win./7.62x51 mm NATO model, which may be called upon to fire any of dozens of commercial or military loads. </p><p>The <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/GalleryItem.aspx?cid=22&amp;gid=67&amp;id=418" target="_blank">Bell &amp; Carlson</a> Varmint/Tactical stock that Baer selected for the Tactical Recon is a remarkably solid unit, with an integral aluminum bedding block, a 7 1/2-inch <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/GalleryItem.aspx?cid=22&amp;gid=67&amp;id=420" target="_blank">accessory rail</a> under the fore-end, adjustments for cheekpiece height and length of pull, and a 1/2-inch-thick Pachmayr buttpad that can be adjusted for cant and vertical position. The pistol grip has the vertical configuration preferred by many tactical shooters, and the 23&frasl;8-inch-wide fore-end is square in cross-section with a flat bottom. The underside of the butt is also flattened for riding a rear bag, and features a removable threaded-in sling swivel stud. A second sling swivel stud, attached to an adapter that rides in the fore-end accessory rail, is used to mount the Harris bipod supplied with each rifle. The stock has a slightly crinkly surface finish that is both non-reflective and easy to grip. Black is currently the only stock color offered, although green with black spider-webbing may soon be an option. </p><p>Although the rifle&rsquo;s Bell &amp; Carlson stock has a bedding block, Baer also beds the stock with Brownells&rsquo; Acraglas at the receiver tang and, in the front, under the receiver ring, around the recoil lug and under the barrel for about an inch forward of the lug. Both the aluminum bottom metal and the steel five-round single-column box magazine are from Wyatt&rsquo;s Outdoor Custom Rifles of Medford, Ore. The Wyatt&rsquo;s Outdoor <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/GalleryItem.aspx?cid=22&amp;gid=67&amp;id=419" target="_blank">magazine release</a> is located inside the trigger guard to minimize the likelihood of inadvertent contact with clothing, twigs and so forth.</p></p><p><p>Though the Tactical Recon looks good and features quality components, the bottom line for serious shooters is performance. Baer&rsquo;s accuracy guarantee of 1/2-inch 10-shot groups at 100 yards is extraordinary performance for a factory rifle firing factory ammunition, and better than many custom rifles achieve with handloads. </p><p>I recently tested Les Baer's guarantee at the range with a Tactical Recon in .308 Win. fitted with a Nightforce 5.5-22x56 mm NXS scope with 0.1 milliradian clicks, mounted in Nightforce rings. Baer advised me that the rifle shot just about all match .308 Win. ammunition well, but particularly favored loads with 168- and 175-grain match bullets. Accordingly, I assembled a collection of test ammunition, including Black Hills&rsquo; 175-grain match load, Federal&rsquo;s Gold Medal 168- and 175-grain loads, and the 155-grain TAP FPD, 168-grain TAP FPD and 178-grain HPBT <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/ArticlePage.aspx?id=1981&amp;cid=31" target="_blank">Superformance loads</a> from Hornady. </p><p>I trundled all this ammunition to the range, along with my Sinclair windage tripod rest, Protektor rear bag, Kurzzeit PVM-21 chronograph, Wheeler Engineering tool kit, targets, pen and paper, bottled water, ham sandwich, et cetera. (Those who aspire to be a professional gun writer should understand that a trip to the range can involve about as much equipment as an expedition across the Gobi desert.) </p><p>Range conditions were good&mdash;sunny with temperatures around 72 degrees F, but with a bit of a crosswind. To give the rifle the best opportunity to perform, I removed the Harris bipod and both sling swivel studs and fired from my Sinclair rest and Protektor bag. The flat-bottomed fore-end and buttstock tracked very well on this setup. There was no need to break-in the barrel, as this was done before the gun left Les Baer Custom. Five-shot groups were fired, both to conserve my limited quantity of ammunition, and to mirror the standard test protocol used by <em>American Rifleman</em>. </p><p>How did it shoot? Very well, indeed. Even the worst-performing ammunition yielded sub-m.o.a. groups, and the best&mdash;the 168-grain loads from Federal and Hornady&mdash;produced the accuracy claimed by Baer. Five-shot groups with these two loads averaged &ldquo;in the threes,&rdquo; mathematically equivalent to 1/2-inch 10-shot groups. Next in performance were the Black Hills and Federal 175-grain loads, and the Hornady TAP load with the 155-grain A-MAX bullet, all of which gave groups of around a 1/2 inch&mdash;good accuracy by any standard. Hornady&rsquo;s new Superformance load, with a 178-grain HPBT bullet came in last at around 0.9 of an inch&mdash;which was surprising, as that ammunition has grouped into a 1/2 inch in several other rifles. </p><p>There was a lot to like about the LBC Tactical Recon. The trigger broke cleanly at 3 pounds, and the adjustable, vertical-grip stock got high marks for ergonomics and comfort. Recoil was minimal, thanks to both stock design and the gun&rsquo;s 14-pound, 7 ounce as-tested weight. No malfunctions of any kind were experienced. Firing pin indentations were centered and sufficiently deep, feeding from the magazine was flawless, and ejection was strong and trouble-free. Finally, with the scope and bipod attached, the rifle balanced perfectly just forward of the magazine, allowing the gun to be conveniently held or carried with only one hand. </p><p>But what about the guaranteed 1/2-inch 10-shot group? I had just enough of the Federal 168-grain Gold Medal load to give it a try. Though the wind had picked up, I (or rather, the gun and I) succeeded in putting 10 successive bullets in a ragged hole measuring 0.491 inch, with most of the dispersion being in the horizontal plane. Clearly, sub-1/2-inch 10-shot groups are well within the capabilities of this rifle. I can&rsquo;t really crow too much about my shooting ability, however. Included with this gun was a 1/4-inch group labeled &ldquo;200 yards, 10 shots, Federal Gold Medal 168-grain HPBT.&rdquo; It seems that Les Baer can not only build guns&mdash;he can shoot them as well. </p><p>I can suggest only a couple of small changes in the Tactical Recon: the installation of flush-mounted cups for quick-detachable sling swivels on both sides of the fore-end and buttstock, and the modification of the buttstock to allow easy removal of the adjustable cheekpiece (for cleaning) and reinstallation at the exact same height. Both changes would make the rifle more appealing to professional shooters, and are under consideration by Baer. </p><p>In the burgeoning realm of high-end precision guns, the Les Baer Tactical Recon rifle is about average in terms of price, but is considerably above average in every other respect. In my years with <em>American Rifleman</em>, I don&rsquo;t think I ever tested a factory .308 Win. rifle that grouped better. On the basis of accuracy alone, the Tactical Recon is worth the price of admission. Real-world tactical shooters will additionally appreciate the gun&rsquo;s moderate weight and well-designed stock. </p><p>When I talked with Les Baer a few weeks ago, he mentioned a number of other bolt-gun projects on his plate, including new chamberings in 6.5x.284 Norma, .300 Win. Mag. and .338 Norma Mag.; a .338 Lapua Mag. rifle, a heavy-barrel tactical gun and possibly models for NRA High Power and F-Class competition. If these rifles are crafted as carefully and perform as impressively as the LBC Tactical Recon, Les Baer&rsquo;s bolt rifles will undoubtedly become as dominant as his M1911s and AR-style guns&mdash;and justifiably so. </p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Les Baer Custom, Inc.; (563) 289-2126; <a href="http://www.lesbaer.com" target="_blank">www.lesbaer.com</a> <br /><strong>Caliber:</strong> .243 Win, .260 Rem., .308 Win.

              <title><![CDATA[Model 1898 Mauser]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>Paul Mauser designed many classic firearms, but his Model 1898 is the unquestioned benchmark used to measure any bolt-action rifle. The strength and safety features of the Model 98 action are legendary. Where most contemporary bolt actions employed locking lugs at either the front or rear of the bolt, the Model 98 has a pair of lugs in the front and a third safety lug in the rear. </p><p>Another safety feature of the Model 98 is the large gas shield at the front of the bolt sleeve to protect the firer&rsquo;s eyes from hot gas and brass splinters in the event of a pierced primer or case-head separation. Oblong holes in the bottom of the bolt body serve the same purpose. </p><p>The Mauser Model 98 bolt also contains twin flanges that support the firing pin. Angled surfaces on the firing pin rest on these flanges, limiting its forward movement when the bolt is unlocked. This prevents the firing pin from protruding beyond the boltface where it can accidentally fire a cartridge before the bolt is fully closed. </p><p>The Model 98 found immediate success as a military rifle, and armies around the world employed Model 98s. Total Model 98 production has exceeded 100 million&mdash;so far. Many were manufactured by Mauser or its affiliate DWM, while still more were manufactured under license in numerous other countries. The Model 98 and its derivatives served as first-line military rifles for more than half a century, until eclipsed by semi-automatic and selective-fire arms. </p><p>As these Mausers were withdrawn from military service, many were sold as surplus where they found new life serving sportsmen. Thousands were modified into excellent custom sporters by both gunsmiths and do-it-yourselfers. </p><p>Of course, Mauser manufactured beautiful commercial sporters of its own based on the Model 98 action. Mauser offered these actions in short, standard and magnum lengths, while the receivers were designed around 14 different cartridges from 6.5x54 mm Mauser to .416 Rigby. </p><p>After more than 100 years, the Model 98-based actions remain in production. Whether on the battlefield or in more peaceful pursuits, no firearm of the 20th Century has seen more use. It is testimony to Paul Mauser&rsquo;s genius that despite 100 years of attempts, no manufacturer has developed a more popular, robust or versatile bolt-action rifle. His design set the standard at the end of the 19th Century that will undoubtedly remain well into the future. Paul Mauser created a truly timeless bolt-action rifle that made Oberndorf am Neckar one of the most famous addresses among the world&rsquo;s firearm enthusiasts. </p><p><strong>Disassembly</strong> <br />To take down the Mauser 98 bolt, lift the bolt handle and pull it fully to the rear. Visually inspect the chamber and magazine to ensure that they are empty. Close the bolt and turn the safety catch to its vertical position. </p><p>Open the bolt again and draw it to the rear until it stops. Then pull the front of the bolt stop out as far as it will go, and remove the bolt assembly from the rifle through the rear of the receiver. </p><p>Remove the bolt sleeve and firing pin assembly by depressing the bolt sleeve stop. When pushed in far enough, you will be able to unscrew the firing pin assembly from the bolt body. As you turn it out, depress the stop again to clear the bolt handle. </p><p>The extractor may be removed by rotating it away from the bolt handle as far as it will go, then prying the front end up and out of its groove. Turn the extractor until it rests between the locking lugs; tap the extractor against a hard surface and it should then snap free. Do not remove the extractor collar unless absolutely necessary. </p><p>To disassemble the bolt sleeve, first rest the point of the firing pin against a block of soft wood. Grasp the bolt sleeve and press down hard until it clears the rifle&rsquo;s cocking piece. Turn the cocking piece one-quarter turn and remove. Gradually ease up pressure on the firing pin spring and remove the bolt sleeve, keeping its end pointed away from you. </p><p>Mauser-made sporters usually had a push-button release for the magazine floorplate, while the more common military actions require that you push a cartridge with a jacketed bullet into the catch-hole while simultaneously pushing the floorplate to the rear. Reassembly is in the reverse order.</p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><em>Q. I have received a knife from my father-in-law who was in the Army surplus business after World War II. Among other items he kept was this knife marked “U.S. Army D.D. Sraku &amp; Co.” on the blade and “G 10” on the sheath. The blade is about 12" long, and the handle is about 4½" long. The knife is pretty crude but well put together. The blade was shaped with a file. The writing on the blade looks like the letters were scratched in, then filled with brass and filed off flush. You had a very nice article a year or so ago about U.S. military knives. Perhaps you could tell me something about this knife.</em></p><p><em></em>A. As a member of the Army serving in the Pacific Islands during World War II, I have seen many types of knives similar to the one now in your possession. Many of the soldiers had these knives made by local craftsmen, especially when we entered the Philippines. In addition, when ashore, the sailors were apt to buy anything that would appear to have been in battle. A great number of these-I call them “souvenirs”-were brought back by servicemen at the war’s end.</p><p>I cannot locate any information on the manufacturing company that is on the blade of your knife. This could be of an organization that was not in the United States, or it was put there by the craftsman, and/or company that originally made the knife.</p><p><em>-Harry Hunter</em></p><p>Originally published October, 2006</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Suppose you were given an opportunity (and the means) to bring to fruition the wildcat handgun or rifle cartridge of your dreams. What would the parent case be (if not an original design)? Describe the case. Here are some things to consider: is it for a short-action or long-action rifle; belted or non-belted; rimmed or rimless; a shallow or steep shoulder angle; and minimal or significant taper. Consider how well it'll cycle, too. What caliber? What velocity would you hope to achieve, and what would be its purpose? Does it offer any real advantage over existing cartridges? Lastly, what would you name it (please keep it clean)? Here’s your chance to create your own cartridge and present it to like-minded friends. Be creative and have fun.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Gary Spencer, 36, and his wife stopped at a Wells Fargo Bank around 9 a.m. Spencer waited in the car while his wife went inside the bank to deposit a check. While waiting in the parking lot, Spencer witnessed two men struggling with one another for a red money bag and heard a "zapping sound." The assailant had been waiting in line behind the man with the bag as he withdrew $5,000 from the bank. When leaving the bank, the victim was then attacked with a stun gun. When Spencer realized what was happening, he reached into his wife's purse and pulled out her .380 pistol. Spencer approached the suspect and ordered him to stop. When the suspect saw Spencer's gun, he dropped the stun gun and fled empty-handed. The victim suffered only minor injuries. (<a href="http://www.independenttribune.com"><em>Independent Tribune</em></a>, Concord, N.C., 10/9/13)</p><p>An 83-year-old homeowner was at home alone around 12:30 a.m. when someone in a hooded sweatshirt came to the door. The stranger claimed to need help. When the homeowner tried to call 911, the man kicked out the door's glass and forced his way inside. The resident grabbed his handgun and fired a single shot striking the intruder in the chest. The offender then fled the scene, but was later caught after allegedly robbing another home just a few blocks away.

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><em>Q: The shotshells in the enclosed pictures are marked "TRACER." What can you tell me about these shells? What was their purpose, and when were they made and used?</em></p><p>A: Tracer shotshells were developed for the military as a training aid during WWII for training aerial gunners in both day and night time air-to-air shooting. They were used on military training ranges for the most part and produced by civilian companies for military contracts. The Remington 12-gauge shells in your photo came with a warning on the box that reads, “The tracer capsule in this shell has a much longer range and higher trajectory than the No.8 lead shot. Personnel in ‘trap’ houses or within 600 yards of the muzzle should be suitably protected. Do not store in high humidity or excessive heat.” They are not kidding. And, for civilian ranges, there is a real danger that the tracer elements of these shells would set the woods on fire which could, in turn, create serious problems for your shooting range. While it is tempting to try a few of them, you would be well advised to keep them as curios or relics for their historical interest.</p><p><em>–Angus Laidlaw</em></p><p>Originally published November, 2006</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Throwback Thursday: A Man Size Pistol]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><em>By Hans Roedder</em></p><p>In order not to be misrepresenting things, I want to say right now that this appellation refers to outer dimensions only. In caliber, the gun I am about to describe, is .22 long rifle.</p><p>For some reason known perhaps to the makers, at least to them only, our native target pistols have always been afflicted with grips, fitting a seven-year-old boy to perfection. The proof of this can be seen at any assembly of pistol shooters, when one looks over the diversified attempts at correcting this shortcoming. There are hardly any of these arms that do not boast of either a special grip, more or less home-made, or additions, "back porches," pads, tape, and whatnot.</p><p>On the other hand, pistols of European manufacture, up to very recently did not meet the requirements of the man of the U.S.R.A. Length of barrel, form of lock, shape and pitch of grip, as well as sights made them unfit for our purpose. It must be admitted that a long and heavily barreled pistol with a very sloping handle, the latter compelling an extremely flexed wrist, is capable of very fine work. This applies particularly to the shooting of short series on the finely ringed 35 mm. target. In spite of this, the tendency on the other side of the ocean appears to be toward the plain trigger, comfortably stocked pistol.</p><p>Several splendid arms of this type have been brought out over there in recent years. These <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/pistol.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-33341" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="pistol" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/pistol-300x128.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="128" /></a>were not developed as a sort of compromise from existing arms, but designed from the ground up, for the intended purpose. The best of this class appears illustrated in this article. It is the product of Friedrich Pickert of Mehlis, Germany, and approaches more than any other the ideal form of target weapon. It combines the good points of a moderate weight with a perfect balance, low line of sight, a full, comfortable grip, quick lock, and an accurate barrel. In addition is to be mentioned a sight equipment with several novel features. The front sight, Patridge pattern, is clamped in a longitudinal slot of the raised matted rib. The rear sight is adjustable by clicks, for both elevation and windage. The rear sight blade being divided, allows the notch to be set at any width desired. The trigger pull is also adjustable for any reasonable weight. It will be noticed that the barrel proper is screw into the breech piece, making it easy of replacement, since the extractor and mechanism remain undisturbed.</p><p>The gun is obtainable in two models, the hammer type, with 10-inch barrel and plain trigger, and in the "free" variety. In this latter form the hammer is inclosed, and is cocked by the backward movement of the locking bolt. It has also thumb and index finger rests, as well as a fine set trigger. Both models operate with tip-up barrel, actuated by guard lever. The workmanship is of the best, bluing and checkering being of the prewar class. The whole shows careful design.</p><p>While this was intended primarily as a description of the pistol per se, a few words about its performance would be appropriate. No matter how correct an arm might be in construction, its shooting qualities will form the final basis for its valuation. By this is meant not so much the accuracy of the barrel alone, but in the combination with a form tending to eliminate or modify the disturbing factors.</p><p>Whether the better performance of a comfortably stocked pistol, over one not so <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/22-pistol.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-33342" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="22 pistol" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/22-pistol-300x117.jpg" alt="22 pistol" width="300" height="117" /></a>endowed, in the hands of the same shooter is due to anatomical or psychological influences, is problematical, and may remain so. Every practical shooter has had some experiences, satisfying to himself, on this point. Having a fairly large hand, I have been able, in the past, to do better and more consistent work with a home-made Remington pistol, than with a S.&amp;W., relined with a tube of wonderful precision. Still, machine rest groups made with the latter were just one third the size of those produced by the former. For the same reason I prefer one make of revolver with a nice full grip to one with a deficient handle, although this has it over the first in point of accuracy.</p><p>The barrels of my pistols showed two points of marked difference to our accepted standards of boring and rifling. The bore itself is tighter by several thousandths of an inch, and the twist is rather quick, being less than fifteen inches to the turn. The rifling appears a bit deeper than that in our standard make. According to our lights, the tight bore and quick twist are not adapted to get the best results, but again the eating of the pudding always tells.</p><p>In my tests for accuracy, I employed a modification of Henry Walton Fry's six point rest in lieu of a machine rest. With it on a bed rock foundation, the human factor is almost entirely eliminated. The distance was 50 yards, weather conditions good to excellent. In all, four makes of ammunition were tried, three of which ran very much alike, with Peters Tackhole in the lead. The fourth was a pour fourth indeed. It was bought at a local store and may have been old. In fairness to its makers, and to the gun as well, I refrain from mentioning its illustrious name, nor is it included in the following list. Thirty 10-shot targets were shot, all of which showed a greater height than width, with the exception of one, the poorest by the way, which was broader than high, by an inch and one half. Total, as fired in order, not at one time:</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/testing.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-33337" title="testing" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/testing.jpg" alt="" width="644" height="172" /></a></p><p>In this test, the "free type" pistol was used solely for the fact that the set trigger permits a let-off almost free from jar. I have no doubt but that this performance could be bettered somewhat, if the shooting were done from a solidly constructed machine rest; but even under the handicap of the improvised holder, the results were pleasing.</p><p>Summing up, the makers of this pistol have succeeded in combining more good features in one arm of this class, than we ever saw so assembled. Starting with an accurate barrel, which we take more or less for granted, plus a mechanical make-up, assuring easy of handling and long life, its greatest individual claim to distinction lies in the form, pitch, and size of the grip, and the relationship of the latter part to both the trigger and the line of sight. In these points lie the factors that make a pistol feel right and inspire confidence, which are conducive to good scores.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Michael Bloomberg, the 15th-richest man in the world, has announced that he is going to spend $50 million on a “grassroots” campaign against the National Rifle Association. In politics, that is a huge amount of money-far more than the amount of money the NRA has been able to spend on politics in the last several years. Other billionaires, including Warren Buffett, have announced that they, too, will support Bloomberg’s campaign.</p><p>Back in 2013, Bloomberg invested heavily in lobbyists and television advertising. Despite massively outspending NRA in both categories, he accomplished virtually nothing at the federal level, and much less than he had hoped for at the state level.</p><p>A very sore loser, he now seems intent on payback, with the Constitution caught in the crossfire.</p><p>Bloomberg recently announced that his gun-control organizations, “Mayors Against Illegal Guns” and “Moms Demand Action,” will now be folded into a new anti-gun group-“Everytown for Gun Safety.”</p><p>The new plan is to dump money on field operations to drive voter turnout; use websites and social media to collect a million names of people who say they favor additional gun control; then use the field operations to contact them and turn them out to vote.</p><p>It’s somewhat similar to President Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign, whose margin of victory was provided by enormous spending, first to frighten uninformed people with lies (e.g., by warning that Mitt Romney would take away their birth control pills), then to identify as many such gullible people as possible and finally to contact them relentlessly to get them to vote.</p><p>Women are now Bloomberg’s top targets-especially mothers. The core of his campaign will be to terrify mothers about guns. As Bloomberg spokeswoman Shannon Watts (head of the Bloomberg “Moms” organization) put it, “Moms are afraid our children will be taken away and in the end, I think that’s the emotion that will win the debate.”</p><p>In fact, “Everytown” debuted with a web video in which a young girl finds a gun in a closet and then shoots her brother. The video concludes by announcing, “Scenes like this happen all the time.”</p><p>That’s a lie.</p><p>Bloomberg never tells viewers that the number of fatal gun accidents involving children (ages 0-14) has declined from a high of 581 in 1971, down to 62 in 2010. (Based on data from the federal Centers for Disease Control, and from the National Safety Council.) This was during a time period when the American gun supply increased enormously, from about 117 million in 1971, to about 320 million in 2010.</p><p>Incidentally, part of the reason for the plunge in accidents is NRA’s very own <a href="http://eddieeagle.nra.org/" target="_blank">Eddie Eagle GunSafe®</a> program. Eddie Eagle has taught more than 27 million children that if they see a gun, “Stop! Don’t touch! Leave the area. Tell an adult.” The program has been endorsed by the National Sheriffs’ Association and the U.S. Department of Justice, and is taught by police departments and sheriffs’ offices throughout the United States.</p><p>Having tried to deceive people about gun accidents, Bloomberg’s plan is to tell them to vote for anti-gun candidates because those candidates favor “universal background checks” for all gun sales. But as we saw last year, Bloomberg’s background check plan is not really about background checks; it’s about criminalizing as many gun owners as possible.</p><p>For example, Bloomberg’s “Initiative 594” on the Washington State ballot this November would make it illegal to loan your firearm to a friend while the two of you plink together on your own land or National Forest property. It would also be a crime to give a gun to a ranch hand or farm hand for a few hours for predator control.</p><p>Bloomberg claims to support the Second Amendment, but in the 2008 Heller case, he filed an amicus brief insisting that ordinary Americans have no Second Amendment rights.</p><p>Bloomberg’s extremism has led to dozens of members of his “Mayors” group quitting after they figured out his true agenda. For example, John Tkazyik, Mayor of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., quit because he said that he had realized the Bloomberg group’s aim was “to promote confiscation of guns from law-abiding citizens.”</p><p>Bloomberg believes he knows much better than you about how you should live your life and take care of your family. In fact, according to Bloomberg, anybody who has kids and a gun in the same house is “really dumb.”</p><p>Which is a perfect example of his extreme hypocrisy. Instead of having a gun himself, he is provided with 24/7 protection by his own armed security guards. Now I don’t have an issue with the fact that Bloomberg has armed security. The problem I have is that he thinks his life is worth protecting but ours are not.</p><p>Bloomberg’s holier-than-thou attitude seems to have actually grown as large as his unchecked ego. In announcing the $50 million pledge, he told <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/17/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-discusses-gun-control.html?_r=1" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>, “I am telling you if there is a God, when I get to heaven I’m not stopping to be interviewed. I am heading straight in. I have earned my place in heaven. It’s not even close.”</p><p>Bloomberg actually believes that his efforts to restrict and ban guns, smoking, and food portions and ingredients are what have “earned” him his place in heaven-of course that is only “if” there is a God, he says. I’ve looked, and I can’t find anywhere in scripture that says the way to get into heaven is to deny good people the right to defend themselves from criminal attack.</p><p>Bloomberg also says he is treated like a “rock star” because people in taxicabs sometimes yell out praise to him. While most New Yorkers who don’t like him are probably too busy to say so to his face, he’s really not even universally popular in New York City.</p><p>To get re-elected mayor by a small margin in 2009, he had to spend $175 per vote-$108 million total.</p><p>As for the rest of America, as <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/04/16/why-mike-bloomberg-shouldnt-be-the-face-of-his-new-gun-control-push/" target="_blank">political writer Chris Cillizza observed</a>, “Bloomberg doesn’t fully grasp how he is viewed by many people outside of major cities and the Northeast.” As if he would even take the time to talk to the ordinary citizens of flyover country, if he ever visited there.</p><p>Make no mistake about it, the Bloomberg lobby is not a “grassroots” organization, despite the national media’s false claims that it is (they seem to have lost their dictionaries). “Everytown” is more like AstroTurf-driven from the top down by political consultants, ad men and the like. It’s the 2014 version of the 1999 “Million Mom March,” which was also a top-down invention of the political class, but was presented to the public as genuine grassroots. It’s the exact opposite of the NRA, which has 5 million dues-paying members and tens of millions of additional supporters.</p><p>Meanwhile, the so-called “mainstream” media, which shrieks incessantly about too much money in politics, employs a double standard for Bloomberg, actually praising him for attempting to buy American elections. Sen. Charles Schumer, Bloomberg’s most ardent supporter in Congress, said that Charles and David Koch’s TV ads criticizing Obamacare were “un-American” and should be outlawed. He said that the Kochs had too much influence on politics. Want to guess whether Sen. Schumer will criticize Bloomberg’s attempt to supersize his own power?</p><p>Bloomberg’s lavish spending clarifies the 2014 election. Gun control is not a grassroots movement of “Moms” or of anybody else. It is the prohibition agenda of Michael Bloomberg and his friends being forced on the American people. The candidates who are endorsed by Bloomberg are, by definition, the favorites of the gun-ban lobby. If they advance, then so does gun control.</p><p>Bloomberg has made certain that anti-gun political spending will greatly exceed pro-rights spending in the important upcoming elections. The NRA could recruit 500,000 more members with annual dues of $35 and pour every cent of that $17.5 million into the election, and Bloomberg, Buffett and other billionaires could easily double the amount with their own pocket change.</p><p>But money doesn’t always buy happiness, or elections. When you’re being heavily outspent in an election, the most crucial factor is whether you have enough resources to communicate your message to your potential supporters. The Second Amendment can win in 2014 if NRA has the resources to communicate the truth-and the importance of voting-to the millions of less politically active gun owners who do not belong to NRA.</p><p>This isn’t the first time that the NRA has battled oligarchs. The NRA’s first forays into politics-beyond promoting marksmanship programs-were in the 1920s, when the Northeastern upper-class business establishment began pushing handgun prohibition. The NRA beat the plutocracy then.</p><p>The NRA and gun-rights supporters defeated the big money again just last year during the Colorado state senate recalls, even though Bloomberg and his allies outspent the pro-rights forces by a 7-1 margin. Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper then publicly urged Bloomberg to stay away from any future recall campaigns. Hickenlooper observed that Coloradans do not like outsiders, such as Bloomberg, meddling in Colorado affairs. Of course, Coloradans did not treat the NRA like an outsider, and for good reason- in Colorado, NRA has a hundred thousand real, dues-paying members.</p><p>NRA can beat the oligarchs again in 2014-but if, and only if, NRA members get active and prove once again that their grassroots people power can overcome Bloomberg’s money power.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.benelliusa.com/" target="_blank">Benelli's</a> much-heralded Ethos is comprised of some of the company's most successful innovations, both old and new. Naturally, the shotgun is centered around the company's famous Inertia Driven operating system. The carrier has been redesigned, making shells easier to load, and an enlarged bolt release makes for simpler and faster operation. The cartridge drop lever has been likewise changed, making the shotgun easier to handle and operate-even for a shooter in gloves. A newly patented Easy Locking System in the bolt body is designed to ensure that the rotating bold head locks up, and the Ethos' system is designed to cycle even the lightest of shotgun loads-right on down to 7/8 ozs.</p><p>The name, meanwhile, is representative of the craftsmanship that Benelli puts into its firearms. Ethos means "character," and has long been used to describe the guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize a community, nation or ideology. The Benelli brand has long prided itself on credibility, respect, integrity and merit-and the company views its new shotgun as the culmination of its own guiding ethos.</p><p>For more information, check out the video embedded below, hosted by <em>American Rifleman</em> Editor-in-Chief <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blog_list.php?cat_id=44" target="_blank">Mark Keefe</a>, or go to <a href="http://www.benelliusa.com/" target="_blank">BenelliUSA.com</a>.</p><p><strong>Technical Specifications:</strong></p><p><strong>Gauge:</strong> 12, 3" (also 2¾")</p><p><strong>Receiver:</strong> black anodized 7075 aluminum alloy</p><p><strong>Overall Length:</strong> 49½"</p><p><strong>Barrel Length:</strong> 26", 28" (tested), 30"</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 6 lbs., 9 ozs.</p><p><strong>Magazine Capacity:</strong> four</p><p><strong>Trigger:</strong> single-stage, 6-lb., 2-oz. pull</p><p><strong>Stock:</strong> AA-grade European walnut with ComforTech Plus: length of pull, 143⁄8"; drop at comb, 1¼"; drop at heel, 17⁄8"</p><p><strong>Chokes:</strong> interchangeable Crio chokes: cylinder, improved cylinder, modified, improved modified and full</p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> interchangeable fiber-optic front bead, white metal mid-rib bead</p><p><strong>Accessories:</strong> five choke tubes, choke-tube wrench, fitted plastic hard case, oil bottle, shim kit for changing cast and drop and magazine plug (other buttpads and comb inserts available at extra cost)</p><p><strong>MSRP:</strong> $1,999 (tested); $2,199 (engraved nickel-plated receiver)</p><p><strong>For Further Reading:</strong></p><p>• <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=29583&amp;cat=13&amp;sub=14" target="_blank">Poetry in Motion: Benelli's Ethos</a></p><p>• <a href="http://www.americanhunter.org/article.php?id=29284&amp;cat=12&amp;sub=20" target="_blank">Hardware: The Benelli Ethos</a></p><p>• <a href="http://www.americanhunter.org/video.php?id=29059&amp;p=1" target="_blank">Waterfowl Hunting with Benelli's Ethos</a></p><p><strong>Multimedia:</strong></p><p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/vNuFf7SijQ0?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>]]></bodyContent>

Along the way he shares photographs of rare prototypes and factory processes, the latter as they occur today at Ruger’s Pine Tree investment casting operation where the guns’ frames and other components are poured into shape from molten metal. Useful asides, such as the single-action grip frame comparison table and background on cartridge standouts-the .357 Maximum, .44 Rem.

The book’s 254-pp., 8½"x11" hardbound format includes generous use of color photography, making it a welcome addition to the coffee table or to the bookshelf of anyone who appreciates either revolvers in general or the unique approach to their manufacture by one of the firearm industry’s giants.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $24.</p><p><strong>Contact:</strong> F+W Media, Inc., Krause Publications, 700 E.

              <title><![CDATA[The Guns of 1864]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>By mid-July 1864, after two and a half months of desperate fighting, the Confederate Army of Tennessee had been pushed from northern Georgia to the outskirts of Atlanta by Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman’s Union forces. In a risky attempt to break the developing siege of the city, Confederate Lt. Gen. John B. Hood withdrew men from Atlanta’s defensive lines and launched a series of assaults on Sherman’s enveloping army. Hood’s July 20 attack at Peach Tree Creek failed, but two days later his gambit seemed on the verge of success, as the Rebels broke through Yankee lines and, in the process, killed Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson.</p><p>When victorious Confederates surged into the Federal rear, however, they encountered stiffening resistance from Union units, including the 66th Illinois Infantry, a regiment with a large number of Henry .44-cal. repeating rifles in its ranks. Private Prosper Bowe of the 66th recalled that: “We started our [Henry] sixteen-shooters to work. The first column in front of us nearly all fell at the first two or three volleys.” The “sixteen shooters” helped win the day, driving the Confederates from the field. The Rebel retreat proved timely for the rapid-firing Yankees, however, since they had begun to run out of ammunition. General Hood ultimately failed in his attempt to lift the siege of Atlanta, arguably at least partially due to the “sixteen shooters.” The city was doomed, and with it, the Confederacy.</p><p>On Sept. 19, 1864, at Winchester, Va., Union Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan launched his campaign to drive Confederate Gen. Jubal Early out of the Shenandoah Valley. As Sheridan’s army advanced, Brig. Gen. Cullen A. Battle’s Alabama brigade counterattacked and, exploiting a gap between two corps, precipitated a retreat all along the Sixth Army Corps front. The First New Jersey Brigade’s fighting withdrawal held off the Rebels and then the Jerseymen were relieved by the 37th Massachusetts Infantry, a regiment recently re-armed with seven-shot Spencer repeating rifles, and the Bay State boys let loose a blizzard of bullets, slowing the Confederate advance. This, coupled with confusion caused by the death of Confederate Maj. Gen. Robert Rodes and a flank attack conducted by Brig. Gen. Emory Upton, halted the Rebels. The Massachusetts men, like their Illinois brothers in arms to the west, ran low on ammunition. They took to ground under a heavy fire of Confederate musketry until soldiers from the 2nd Rhode Island Infantry filled their pockets with Spencer .56-56-cal. cartridges and ran the ammunition up to the 37th. The Yankees went on to win the day, and Col. Elisha Hunt Rhodes of the 2nd was so impressed that he carried a Spencer carbine as his personal arm for the rest of the war.</p><p>If 1863 was the year of the rifle-musket, when the major armies of North and South were finally completely armed with the standard “modern” infantry arms of the day, 1864 could be called the year of the repeating rifle, as increasing numbers of Spencer and, to a more limited extent, Henry repeaters drew notice in the field. These revolutionary breech-loading arms fired self-contained copper rimfire cartridges, with primer, powder and bullet all in one sturdy water-resistant package. The South did not have the industrial capacity to make its own repeaters or ammunition for them, and, although captured Spencers and Henrys began to appear in Rebel ranks as the year wore on, Confederate combat use of captured repeating rifles, unlike rifle-muskets or even Sharps carbines, was dependant on a supply of captured cartridges.</p><p>The heavy fighting on all fronts that brought the repeating rifle to the foreground in the summer of 1864 originated in President Abraham Lincoln’s promotion of Ulysses S. Grant, the victor at Vicksburg and Chattanooga, to lieutenant general and command of all Union ground forces. Leaders of the North and South realized that 1864 would be a crucial year, as the hopes of the Confederacy were largely pinned on a war-weary Union replacing Lincoln with a president amenable to a negotiated settlement. Such an election outcome would likely depend on the success or failure of federal armies in the field.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CWg33ds-Henry-Rifle-overall.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-33197" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="Rifle courtesy of the Emo Phillips collection" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CWg33ds-Henry-Rifle-overall-300x84.jpg" alt="Rifle courtesy of the Emo Phillips collection" width="300" height="84" /></a></p><p>That spring Grant ordered a multi-pronged offensive and personally accompanied Maj. Gen. George G. Meade’s Army of the Potomac in its drive south on Richmond, while his ablest lieutenant, “Uncle Billy” Sherman, marched on Atlanta and smaller armies advanced on other fronts. Grant realized that the Confederate ability to transfer forces from Virginia to Georgia was responsible for Gen. Braxton Bragg’s victory at Chickamauga the previous September, and he hoped to avoid a repetition by applying pressure at as many points as possible.</p><p>In the event, the lesser campaigns did not accomplish much, but the main Union armies were quickly locked in combat with Gen. Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia and Gen. Joseph E. Johnston’s Army of Tennessee. Sherman’s task proved somewhat easier as he had more maneuver room in the west than Grant and Meade did in the east, hemmed in between the Blue Ridge Mountains and the sea in the advance on Richmond.</p><p>The Union armies of 1864, as well as their Confederate opponents, were better armed than they had been since the beginning of the conflict. Almost all of the infantrymen of the opposing Army of Northern Virginia and Army of the Potomac were equipped with rifled arms, mostly in caliber .58 Springfield or .577 Enfield patterns, although an April ordnance report from Battles’ Brigade reveals a number of .54-cal. arms, either Austrian Lorenz imports or older U.S. Model 1841 rifles still in service. There were a few smoothbore muskets in the hands of Union troops, such as the New York regiments of the Irish Brigade and the 12th New Jersey Infantry, but because of preference, not because of a lack of available rifle-muskets.</p><p>Sherman’s infantry was also well-armed with rifle-muskets and shouldered more repeating arms, including government-issued Spencer rifles and privately purchased Henrys, than the Army of the Potomac’s foot soldiers. Although the eastern Confederate infantry had largely re-armed with rifle-muskets by mid-1863, in January 1864 their western counterparts were still shouldering a disproportionate number of smoothbores, despite capturing around 8,000 rifled arms (including 70 Spencers) at Chickamauga. As spring approached, however, the Army of Tennessee was issued enough imported Austrian Lorenz .54-cal. rifles to re-arm a third of its troops, and the vast majority began the campaign with rifled arms.</p><p>More attention appears to have been paid to marksmanship training in the Union army in the spring of 1864 than in previous years, but that instruction continued to be erratic and often lacking in fundamentals. In April, Army of the Potomac Provost Marshal Gen. Marsena Patrick authorized the issue of 10 rounds per man for target practice and ordered all enlisted men to load and fire their arms in the presence of an officer, because “there are men in this army who have been in numerous actions without ever firing their guns, and it is known that muskets taken on the battlefield have been found filled to the muzzle with cartridges.”</p><p>Shooting instruction was, as in the past, largely left to individual unit commanders. In <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/•Moe-Phillips-scoped-musket.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-33200" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="Moe Phillips scoped musket. Rifle courtesy of the Emo Phillips collection." src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/•Moe-Phillips-scoped-musket-300x55.jpg" alt="Moe Phillips scoped musket. Rifle courtesy of the Emo Phillips collection." width="300" height="55" /></a>March and April, 1864, the 121st New York Infantry fired 10 rounds per man at 200 yards and five rounds per man at 300 yards. The 15th New Jersey Infantry had three successive days of target practice, with each man firing a mere three shots at targets set at 300 yards. In the west, Col. Benjamin F. Scribner of the 38th Illinois Infantry instituted a more rigorous regimen. Scribner’s soldiers fired at man-sized targets at ranges of 100, 200, 300, 500 and 1,000 yards, marking hits and measuring distances to determine the accuracy of their sights and the trajectory of their shots.</p><p>Confederate marksmanship training for line infantrymen was spotty as well, with the exception of Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne’s division in the Army of Tennessee. Cleburne, an Irish-born British army veteran, had used British techniques to train his men in basic ballistics and range estimation since 1862. In the fall of 1863, Maj. Calhoun Benham, his chief of staff, produced a manual based on Cleburne’s work and Capt. Henry Heth’s largely ignored pre-war translation of a French shooting handbook. General Bragg ordered it printed and distributed throughout the Army of Tennessee, although there is little evidence that it was implemented extensively.</p><p>It is doubtful that the minimal infantry marksmanship training at longer ranges conducted in the spring of 1864 made any significant difference in the ensuing campaigns. Engagement ranges, although they had lengthened a bit since 1861, were still usually within 200 yards; historian Paddy Griffith computed an average 1864 engagement range as 141 yards. Later in the campaign, soldiers of the 5th New Jersey Infantry considered firing at the enemy at 200 yards “skirmishing and dueling at long range.”</p><p>As 1864 ground on, more repeating arms made their way to Union foot soldiers. The percentage of privately owned Henrys in the 7th, 64th, 66th and 86th Illinois Infantry increased, with guns being delivered to units in the field as Sherman’s army pushed south. When the men of the 5th and 6th Michigan Cavalry traded in their Spencer rifles for Spencer carbines in the fall of 1864, the rifles were re-issued to various Army of the Potomac infantry brigades for sharpshooter use. The state of Massachusetts bought Spencer rifles, which were issued to the 37th Massachusetts Infantry as the regiment passed through Washington in the summer of 1864, and to a sharpshooter company in the 57th Massachusetts Infantry. Some Spencer cavalry carbines were issued to infantry regiments as well, including, in December 1863, the 7th New Hampshire and 7th Connecticut, then serving in the siege of Charleston. In early 1864, however, the New Hampshire regiment turned over half of its carbines to the 40th Massachusetts Mounted Infantry.</p><p>The men of the 7th Connecticut fought well in an ultimately losing cause at Olustee, Fla., in <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CWg118d-Witworth-with-case.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-33201" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="Photo courtesy of historicalimagebank.com" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CWg118d-Witworth-with-case-300x93.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of historicalimagebank.com" width="300" height="93" /></a>February 1864, inflicting heavy casualties on the 64th Georgia Infantry until they were outflanked and their ammunition began to run low. In the end the African-American soldiers of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry saved the day, firing 20,000 rounds from their Enfield muzzleloaders to cover the federal retreat. In May, the Connecticut and New Hampshire regiments, nicknamed the “77th New England,” used their Spencer carbines “to good advantage” at Drewry’s Bluff, Va., although Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler’s tactical ineptitude led to a retreat. Major Oliver Sanford of the Connecticut regiment said of his men that “with the Spencer carbine [and], plenty of ammunition … nothing can stand before them.”</p><p>Sharpshooters could be considered the ultimate Civil War infantrymen, and perhaps the best known such units were Col. Hiram Berdan’s 1st and 2nd U.S. Sharpshooter regiments, armed with Sharps single-shot breechloaders with a few telescopic-sighted target rifles in reserve for use in static situations. Although the U.S. Sharpshooters performed well in 1864, both regiments were mustered out of service as their original enlistments expired in August and the following February. Recruits with service time remaining were transferred to line outfits from their respective states, taking their Sharps rifles with them. Sharps rifles were scattered throughout the army in other units, usually for use in skirmishing.</p><p>Berdan’s regiments were not the only Union units bearing the “Sharpshooter” title. The 66th Illinois, which performed so well at Atlanta, began as “Birge’s Western Sharpshooters,” armed with civilian target rifles. Several companies of Ohio sharpshooters recruited in 1862 were initially issued rifle-muskets, later replaced by Spencer rifles, which like the Henry, were more suited to skirmishing than long-range work. The 1st Michigan Sharpshooters, recruited in 1862 and 1863, did not enter combat until 1864, and were armed with standard rifle-muskets. The 1st suffered heavy casualties in Virginia in 1864 fighting as line infantry, but there is evidence that some Native Americans from the regiment were allowed to camouflage themselves with cut corn stalks and roam the lines seeking targets of opportunity.</p><p>Although effectiveness varied, arguably the best sharpshooter units by 1864 were those in the Army of Northern Virginia, where brigades were authorized to form three to five company sharpshooter battalions. After testing all available arms, those battalions adopted the two-band .577-cal. muzzleloading Enfield rifle, as its five-groove fast rifling twist provided better long-range accuracy, and were issued high quality British-manufactured ammunition. They also received extensive marksmanship training and drill in small unit skirmish tactics, based on Heth’s manual. These sharpshooter battalions had specific tactical assignments whenever their brigades were in action-to aggressively lead in the advance and provide an effective rear guard in withdrawal.</p><p>Each sharpshooter battalion company was issued one or two .451-cal. hexagonal-bored, <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TCWSC7-2nd-MD-Infantry.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-33202" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="“2nd Maryland Infantry, C.S.A., 1864” by Don Troiani; courtesy of historicalartprints.com" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TCWSC7-2nd-MD-Infantry-230x300.jpg" alt="“2nd Maryland Infantry, C.S.A., 1864” by Don Troiani; courtesy of historicalartprints.com" width="230" height="300" /></a>fast-twist Whitworth rifles. The British Whitworths, some of which were equipped with side-mounted Davidson telescopic sights, weighed about the same as rifle-muskets, and were far more portable than the heavy target rifles used by Federal snipers. Perhaps the most famous long-range kill of 1864 was credited to a Whitworth. On May 9, at Spotsylvania, Va., seconds after proclaiming “they couldn’t hit an elephant at this distance,” Union Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick fell to a bullet fired from more than 600 yards away. That Sedgwick was singled out by the shooter is unlikely in the smoke and confusion of the battlefield. He had dismounted to assist an artillery battery in positioning its guns, and the battery itself was the likely target. Still, his death graphically demonstrated the long-range effectiveness of the Whitworth.</p><p>In the west, Confederate sharpshooter units, the best of them in Gen. Cleburne’s Division, were armed with a mix of rifle-muskets, Whitworths and British-made .451-cal. Kerr rifles, as well as some heavy-barreled target rifles converted by the Atlanta arsenal to fire standard rifle-musket ammunition. Perhaps influenced by Cleburne’s interest in long-range shooting, western Confederate sharpshooters seem to have concentrated on sniping more than skirmishing. Kentucky Sharpshooters from the Orphan Brigade were instructed to never approach within 400 yards when engaging federal artillery batteries with their Kerr rifles.</p><p>The impact of repeating firearm technology in 1864 was greatest in the Union mounted arm. Colonel John T. Wilder’s “Lightning Brigade” of mounted infantry and the 5th and 6th Michigan Cavalry were issued Spencer rifles in 1863. That June, Wilder’s men seized Hoover’s Gap, Tenn., dismounted and used their Spencers to hold off a Confederate counterattack. Although the Michigan men had less clear results at Gettysburg, running out of ammunition at the Rummel Farm fight on July 3, both campaigns gained the Spencer an immediate following. After Spencer carbines went into production in October, Union cavalry units re-armed with them as rapidly as they reached the front. By the spring of 1864, demand was so great that the Ordnance Dept. contracted to buy every gun the Spencer factory made to replace the hodge-podge of single-shot carbines of varying quality then in service. Cavalry Bureau Chief Brig. Gen. James H. Wilson reported that “the general desire of the best regiments is to be armed with the Spencer carbine,” and the promise of Spencers was used to encourage re-enlistments.</p><p>The Henry rifle, with production limited to a few hundred guns a month, remained primarily a privately purchased infantry arm with ammunition supplied by the Ordnance Dept. Some Henrys ended up in the hands of horse soldiers, as influential Col. Lafayette Baker convinced the government to outfit his 1st District of Columbia Cavalry with them. Baker’s Henrys, along with some purchased by soldiers in the 23rd Illinois Infantry, were among the few in use in the eastern theater of war, with most “sixteen shooters” found in the ranks of Sherman’s western forces.</p><p>On May 9, 1864, as Grant moved south, the Army of the Potomac’s 10,000-man cavalry corps conducted a massive raid deep into Virginia. At Yellow Tavern, Spencer-armed Michigan troopers combined dismounted firepower with conventional saber charges to drive the Rebels from the field, mortally wounding Confederate cavalry icon Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart in the process. At Haw’s Shop the Michigan men broke a stalemate and again sent the enemy running. Near Cold Harbor, Sharps and Spencer carbines broke a Confederate infantry advance in five minutes of rapid-fire shooting, and at Deep Bottom on July 28, dismounted federal cavalrymen armed with Spencers smashed an attack by four Confederate infantry brigades and pushed them from the field in disorder. In the west, the men of the Lightning Brigade successfully forded a river under fire, ducking beneath the surface to lever another round into their Spencers, and heard a startled Rebel cry out “look at them Yankee sons of bitches, loading their guns under water.”</p><p>Repeating rifles did not guarantee victory, however, and they did fall into enemy hands when the battle went the other way. In a rear guard action at Brice’s Crossroads, Miss., in June, a company of the 2nd New Jersey Cavalry took a wrong turn in the dark and was overrun, losing 50 Spencer carbines to Maj. Gen. Nathan B. Forrest’s men. A Federal cavalry force was outflanked by Rebel infantry at Lovejoy’s Station, Ga., in August and routed by a volley of musketry at 150 yds. followed by a rapid bayonet charge when the Confederates caught the dismounted Yankees reloading their Spencer magazines.</p><p>By November, Forrest had 73 Spencers in his command, and four out of five brigades in Brig. Gen. Wade Hampton’s Confederate cavalry division in Virginia listed some Spencers in their ordnance reports. Virginia cavalrymen captured a number of Henry Rifles from the 1st D.C. Cavalry in a raid near Petersburg, and later used them against Yankees in the Shenandoah Valley. The employment of captured repeaters was, however, as previously noted, necessarily limited by the necessity to use captured ammunition.</p><p>One class of repeating arms that the Confederacy had in abundance, along with plenty of ammunition, however, was handguns, and many Rebel horsemen carried multiple revolvers. Union troops retrieved 36 sixguns from the bodies of six dead Missouri guerillas in late 1864, and when guerilla leader “Bloody Bill” Anderson met his end shortly afterward, he was carrying four revolvers. Multiple handguns were especially useful in the close-range, rapid-fire, hit-and-run mounted tactics favored by guerillas.</p><p>The men of Maj. John S. Mosby’s 43rd Virginia Cavalry Battalion, which conducted numerous successful raids on federal supply lines in the Shenandoah Valley, usually carried four revolvers each. In November 1864, a special Spencer-armed Union unit under Capt. Richard Blazer was created to track down and destroy Mosby’s Rangers, and, after some success, caught up with one of his companies at Kabletown, Va. The Rebels encountered dismounted Spencer fire and feigned retreat before turning and rapidly charging the outnumbered Yankees and delivering a blistering torrent of handgun bullets that wrecked Blazer’s command in short order.</p><p>Unfortunately for the Confederacy, tactical victories like Kabletown were not reflected in the larger war. As 1864 came to a close, and more and more Spencer repeaters were delivered to the Union army, it was evident that Grant’s strategy was the correct one. Atlanta had fallen and Sherman was cutting a 60-mile wide swath of destruction across Georgia on his way to Savannah and the sea with little opposition, while Gen. Hood and the remnants of his army lurched northward on a quixotic invasion of Tennessee that would end disastrously. Sheridan had decisively defeated Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley, once a major source of food for Lee’s army, and was picking it clean. Although the Army of Northern Virginia was still a viable, if severely weakened, force, it remained pinned down in the Petersburg-Richmond siege lines by Grant and Meade. Lincoln’s re-election in November sealed the deal, and a final winter of war began to set in upon the diminishing Southern Confederacy.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Coke Bottle Grips ]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>In the period right after World War II, Smith &amp; Wesson developed a line of modern revolvers. This was in an effort to dominate the market against its main competitor, Colt Firearms. The company was quite successful in that effort, as it came up with a line of new and old calibers with classic features. One such feature was Target grips, seen the first time on K- and N-frame revolvers introduced in the 1950s. The earliest versions were in a shape now referred to as Coke Bottle Grips and abbreviated as “CBGs.” When you think about it for a minute, the name is a good one. Coca-Cola, a legendary carbonated beverage, originally came in a unique bottle. That bottle featured a palm swell in the center and an outward flare at the bottom. It was easy to handle, even when cold and slippery, theoretically making it more desirable. Lots of Coke has been sold and most of it now comes in an aluminum can. Go figure.</p><p>To S&amp;W fans and collectors, it was a black day when the company phased out the CBGs in favor of an easier-to-make, flat-sided Target grip. While the original CBG may have been minimally more effective than its successor, the appearance of the grip was much better. I think much of the appeal of the CBG was the time in which it was made, as well as the way it was finished and fitted to the gun. Those original CBGs were made in a stocking room-a loft, really-at the plant in Springfield. I was lucky enough to visit that room on my first trip to the Roosevelt Street plant in 1988. At that point in time, the CBGs were gone. The originals were made of walnut or rosewood, with a rare South American wood called Goncalo Alves as a later addition. They were nicely checkered and had a distinctive diamond around the screw hole. Long out of production, S&amp;W’s classic Coke Bottle Grips bring seemingly crazy prices on the internet.</p><p>To my considerable pleasure, I have found a source for brand new ones. Ohioan <a href="http://www.kbgrips.com/" target="_blank">Keith Brown</a>, a woodcrafter of great skill now makes new CBGs. They are clearly of better quality than the original factory ones. That’s a strong statement, but a closer look at the provided sample shows superb inletting and exterior shaping, as well as checkering that is flawless. Even the placement of the medallions is perfect. On a nice block of Goncalo Alves, the grips are a fine addition to any N Frame. Brown’s work is not limited to CBGs. His website shows modern renderings of classic customs like Roper and Kearsarge grips. The man is a craftsman of the highest order and deserves our attention.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Weatherby Vanguard Series 2 Back Country ]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Long known-and particularly renowned-for its bolt-action rifles chambered for high-velocity cartridges, <a href="weatherby.com" target="_blank">Weatherby</a> has, since the 1970s, attended to the needs of the budget-conscious shooter with its value-priced Vanguard line. It launched a second series of Vanguard rifles in 2011, and among 2013’s additions to the revamped Vanguard was a lightweight reintroduction of a model for which hunters from mountainous regions clamored: the Back Country.</p><p>Tipping the scales at 6 pounds, 12 ounces, the Vanguard Series 2 Back Country is Weatherby’s answer for hunters who don’t necessarily have wallets as big as the game animals they dream of pursuing. Though it stands out as one of the costlier rifles among the Vanguard line, Weatherby has pitched the Back Country with claims that few companies would stake on a rifle in a “value-priced” line.</p><p>The Back Country, like every rifle in the Vanguard Series 2 line, ships with a guarantee of three-shot sub-m.o.a. accuracy at 100 yards when used with specified Weatherby factory or premium ammunition. Among the other “standard” features that it inherits from its line, the Back Country includes a pillar-bedded stock and a two-stage trigger. As with all Vanguards, it’s built on an action produced for Weatherby by Japan-based Howa. The push-feed design is largely a copy of the discontinued Sako L61R action.</p><p>Among the features that differentiate the Back Country from its Vanguard brethren are its Pachmayr Decelerator recoil pad and Cerakote Tactical Grey finish on all of the rifle’s exposed metalwork. The Pachmayr keeps the lightweight rifle from beating on its operator, and the Cerakote finish provides the additional protection that rugged hunting grounds typically call for. It’s more resistant to corrosion, chemicals and scratches-although scratching the Back Country isn’t impossible. The rifle’s Monte Carlo composite stock features spiderweb accents, giving it a sharp, eye-catching look.</p><p>A Back Country owner that’s dedicated to creating a true light-as-possible configuration <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/W9143_TAR-3012.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-33296" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="Safety" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/W9143_TAR-3012-300x257.jpg" alt="Safety" width="300" height="257" /></a>will find assistance in the form of some of Weatherby’s series-specific accessories. The rifle’s standard hinged floorplate can be swapped out for the company’s Detachable Box Magazine Kit, a Vanguard-specific accessory that supports the .270 Win. and .30-’06 Sprg. variations of the Back Country. The kit replaces the floorplate, spring and trigger guard with a three-round-capacity detachable-box magazine that can shave up to 4 ounces from selected models. The magazine kit is available directly from Weatherby, and lists at less than $100.</p><p>For testing, the Back Country was topped with a Burris 4-16X 44 mm riflescope and settled on a benchrest for stability. The three loads used for evaluation were:  Winchester’s Super-X 150-gr. Power-Point; Hornady’s Superformance 165-grain InterBond; and Barnes’ Vor-TX 180-grain Tipped Triple-Shock X Bullet Boattail (TTSXBT). The most accurate load proved to be that from Barnes, as the average for five consecutive, five-shot groups at 100 yards measured 1.74 inches. The smallest group, which was also produced by Barnes, measured 1.34 inches; however, a single group with Hornady’s Superformance 165-grain InterBond was within 0.10 inches of that size.</p><p>In comparing these groups to Weatherby’s guarantee, one must observe that the company’s accuracy declaration is based on three-shot groups, not five, which is far more demanding of a firearm and marksman. In nearly every group, however, the first three, if not four, bullets impacted close enough to meet the company’s guarantee. Inevitably, the final shot (or two) from the heated barrel went high, outside of the original cluster.</p><p>On top of the range trip, one evaluator was given an opportunity to put the Back Country’s<a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/W9143_TAR-3027.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-33297" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="Weatherby Back Country" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/W9143_TAR-3027-300x228.jpg" alt="Weatherby Back Country" width="300" height="228" /></a> key selling point-its weight-to the test on a five-day elk hunt in the mountains of central Colorado. High altitudes and tougher-than-anticipated terrain made for a series of difficult hikes, providing the rifle with plenty of time to earn its keep. Light on the shoulder and easy to handle when moving through densely wooded hunting property, the Back Country kept grueling treks from becoming anymore unpleasant. During the trip, our reviewer spent one day with a Mark V Accumark (chambered in .300 Wby. Mag.) over his shoulder, and was eager to return to the Back Country the next morning.</p><p>No malfunctions-be they on the range or in the field-were experienced, and the Back Country proved to be comfortable to both carry and operate. The lighter-than-usual nature of the rifle didn’t create a substantial increase in perceived recoil-though by the 75th evaluation round things had grown a bit less pleasant. More standard operation, however, should not be uncomfortable for an operator confident in the caliber of his or her choosing.</p><p>If you’re a rifleman that’s on the go, be it in a mountainous region or on flat terrain, Weatherby’s Back Country makes for an ideal fit. Though the $1,399 price tag makes it one of the Vanguard Series 2 line’s highest priced models, the rifle still checks in at a far more wallet-friendly rate than the custom builds that would be required to replicate its perks and performance. Yes, there are lighter factory-made mountain rifles on the market, but few that might stand up to the Back Country on an out-of-the-box basis.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/W9143_TAR-3041.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-33294" title="Back Country" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/W9143_TAR-3041.jpg" alt="Back Country" width="700" height="183" /></a></p><p><strong><a href="http://weatherby.com" target="_blank">Weatherby</a> Vanguard Series 2 Back Country</strong></p><p><strong>Importer:</strong> Weatherby, Inc., 1605 Commerce Way, Paso Robles, CA 93446; (805) 227-2600</p><p><strong>Caliber:</strong> .240 Wby.

              <title><![CDATA[M1917 Display Bayonet]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><em>Q: I recently bought an M1917 bayonet for display with my Remington M1917 rifle.  My bayonet differs somewhat from the other WWI M1917 bayonets I’ve seen. The only markings are “M1917” and a small “AC” (or “CA”) on the guard.  Is this a real M1917 bayonet and is it correct for my World War I rifle?</em></p><p>A: Your M1917 bayonet was made in the 1960s by Canada Arsenal for use with U.S. military shotguns fitted with bayonet adapters.  As surprising as it may seem, until the late 1960s, the M1917 was the only bayonet standardized for military shotguns.  When the M1917 rifle and bayonet were adopted in 1917, the bayonets were manufactured by Remington and Winchester.  The M1917 bayonet was also used with the 12-gauge “trench guns” during the First World War.  Even though none were made after early 1919, the supply of the WWI-era bayonets was sufficient to meet the demand for almost the next 50 years.</p><p>After the M1917 rifle was withdrawn from service following WWII, the M1917 bayonet remained a standardized item for issue with military shotguns.  By the time of America’s active involvement in Vietnam, the supply of M1917 bayonets was depleted, so contracts for new M1917 bayonets were given to two entities, General Cutlery of Fremont, Ohio, and Canadian Arsenals Limited, Long Branch, Canada.</p><p>The Vietnam-era M1917 bayonets differed in several respects from the WWI bayonets. The blades were not as well made, the guards were pinned to the blade and black plastic grips were used in lieu of the walnut grips found on the earlier bayonets.  The guards were marked with the name of the maker; “GEN CUT” (General Cutlery) or a smaller “A” enclosed in a larger “C” (Canadian Arsenals) along with a “Defense Acceptance Stamp.”  Rather than the green leather scabbards utilized with the WWI bayonets, these bayonets were issued with a composition (plastic) scabbard similar to the type adopted in late WWII.  Your bayonet would not be proper for display with a WWI M1917 rifle since its use was restricted to “trench shotguns” in inventory after the mid-1960s.</p><p><em>–Bruce N.

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>My mother didn’t really have an appreciation for guns. She grew up on a rural farm in Illinois, and the only firearm around the place was a single-shot .22 kept in the barn for varmints. The distance from the house indicates my grandfather didn’t consider it for self-defense.</p><p>My father, on the other hand, came from a family that put meat on the table during The Great Depression by hunting. He brought to the marriage a few firearms, and with a reluctance that bred respect in my brother and I, mom allowed rifles and shotguns in the house. Handguns never gained the same right.</p><p>His collection included a sporterized Enfield, a single-shot, bolt-action 12-gauge, a couple of .22 Long Rifles, including a <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blogs/remington-targetmaster" target="_blank">Remington TargetMaster</a>, and, of course, the no-longer-functional <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blogs/too-valuable-for-the-safe" target="_blank">Stevens 12-gauge</a>. One of his favorites, though, was a Wards Western Field 16-gauge, pump-action shotgun.</p><p>It’s nothing fancy-really a Stevens in Montgomery Ward makeup. The manner in which the solid design changed my mother’s opinion on guns is priceless.</p><p>Dad always told my mother that if a bad guy is breaking into the house and the police are taking forever to arrive, to pump that shotgun once and the perp will run away. It’s really not good advice, especially with today’s all-new generation of <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blogs/break-in" target="_blank">drugged perps</a> on the prowl.</p><p>She always responded with an, “Oh Joe, you worry too much.” He’d shrug, and mark his calendar to deliver the same lecture within a 30-day period. Maybe a year later or so she learned how to work the bolt-release and pump, but refused to load it (she required all firearms to be unloaded in the house, period).</p><p>Everyone was gone except mom, which is how most of these stories start, and someone started to kick in the kitchen door. Naturally, she called 911, but during her wait the door was falling apart.</p><p>In desperation, she grabbed the shotgun, returned to the door, declared her intentions to send the perp’s top half to the next county, pumped and heard footsteps. If he was deaf, high, out of his mind or just mean that night, it wouldn’t have ended as nicely. Mom liked that gun ever since and with Mother’s Day this Sunday I had to break it out and give it a good cleaning. Works like new.</p><p>My mother in law is another story. She loaded her shotgun years ago, and shot the bad guy on the other end of a door in a nearly identical situation.</p><p>I miss both of them dearly. Happy Mother’s Day!</p><p>Thankfully, NRA’s <a href="http://women.nra.org/" target="_blank">Women’s Programs</a> are around today. In fact, signing a loved one up might be the ultimate Mother’s Day gift.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>First off, congratulations to the winner of <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blogs/clounds-on-the-horizon" target="_blank">the inaugural edition of Snapshots</a>, Joe Neuburger. Joe took home first prize with the following submission:</p><p><em>"Joe Biden says if that big shiney thing gets any closer, we're to fire two warning shots, but not to hurt it with our bayonets."</em></p><p>Joe, we'll be in touch. Now, without further ado, we offer you "When Taxidermy Attacks."</p><p>From The pages of <em>American Rifleman’s</em> predecessor, <em>Arms &amp; the Man</em>, Art Director David Labrozzi found this gem. Before Photoshop, it was hard to create dramatic  action photos with wild animals. As evidenced here, it was apparently really hard. The original caption read: “A Chance for Backwoods Surgery.” Good, very good. But we think you can do better.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/taxidermy_attack_i.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33143" title="taxidermy_attack_i" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/taxidermy_attack_i.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="787" /></a></p><p>Keep it clean. Bloomberg probably pays an intern minimum wage to read this blog. Entries will be subjectively judged by staff editors between takes of the TV show, testing guns and making authors seem literate. The winner and others we deem worthy will be printed here. All judgments final. No returns. This week’s special guest judge is Art David Director David Labrozzi, who contributed this week’s no doubt highly sought after prize. No need to hit the box under my desk this week. We offer the snarkiest writer the scarce and desirable NRA “shot” glass. The gun depicted on this object d’art appears to have the back half of a Derringer and two malformed barrels of a LeMat in the front. It’s possible the artisan was drinking when he or she created this. At one time, someone over at the NRA store thought this was a really, really good idea. Object is in fair condition with light staining. No idea what liquid may have been in there at one time, but vestiges of it remain. Object is given away “as is” with original patina. We have no idea of whether it is dishwasher safe or not.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/nra_shot_glass_prize.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33142" title="nra_shot_glass_prize" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/nra_shot_glass_prize.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" /></a></p><p><strong>Official Snapshots Rules:</strong></p><p>• Caption submissions must be made in the comments section of this blog, or on the corresponding Facebook post.</p><p>• One winner will be chosen, selected by Mark Keefe or a randomly selected guest judge.</p><p>• Keep it clean, folks.</p><p><strong>Next Week: Definitely Not Legal For Sale In California, Okay Probably Not</strong></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Having been to a number of firearm manufacturing facilities in which barrels are made, I have had occasion to ask, "What's the best way to clean a barrel?' How frequently should a barrel be cleaned? And what kinds of rods, brushes, jags and patches work best? Answers from manufacturers, custom barrel makers and high-volume shooters were as different as the people who gave them. So, is there a right way or wrong way to clean a barrel? If the former, what are the specific techniques involved? What should you see inside a "good" barrel when using a bore scope? What are your experiences?</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>They may look like your hunting family or mine, but there’s a big difference. Their hunting camp is located in the remote wilderness of Kodiak Island, Alaska, smack in the middle of the densest concentration of earth’s biggest predator, the Kodiak brown bear.</p><p>Beginning next week, the new Discovery Channel series, <em>Kodiak</em> introduces us to the Mays, the Hollands and the Cusacks, three multii-generational hunting families that come together each fall to guide visiting sportsmen to an unmatched bounty of game and fish, but where every venture outside the lodge is a potentially perilous walk on the wild side.</p><p>Like other popular Discovery shows-<em>Gold Rush; Alaska: the Last Frontier; Yukon Men; and Flying Wild Alaska</em>-that highlight the unique freedom and hardships of Alaskan bush life, <em>Kodiak</em> combines behind-the-scenes glimpses with in-your-face action. The daily deprivation and risk give way to the thrills of the hunt and satisfaction of surviving another day, elements that promise to captivate every hunter and viewer with even a little adventure in his or her heart.</p><p>“Alaska has always been surrounded by a veil of mystique, and several of our highest rated shows take place there,” noted Discovery Channel’s Denise Contis. “Now we are excited to introduce our viewers to the legendary forests of Kodiak Island, one of the most isolated and dangerous places on earth.”</p><p>To see for yourself, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjbmneNCNpQ" target="_blank">the YouTube clip</a> embedded below.</p><p>Kodiak is a co-production of Discovery Channels and Orion Entertainment. The four-part series premieres Wednesday, May 14 at 10 p.m. ET/PT.</p><p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/NjbmneNCNpQ" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>The tables were turned when a teen playing "Point 'em Out, Knock 'em Out," a "game" of brutal street violence in which a target is chosen at random and beaten in an attempt to knock them out; a recent crime trend among troubled juveniles. A 17-year-old carrying a stun gun approached his 28-year-old victim, who was waiting for his daughter at her school bus stop. When the assailant turned and pressed the stun gun against his intended victim's side, it failed to discharge. The man responded by pulling out his .40-cal. Smith &amp; Wesson and firing. The teen was later taken to the hospital and treated for a single gunshot wound before facing charges. The intended victim was not harmed during the attack. (<a href="http://www.mlive.com/muskegon"><em>The Muskegon Chronicle</em></a>, Lansing, Mich., 8/28/13)</p><p>A 24-year-old man entered Cobb's Grocery early one morning armed with a knife and a can of mace. He demanded cash from the store clerk, who went to retrieve the money. Meanwhile, another store employee drew his firearm and fired a single shot at the robber. The robber fled the scene in a stolen pickup truck. Police reportedly arrested the man when he was seen driving erratically. He was taken to an area hospital and treated for a gunshot wound before being charged with First Degree Attempted Robbery, Armed Criminal Action, Tampering in the First Degree and Unlawful Use of a Weapon. Store employees reportedly sustained no injuries during the attempted robbery. (<a href="http://dailyjournalonline.com"><em>The Daily Journal</em></a>, Park Hills, Mo., 4/10/14)</p><p><strong>From The Armed Citizen® Archives</p><p></strong><em>March 1932</em>: What was described as an attempted hold-up and assault at a filling station near Erie, Pa., on January 28, was frustrated when the owner, F.L. Burden, seized a gun and held the two robbers at bay until the arrival of state police.<strong></p><p></strong></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[4 Life-Saving Tips for New Shooters]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><a href="httphttp://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=28571&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=26" target="_blank">Personal-defense training</a> and <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13226&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=26" target="_blank">gear</a> has become a big business. There is so much out there in terms of training, guns, ammo and equipment that the new shooter can easily be confused as to what is available and what is really needed. It is almost like wandering around in a maze. At best the process can cost a person a lot of time, money, and frustration. At the worst, it can get that person killed.</p><p>What follows are four easy-to-remember tips that will keep the new shooter headed in the right direction.</p><p><strong>1. Get Professional Training</strong></p><p>Personal protection doesn't begin with buying a defensive handgun, it starts with getting proper training. A professional training school does not teach a person to be a great action-shooting competitor, it teaches the student to fight. Consequently, a professional training school is run, or designed, by people who have actually fought. I know of only a handful of top-notch instructors who have not been in a gunfight and they teach at a school that was designed by a fighter. An instructor with experience truly knows what the student will be faced with in a deadly encounter. He didn't read about it somewhere; he lived it.</p><p>It is also wise to avoid defensive schools that make a big deal about all of their instructors having military background and experience. With all due respect to those who have actually served, the task of the soldier is different from that of the armed citizen. The soldier's task is to go to, or face, the sound of gunfire and he may have to fire numerous rounds to accomplish this task. The armed citizen should be taught to avoid conflict if at all possible and will generally only fire a few rounds when avoidance is not an option.</p><p>Good defensive training schools are expensive, so it important to make sure that money is spent wisely. A good school has a good reputation and is happy to give references. It is also quite specific about all of the costs and requirements involved in signing up for a class. Before committing, the potential student should talk to as many people who have received training at this school as possible. Check it out thoroughly, like it was some guy wanting to marry your daughter.</p><p>I have attended three training schools that I can recommend without reservation. They are the <a href="http://www.gunsite.com/main/" target="_blank">Gunsite Academy</a>, the <a href="https://www.sigsaueracademy.com/" target="_blank">Sig Academy</a> and <a href="http://www.thunderranchinc.com/" target="_blank">Thunder Ranch</a>. They meet all of the criteria that I have previously mentioned and are staffed by excellent teachers who do everything in their power to help the student succeed. Don't go cheap on your training.</p><p><strong>2. Buy the Best Defensive Gear You Can Possibly Afford</strong></p><p>Good defensive handguns and equipment are not cheap. However, the good news is that a good quality handgun will last for generations. The gun that I rely on most is a .45 Colt automatic that is over 40 years old. A good defensive handgun is a lifetime investment, so why not get a good one?</p><p>Remember that I said that getting good training was the place to start in becoming a defensive shooter? One might ask how that is done if you don't already own a suitable defensive handgun. It's quite simple, actually. In the course of signing up for your class, you tell them that you are a new shooter, answer any other questions they might ask and arrange to rent a school gun that the instructor feels is suited to you. While at the school it is a good idea to observe the guns and gear that the instructors are using. Don't be afraid to ask questions and don't be afraid to ask to try other guns that might be available.</p><p>Two common pitfalls in the quest for a defensive handgun are asking policemen and gun-store staff for advice. Sadly, most policemen just don't know much about defensive handguns except for the one that their department says they have to carry. Sales staff, on the other hand, rarely have any actual gunfighting experience and are prone to simply promote whatever guns the boss told them needed to be sold. The same goes for holsters, ammunition and other defensive accessories.</p><p>You are going to be paying good money for that defensive school. You are far better off letting that professional instructor guide you in finding the right defensive handgun, one that will actually suit you and meet your needs.</p><p><strong>3. Internet Gun Forums are a Waste of Time</strong></p><p>Well, that is not exactly true. Internet gun forums can be very entertaining, often better than watching sit-coms on TV. It's just that they are a wasteland when one is seeking good information. New defensive shooters have a ton of questions. And then, after completing a defensive handgun class, they have tons and tons of questions. Reading the blather of some nameless, faceless Internet gun “expert” is not the place to get good answers to those questions.</p><p>Remember that professional defensive school that you spent so much money on? That is the place to go for information and answers. Once you have completed a class at one of these schools, you become a part of its extended family. You will generally come away with your instructor's e-mail address and maybe even his/her phone number. That is the best place to go for answers to your questions about personal defense. Good instructors are happy to be of service and, besides, these contacts will often lead to additional training.</p><p>The exception to contacting your defensive instructor is when you are seeking legal advice. The best source for that information is a local attorney who specializes in criminal defense. Just as a word of caution, the legal advice you can get from the Internet gun forums is worse than their personal-defense advice.</p><p><strong>4. Practice</strong></p><p>The ability to shoot quickly and accurately, as with all other martial arts, is a rapidly diminishing skill. All of the good stuff that you learned at the defensive training school is wasted and lost if you don't practice it fairly regularly. The good news is that your defensive school knows this and will be happy to supply you with practice routines that you can take home and use to keep your skills honed. It is also a good idea to book additional training as often as you can. I try to take at least one class per year and would take more if my budget could afford it.</p><p>There you have it, four tips that will get your personal defense plan started in the right direction from the very beginning. If there were a fifth tip it would be, “Don't Go Cheap.” Wannabe instructors are a waste of good money. Sorry guns are a waste of good money. Ditto for sorry ammo and gear. Good personal-defense training and gear costs money. Only you can decide what your life is worth.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Ruger SR-762]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>A few years back, <a href="http://www.ruger.com" target="_blank">Ruger</a> admitted that it was time to enter the burgeoning AR-style rifle market. Rather than reproducing another gas-impingement platform, the company produced its own AR shooting system, which operated using a patented, chrome-plated, two-stage piston with a multi-stage regulator. That first AR-style rifle, dubbed the SR-556, was chambered in .223 Rem. and was well received by the shooting community. Our latest <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/Blogs-GOTW" target="_blank">Gun of the Week</a>, however, isn’t the SR-556. It’s the next step in the evolution of Ruger’s AR-style platform, chambered in .308-and it’s known as the SR-762.</p><p>The 762 is a re-design of the 556, beefed up to handle the larger  .308 cartridges. That said, the gun looks and feels very similar – in reality, it’s only a little bit more than a half-pound heavier than it’s “little” brother. Its steel components are treated with a non-reflective, black manganese-phosphate finish, while the aluminum components are finished in a matte, hard-coat anodizing to match. Like the 556, it sports a barrel that measures just over 16 inches, and it arrives with a 556-style flash suppressor already in place.</p><p>For more information, check out the video embedded below, hosted by Managing Online Editor Shawn Skipper, or go to <a href="http://www.ruger.com" target="_blank">Ruger.com</a>.</p><p><strong>Technical Specifications:</strong></p><p><strong>Action:</strong> Two-Stage Piston Gas Operated Semi-Auto</p><p><strong>Caliber:</strong> .308 Win./7.62 NATO</p><p><strong>Finish:</strong> Manganese Phosphate/Hard Coat Anodized</p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> Adjustable AR-Type Folding Iron Sights</p><p><strong>Barrel Length:</strong> 16.12”</p><p><strong>Overall Length:</strong> 34.75” to 38”</p><p><strong>Length of Pull:</strong> 11.5” to 14.75”</p><p><strong>Height:</strong> 8”</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 8.6 lbs.</p><p><strong>Twist:</strong> 1:10” RH</p><p><strong>Rifle Grooves:</strong> 6</p><p><strong>MSRP:</strong> $2,195</p><p><strong>For Further Reading:</strong></p><p>• <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=26205&amp;cat=3&amp;sub=6" target="_blank">Review: Ruger SR-762</a></p><p>• <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=25538&amp;cat=3&amp;sub=4" target="_blank">Ruger Introduces the SR-762</a></p><p>• <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blog.php?id=27350&amp;cat=12463" target="_blank">SHOT Show 2014: SR-762 Rifle</a></p><p><strong>Multimedia: </strong></p><p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/apHCTHtpY9o" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Veteran hunter <a href="http://rickyoungoutdoors.com" target="_blank">Rick Young</a> developed his Ultra-Light Bino Harness to reduce the bulk-pack straps, a rifle sling and other gear-that inevitably builds up around a hunter’s neck and upper body, and to eliminate the wind vibration that can accompany “bra”-style harnesses made with flat straps. In addition, the harness adjusts quickly at single point rather than the typical four. Its small-gauge elastic shock cord and unique adjustable lock make it easy to wear in the conventional fashion, as an adjustable neck strap, bandolier style across the chest or side saddle utilizing one shoulder to pull the optic into the hip. The harness easily stretches outward for viewing, which helps stabilize the optic, and quick-release fittings allow it to be removed rapidly.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $20</p><p><strong>Contact</strong>: <a href="http://rickyoungoutdoors.com" target="_blank">Rick Young Outdoors</a>, 11101 S.E. 362nd Ave., Boring, OR 97009; (503) 663-3114</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Justification for Existence: .280 Rem.]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Certainly among the cartridges most deserving of being the subject of “Justification for Existence,” the .280 Rem., I mean 7 mm Rem. Express, never mind, the .280 Rem. could, uniquely, be considered a “niche” <em>and</em> an “all-around” cartridge-all at the same time. For many riflemen, the .280 Rem. offers minimal (if any) appreciable increase in performance over the field-proven .270 Win. and .30-’06 Sprg. chamberings. Furthermore, ammunition in the latter chamberings is universally available and, generally, less costly, too. It’s also worthy of note that newly designed bullets and loads are first offered in .270 Win. and .30-’06 Sprg. and then, sometimes, the technology trickles down to the .280 Rem. That being said, there’s a dedicated following that extols the virtues of the .280 Rem. and places it among the cartridge greats. The cartridge’s proponents generally attribute its greatness to a large selection of 0.284”-diameter bullets-from 110 grs. to 180 grs.-with remarkably high ballistic coefficients, which it propels to respectable velocities. To them, this gives the .280 Rem. an edge over the elder cartridges. So, what’s your take on the .280 Rem.?   </p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Mepro M21 Reflex Sight]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://themakogroup.com" target="_blank">Mepro M21</a> non-magnifying reflex sight from Meprolight is powered by a fiber-optic collector and a tritium gas tube that illuminate its reticle during daylight and night time, respectively, and that are self-regulating for brightness. That means that, unlike most reflex sights on the market, the M21does not require batteries and is devoid of external wires and switches, enhancing its general durability and water-resistance characteristics.</p><p>Developed in conjunction with the Israeli military for use on its Tavor bullpup rifle the Mepro 21 has been tested in combat since its development in 2002. Not surprisingly, then, our test sample immediately conveyed the appearance and feel of a no-nonsense, well-built piece of optical gear. Its one-piece aluminum alloy housing and flush-mounted adjustment knobs, which exhibit tactile clicks when their slots are turned with a coin or cartridge rim, make its exterior durable and snag-free. And its 41/2-inch length takes up minimal space-approximately 12 slots-on a standard Picatinny rail.</p><p>Our unit came equipped with a double throw-lever mount, held neatly to the its underside with large Torx-head machine screws, making attachment and detachment from the two different 5.56x45 mm NATO flat-top rifles used to test it-an IWI Tavor SAR and an AR-15-quick and repeatable. Other adapters, such as one for an AR carry handle, are available. Our Mepro 21 also featured the “bullseye” reticle, consisting of a four-section outer ring surrounding a dot. Again, several other designs are available depending on user preferences and needs. Reticle height is approximately 1.65 inches, or 42 mm, above the rail’s top surface.</p><p>We fired several kinds of ammunition from both an indoor bench and from various positions in the field in a wide range of temperatures, detaching and remounting the M21 several times. It not only acceptably returned to zero, it also properly “shot the square,” although several users noted that its adjustments were rather coarse at 1 m.o.a. per click. Despite that fact, we were able to produce groups consistent with the sight's intended CQB application using its 4.3-m.o.a. center dot. In a variety of lighting conditions ranging from dimly lit rooms to snow-covered landscapes, the orange-tinted reticle proved bright and sharply defined with only one significant instance of “washout” occurring as it was aimed from inside a shaded position onto a snow-covered field. Even then, the bullseye was faintly visible and proper aiming could still be accomplished when specifically targeting somewhat darker objects.</p><p>The Meprolight M21 is competitively priced when compared with other military-grade reflex sights, and it offers the advantages of automatic brightness control and battery-free operation. It is ideally suited for modern, lightweight semi-automatic self-defense rifles, which may need to be called into action on a moment’s notice when the lack of necessity to “activate” a sight or replace depleted batteries could prove a critical advantage.</p><p><a href="http://themakogroup.com" target="_blank"><strong>Mepro M21</strong></a></p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Meprolight, P.O.

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>We have all heard the warnings of spontaneous CR-123 battery combustion, but where can you find a reliable source that actually confirms it happens? The FAA keeps track of battery incidents-most related to cargo-although the passenger and crew experiences provide some valuable lessons for today’s shooter.</p><p>Thankfully, it has been quiet for a while. The most recent problem occurred on Aug. 28, 2010, when a FedEx crewmember had the CR-123s installed in his flashlight suffer a thermal runaway that set his bag on fire while waiting for his flight. The report doesn’t list a cause, but rough handling or counterfeit batteries seem most likely as you read on.</p><p>Sometimes when I get into a hurry, I toss CR-123s in my range bag. On May 6, 2010, at the Seattle-Tacoma airport, a pair came into contact inside a checked bag, an airline employee heard the pop, saw the sparks, witnessed the flames, police arrived, the terminal was evacuated, the owner is probably on a “no fly” list somewhere and I’ll never forget my <a href="http://www.surefire.com/sc1-spares-carrier.html" target="_blank">SureFire SC1</a> again.</p><p>A CR-123-powered flashlight used by a flight-crew member to inspect the aircraft dimmed unexplainably on March 18, 2008. He turned it off and put it away. The crew reported hearing sounds like “gunshots” as the tailcap “became projectile,” according to the FAA. One person suffered burns to the hands and fingers while moving the flashlight.</p><p>On Valentine’s Day, 2008, flashlight batteries caught fire in an overhead compartment as an International flight was boarding. The FAA report doesn’t confirm the culprit cells were CR-123s, but it does specify a small flashlight.</p><p>A flight from Buenos Aires to Miami on March 19, 2007, got particularly exciting when someone in business class dropped a CR-123 from his digital camera. It landed on the seat, arced into the metal frame, set off sparks, smoke and launched a battery fragment into a passenger when it shattered/exploded. The plane arrived safely with four damaged seats and seven members of the flight crew suffering from smoke inhalation.</p><p>On December 14, 2006, a counterfeit CR-123 caught fire after a crewmember had dropped the flashlight from a height of 6 inches. The most dangerous April fool’s joke of 2004 was on a flight attendant who just purchased an inexpensive flashlight overseas. A passenger borrowed and dropped it. It then overheated, began smoking and it took oven mitts to move it to the galley where it was probably used to heat coffee.</p><p>In all honestly, the report linked above indicates laptop, MP3 player, tablet, cell phone, breathing device and even C-cell batteries cause more problems with air travel. But, it’s amazing how dangerous counterfeit CR-123 batteries can be. <a href="http://www.surefire.com/counterfeit-battery-warning" target="_blank">SureFire has issued a warning</a> that includes a pretty good explanation of the dangers. The firearm industry isn’t the only one affected. Canon has a pretty good collection of counterfeit vs. genuine camera product photos (<a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/about_canon/standard_display/sampleimages?WT.mc_id=C201983" target="_blank">in a quiz</a>) and <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/about_canon/standard_display/helpfultips?WT.mc_id=C201982" target="_blank">tips</a> that apply pretty much anytime you’re considering a purchase of electronics gear. Nikon’s <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/about_canon/standard_display/helpfultips?WT.mc_id=C201982" target="_blank">photos of counterfeits</a> also demonstrate how shoddy graphics/lettering is usually a good tipoff you’re about to be ripped on in that purchase.</p><p>The TSA requirement that I separate and insulate my spare camera and flash batteries seems more reasonable after reading the report-and something we should all consider, even when heading to the range.</p><p>And, if you did happen to purchase a 12-pack of cheap knockoff batteries, take heart. You have one tactical advantage during a criminal encounter. If the perp’s behind cover, drop your tactical flashlight from 6 inches or more, count to three, toss it toward the bad guy, take cover and scream, “Fire in the Hole!”</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA["The Gunny" Speaks: Saving Private K9]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>We recently had a chance to speak to everybody's favorite Gunnery Sergeant, R. Lee "The Gunny" Ermey, about some of his latest projects. Chief among these is his newest TV show, "Saving Private K9." So, square yourself away and listen up, recruits!</p><p><em>American Rifleman: </em>It was exciting to see you at the 143rd NRA Annual Meetings &amp; Exhibits in Indianapolis; that was the first time many people had heard about your new TV show, “<a href="http://www.thesportsmanchannel.com/shows/saving-private-k-9/">Saving Private K-9</a>,” premiering May 15 on the Sportsman Channel. Did you get to talk to many of your fans about the new show while you were there?</p><p><em>Gunny: </em>Oh yeah, I talked to hundreds of my fans while I was there. People will stand in line for hours to see me and I appreciate that very much. And while I was at the Sportsman Channel booth, I used their speaker system to blast out a message to encourage people to tune in. People are very receptive; we Americans love our dogs. I don’t know of many households that don’t have dogs. I heard at one time the most frequently purchased birthday gift for an eight-year-old boy is a dog.</p><p><em>American Rifleman: </em>With over 122 movies and TV shows to your credit, you must have a lot of demands on your time. What attracted you to being part of this specific project?</p><p><em>Gunny: </em>Mrs. Gunny keeps pointing out that I should think about retiring, but I think not. I’m happy working, so why not continue to work? I can’t think of a more interesting show to present to America than military working dogs. Dogs save lives in the military and police forces, and sometimes are more effective than us humans.</p><p>I also visited the WWII dog cemetery in Guam a while back, and that stimulated my interest. I’ve always had dogs growing up and, at one point, we had six in our household. They have always been close to my heart. My first dog’s name was Tippie, a big farm dog, half Collie half something else. Tippie’s job on the farm was to collect the cows for me and bring them up to the barn so we could milk them. She did a great job and was very smart.</p><p><em>American Rifleman: </em>Have the ways in which the military works with dogs changed much since you were an active-duty Marine?</p><p><em>Gunny: </em>I don’t think they've really changed that much. The only things I’ve noticed is that they are using dogs more; they are more dependent on the dogs than before. They realize better now how dogs can save human lives. Their senses are much keener than ours. I would like to see military and law enforcement more active in the retirement with MWDs (military working dogs). I’d like to see these dogs retired to a much more posh environment where they can run and be free. Plus, for those ready for adoption, we need to figure out a way to expedite the process. People are lined up waiting for these dogs for months! These dogs can be retrained and are loving, caring, sweet animals that just require a little love and time. Hopefully through the course of the show it will bring awareness not only on adoption possibilities, but also how intelligent these animals are and they still have a place with us.</p><p><em>American Rifleman: </em>What’s the most rewarding thing about filming this project for you? The toughest?</p><p><em>The Gunny: </em>The most rewarding thing is reuniting handlers with their dogs. When an IED has gone off and the handler is medevaced one way and the dog goes off in another direction, they lose each other. The handler never stops looking for his dog; we’ve found that in several situations. I tell you what, while we are filming, I’m talking to the handler and I’ll look up and the cameraman and sound guys have tears running down their cheeks and facial tissue in hand. There’s not a dry eye in the house.</p><p>And these dogs never forget their handlers. They have a keen memory. It is a beautiful thing seeing them reunited with their handlers.</p><p>The toughest cases were times when we found the dog had died. We took the handlers to their dog’s gravesite, and that was hard.</p><p><em></em><em>American Rifleman: </em>It looks like you’ve got a new <a href="http://www.rleeermey.com/">book</a> out, <em>Gunny’s Rules: How to Get Squared Away Like a Marine. </em>Tell us: Is there a noun that would apply to someone who doesn’t buy it because they spent all their money on chai lattes?</p><p><em>The Gunny: "</em>Numbnuts" would be the right word. Everyone needs to read this book. I highly recommended anyone in the military read this book; even businessmen will find this a worthy read as it will help them lead-no matter if it’s a meeting they are leading or a company. Young people in their teens seem to really benefit from the guidance, life skills points, and encouragement they receive from reading the book, also.</p><p>Readers can learn more about adopting MWDs from the official <a href="http://www.37trw.af.mil/units/37traininggroup/341sttrainingsquadron/index.asp">DoD 37th Training Wing</a> and the <a href="http://warriordogfoundation.org/contact-us-2">Warrior Dog Foundation</a>.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Throwback Thursday: The Evolution of a Guncrank's Wife]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><em>By Margaret Eimer</em></p><p>We have the golf widow, the club widow, any number of temporary widows-but I ask you, is there anything more soul-destroying, more boring, than a husband who is a gun crank? Take, for example, the occasion when Mr. Peep Sight calls on Mr. Bolt Action, bringing Mrs. Peep with him. The two women could leave the house, take in a dance, a theater, and a movie, return home in the wee sma' hours, and find that their collective husbands had never even known they were gone! If the ladies do stay at home they will entirely have exhausted: Clothes; the new hats; children; cosmetics; cards; scandals near, far, old and new; food; blondes; anything-else-you-can-think-of, and then find two surprised and injured husbands when Mrs. Peep undertakes to drag the mister home.</p><p>One can stand for that, occasionally; but that Sunday after Sunday on the range, just pecking away at a piece of paper, with wife and child entirely forgotten-it gets old. It implants a bitter seed that gets watered so thoroughly that it grows and grows until divorce loses its horns and tail, and becomes a sweet image suffused with golden light. You figure on new curtains-you simply must have new curtains-and when you are clearing your throat one pleasant evening to call the bread-winner's attention to the rags draping the windows, he is deep in a little book. Before you can penetrate his consciousness-if any-he announces in a glad, ringing voice:</p><p>"Here's just the thing I've wanted! I believe if I get one of these sights I can lick Pistol Grip! Pistol isn't really so hot, it's just his sights and that gun of his. Only eight dollars for this one, and Gold Bead Smith won't charge me much for putting it on. I believe I'll order that right now."</p><p>Well, you do one of two things. Either you blast him with the dammed-up flood of gun grievances until you are holding your arms high and shrieking "Guns! Guns!" so that he has to clout you on the head and stretch you out cold; or you arise, give him a long, heart-broken look, silently sneak off to bed and thoroughly wet the pillow, hoping he finds you a sweet lily-white corpse in the morning.</p><p>What happens then? He is entirely blind to your wan, tragic face next morning. He dashed off to get his order in the mail, never even noticing that your breakfast is untasted. He runs about in circles waiting for the sight to arrive. He throws books and magazines right and left looking for "that article," accusing you of having thrown it away, and offering no apologies later when he discovers he has loaned the magazine to a fellow crank. He runs more circles until Gold Bead gets the sight in place. He rises with the dawn the following Sunday, and beats it out to the range, even forgetting to kiss you good-by. Not, you bitterly reflect, that it matters. You know well enough that the evening will be given over to alibis, old and new. They always are.</p><p>Being a woman, and married, I am a natural cross-bearer; but one cross too many was heaved on me. We were then on a ranch, and there came a letter announcing company.</p><p>Company!</p><p>Put yourself on a Western ranch, 100 miles from a railroad, 10 miles from a measly village, 4 miles from neighbors-such as they were. People who could speak the king's English, or, well, if not the king's, anyhow, English! Company! A direct gift from the gods!</p><p>I fed them justly famous cornmeal pancakes for breakfast. I browned roasts as they had never been browned before. My dumplings dimpled, my pies were huge smiles. It all might as well have been sawdust. "Have some spuds, Ballistic-at 600 yards you simply got to figure on a mirage, and if you haven't got an A-1 telescope-" "A little more meat, Gunny-I don't really believe in sighting shots, after you once got your gun set. We got a man in our club-" "Oh, the biscuits, Mrs. Gunny? Yes, they were very nice-two years ago when I was at Perry-"</p><p>It was the last straw. The cross had busted me clean in two. I wept, both softly and loudly. I hated Gunny, all his works, all his friends, and especially the friends. I was glad they had gone. I hoped they all went down the deepest canyon at the divide, and broke their necks in three places. I would take my husband's favorite gun by the barrel, and bring the stock down on his head until one or the other smashed-preferably both.</p><p>Well, one doesn't weep forever, and both husband and gun were out somewhere, anyhow. So I sat and thought. We would be leaving the ranch soon, and that meant rifle clubs again. True, I hated Gunny, but still-well- Thought in time brought reason, of a sort. Starting, then, from the ground up: I didn't like guns. They were, so to speak, my enemies. Now then, I asked, just why didn't I like guns? I didn't really know anything about them. For all I knew they might be interesting-there really must be something about them.</p><p>Very well, I would find out. I would surprise and possibly delight my lord and master (a technical title) by asking him about his affinities. I did-and he was. It wound up with a delighted husband leading an eager wife into the yard. Eager on the outside, that is. "Oh no, Dearie, I wanted to shoot a big gun-I want to shoot what you do!"-it's so easy to fool a man. He often remarked, later, how calmly I pulled the trigger on that Mauser. I really expected the end of the world, and was a most surprised mortal when, after the blast, my ears were intact, nothing had kicked me, the gun was still in my hands. Call it accident if you like; I think it was the just reward of my noble resolve, when I came close to the black, in the four ring. You can't tell me that the particular guardian of guns didn't reach out a hand, grab that bullet, and stick it through there. But ah and alas! The hand then came up to me and put a brand on me, so that never, never, would I be again the same.</p><p>I'd like to say that life now assumed a new aspect. I'd like to tell how I mixed batter with a gun barrel, and decorated a darling lampshade with powder and designs made with bullets. But all achievement is the result of hard labor and determination. I had to learn, gradually, to like the things. I had to put that eager smile on my face and pull a steady trigger with never a flinch or the batting of an eye, when I wanted to run away and hide. I had to ask about the merits of this and that gun, happy to find if but one little thing held my interest. I had to lay down an interesting book and listen, enraptured, to monologs on guns. I had to reach eagerly for The Rifleman when told of a certain article. (I shall always hate the name Crossman, for that.)</p><p>Why did I? I couldn't see any other way. I was not going to be like Mrs. Spring Field, who worked herself into a rage every time she passed "his" gun cabinet. Oh, those gun cabinets! Or, like Mrs. Lever Action, cousin to Bolt, who actually got a divorce from Lever because of his guns. I was sick, too, of crosses, borne meekly or otherwise.</p><p>My reward finally came when we left the ranch and I, overalled, went out to the range with friend husband. I and gone out many times in the past, of course, sitting in the car, bored to tears. But this time I lugged my own gun (it represented not only new curtains, but a dress or two besides), loaded it, and stood up beside a dapper, rather shocked young man. Naturally he beat me, but my score wasn't at all bad. And when we moved to 500 yards my score, the first one, was 46! Was it a grand and glorious feeling? And a few weeks later the man sprawled out beside me at the same range threw down his gun and went home because his score was below mine. Some men take it so hard!</p><p>I wish Mrs. Peep Sight and Mrs. Bolt Action would get in the game. It's so much more fun packing a lunch basket to take along out to the range on Sunday-to get there in the morning when the light is good-than to give Peep a grudging kiss when he leaves. Or worse, not kiss him at all. Much more fun to sit of an evening and live the day over again, speculating on the if's and when's, and arguing on the relative merits of sights, and how hard it is to use an issue Springfield when your arm is as long as mine and the short stock wallops you; and isn't Sam Expert a short sport, and what a pity,too.</p><p>Next year I am going to Camp Perry. It would be a pity to stay away; for haven't I a swell alibi, which everyone agrees should never, never, be wasted? Living in the high, dry mountain country of the Southwest, and going to the low, hot lake climate, with rain and mosquitoes and everything-the alibi works every day, at every range!</p><p>I think the N.R.A. should issue a special medal for gun cranks' wives who play the game with them-a solid gold one, with curlicues all over it, for those like me who laboriously, and against a natural inclination, become bona-fide members of the Grand Order of Targeteers.</p><p>Still, we got our reward without a medal, at that.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[The .221 Remington Fireball Fits]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>The whip-hand dominance of the .223 Rem. has littered the boneyard with nearly all other 22-cal. center-fire cartridges; however, the .221 Rem. Fireball remains just outside that acre’s gate because informed handloaders look at it from a different perspective than those who see it as merely a short .223. Besides, you have to like a cartridge with a cool-sounding name such as “Fireball.”</p><p>The .221 case is a close copy of the .223. Both cases have the same head diameter, shoulder angle, neck length and maximum average pressure (MAP) of 55,000 p.s.i. The only difference is that the .221 is shortened 0.3674 inches in the body. That reduces its propellant capacity to 60 percent of the .223s. But loaded with the proper propellants, the .221 produces about 90 percent of the .223’s velocity with bullets weighing up to 55 grains.</p><p><strong>Beginnings</strong></p><p>This short cartridge was initially chambered in Remington’s XP-100 bolt-action single-shot handgun in 1963. From the XP-100’s original 10.75-inch barrel, the .221 fired 50-grain bullets at about 2600 f.p.s. The XP-100’s barrel was eventually lengthened to 14.5 inches and chambered in other .22-cal. cartridges such as the .223 Rem. and .22-250 Rem. The .221 chambering lasted until 1985. For a while Thompson/Center chambered the cartridge in its Contender single-shot handgun. The .221 languished in neglect until 2002 when Remington gave it a face-lift as a rifle cartridge in its Model 700 Classic rifle. The last year Remington chambered the cartridge was in 2007 in the Model 700 Light Varmint Stainless Fluted rifle.</p><p>The CZ 527 American and the Model 21 from Cooper Firearms of Montana are the only rifles currently chambered in .221 by major manufacturers. The Cooper folks say the .221 is nowhere near as popular as the .204 Ruger or .223 Rem. But the cartridge has a following, and they sell about as many rifles chambered in the Fireball as they do rifles in .22 Hornet.</p><p>A Cooper Model 21 Montana Varminter was used to shoot the loads for this article. The Varminter is intended for shooting from a rest, with style. The oil finish highlights the running grain of its AA+ claro walnut stock with a beavertail fore-end. The Model 21 is a single-shot. Pushing forward the three-lug bolt picks up a cartridge from the loading pan, feeding it into the chamber. The sample rifle’s trigger has a perfect 2-pound pull.</p><p><strong>Handloading</strong></p><p>The Fireball case is only a smidgen larger than the Hornet case. The 3 to 8 grains of additional propellant the .221 holds, though, result in a gain of 600 f.p.s. over the Hornet with bullets of the same weight. Care should be taken when developing loads for a cartridge as small as the .221 because a big increase in velocity and pressure results from a small increase in propellant. From the Cooper Model 21’s 24-inch barrel, Nosler 35-grain Ballistic Tip Lead Free bullets had an average velocity of 2752 f.p.s. powered by 17.0 grains of H4198. Stepping up the propellant to 17.5 grains increased velocity to 2949 f.p.s. An additional 0.5 grain jumped speed to 3034 f.p.s, and 18.5 grains upped the velocity to 3,296 f.p.s.</p><p>Relatively fast-burning propellants such as Hodgdon’s H4198, Lil’Gun and Accurate 1680 are a key to loading the .221. Lil’Gun is a great propellant for the Fireball shooting lightweight bullets. From two other .221 rifles, Lil’Gun fired Berger 30-grain Varmint bullets at nearly 3900 f.p.s. and Nosler 35-grain Ballistic Tip Lead-Free bullets at 3700 f.p.s. From the Cooper Varminter, Hornady 40-grain V-MAX bullets reached 3270 f.p.s. with 15.0 grains of the propellant and 3460 f.p.s. with 15.5 grains.</p><p>Relatively slow-burning propellants provide a more sustained push to 50-grain and heavier bullets. Lil’Gun and A1680 are still good choices as well as H335, H4198, N130 and Reloder 7.</p><p>Heavier bullets also provide more uniform velocities. The 30- and 35-grain bullets had extreme spreads of velocity of up to 200 f.p.s with several different propellants. But spreads shrank to less than 50 f.p.s. with 40-grain bullets and down to 10 f.p.s. with 50 and 55-grain bullets.</p><p>How close to seat bullets to rifling lands for the best accuracy is a matter of hundredths of an inch. Bullets close to, or even in contact with, the rifling are thought to function with improved accuracy because they make less of an unsupported “jump” before  engaging it. That minimizes the chance of bullets entering the rifling at an angle and flying into left field. Just as important, though, bullets seated straight with the centerline of case necks align with the chamber throat to ensure they enter the rifling straight, even if they have to move a ways to engage it.</p><p>The .221’s maximum cartridge length is 1.830". However, Nosler 55-grain Ballistic Tips just touch the rifling lands of the Cooper .221 with a cartridge length of 1.873 inches. The Cooper rifle has no magazine, so that long cartridge length fits fine. A smidgen shorter cartridge length, though, ensures easy extraction of an unfired cartridge from the chamber. Also, pressures tend to be greater when bullets do not have a bit of a running start before contacting rifling.</p><p>To determine if accuracy was better with bullets seated just short of the rifling compared to seated back a ways, I loaded 10 cartridges each with the Ballistic Tips seated with an overall length of 1.850 inches and 1.830 inches. Before shooting I ran the cartridges through a Hornady Lock-N-Load Concentricity Tool. The majority of the bullets were absolutely true with the case necks but a few varied up to 0.002 inches. The longer cartridges averaged 0.96 inches for two, five-shot groups. The shorter cartridges averaged 0.95 inches.</p><p><strong>Shooting</strong></p><p>After firing 20 shots at a fast pace, the Cooper’s barrel was lukewarm and the front third remained cold. Even though the temperature was in the 20s, heat rising from the barrel created barely any mirage through the Leupold 14X riflescope. Recoil was so mild that the crosshairs scarcely jumped off target, and often I saw bullet holes appear instantly. The Cooper Varminter shot well. It probably would have shot even tighter groups, but there was the shiver factor to consider from the cold temperatures. It helped, though, thinking about warm spring days ahead and green fields of ground squirrels and prairie dogs.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/221.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-33526" title=".221" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/221.jpg" alt=".221" width="770" height="422" /></a></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>At a press conference outside of police headquarters yesterday, Detroit (Mich.) Police Chief James Craig reiterated his staunch support for gun rights for law-abiding citizens. His comments were in response to reaction to the <a href="http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/3ac0b16d#/3ac0b16d/79" target="_blank">cover story</a> in the June 2014 issue of <em>America's 1st Freedom, </em>an official journal of the <a href="http://home.nra.org" target="_blank">National Rifle Association</a>.</p><p>In <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20140519/METRO01/305190030/Craig-stands-by-2nd-Amendment-support-wake-NRA-magazine-cover-story" target="_blank">an interview to <em>The Detroit News</em></a> earlier in the day, Craig said he supports the right of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms. "It is the law, and I support the law," he said. "The Second Amendment was written more than 200 years ago, it is not the James Craig law."</p><p>In the wake of an alarmingly rising crime rate and a reduced law-enforcement presence, Detroit residents are turning to self-protection, evidenced by an increase in applications for concealed-carry permits. Local Detroit news outlets are reporting numerous accounts of armed citizens defending themselves and their families from harm.</p><p>In the cover story, Craig referenced this trend: "I believe responsible, good Americans have a right to protect themselves from an immediate threat to their life or to the life of another," while refuting the notion that he is inciting vigilantism. " ... This is about self-defense, protection, an imminent threat to life," he said. Craig reports that they are now driving down crime in Detroit, "and certainly the Detroit Police Department is doing a phenomenal job arresting the right people."</p><p>Read the complete cover story <a href="http://www.nrapublications.org/index.php/17751/a-show-of-courage-in-detroit/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Don’t Let Recoil Ruin Your Shooting Fun]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Practically the only bad thing about shooting is recoil-and there are various ways to ensure it doesn’t mess up an otherwise good thing. In this two-part series, we’ll look at alternatives to taking a beating from recoil.</p><p><strong>Beginners</strong>-or anyone-bothered by a firearm’s recoil (or kick) can always opt for lighter-recoiling guns or calibers. Of course the shooting public collectively knows this, as evidenced by the fast-growing popularity light kickers like .223 rifles and .380 handguns, not to mention the enduring dominance of the virtually kick-free .22 rimfire. You no longer hear a lot of guff from old know-it-alls who mocked those rounds or snorted at the thought of using a 9mm, .243 Win., or 20 gauge. Good riddance, I say. No matter if you’re shooting a .22 or a thunder magnum, the fundamental skills are the same, and so is the degree of difficulty. The main difference is the fun of plinking away, competing or hunting with a gun that doesn’t exact a price in pain. Let’s be clear, you can’t accomplish every shooting task with mild-mannered hardware-but you can do a lot. Here’s a look at nine low-recoil cartridge options encompassing pistols, rifles and shotguns.</p><p><strong>.22 LR</strong>-America regards .22s as if they’re gold-plated fun. Whether handgun or rifle shooting, this is the first stop for most of us, the training tool from which we learn gun safety and the basics of sighting, breathing and trigger control. The .22 prepares us for more good times with other guns, but no matter what  you shoot or how often, you will continue to find the little rimfire challenging and enjoyable, the perfect blend of “can do” and “tougher than it looks.” Most lifelong shooters wouldn’t consider not owning a .22. <strong>Kick quotient-nothing but the noise</strong>.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1911_22_zg.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-33668" title="1911_22_zg" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1911_22_zg.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="303" /></a></p><p><strong>.22 WMR</strong>-Handguns chambered for .22 WMR are every bit as entertaining to shoot as .22 LR models, but can also be considered legitimate defensive arms, if only in last-ditch circumstances at little-more-than-arms-length ranges. From pocket-sized guns with barrels at least 1-7/8 inches long, the magnum rimfire shooting a 40-gr. bullet will penetrate light clothing and 8 inches or more of ballistic gelatin, while expanding 1.5 times its normal diameter. It’s enough to give you a fighting chance against an assailant, though bigger would be better (see the .380 ACP next). Revolvers in .22 WMR abound, some very small and concealable, as well as bigger models for plinking or pest hunting. <strong>Kick quotient-a definite twitch</strong>.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/charter_arms_22_wmr_zg.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-33669" title="charter_arms_22_wmr_zg" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/charter_arms_22_wmr_zg.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="327" /></a></p><p><strong>.380 ACP</strong>-In recent years, handgun makers report their biggest sales growth has come from subcompact semi-autos chambered for the .380. The rush comes on the heels of many first-time owners, women in particular, buying guns for personal protection. Although these mini-pistols don’t rival the stopping power of traditional combat models, they offer distinct advantages for everyday carry and shooting manageability. If you’ve got yours with you and have learned how to use it, you won’t go into a confrontation unarmed. <strong>Kick quotient-hearty handshake</strong>.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/glock_380acp_zg.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-33670" title="glock_380acp_zg" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/glock_380acp_zg.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="357" /></a></p><p><strong>9 mm</strong>-Strong opinion-and evidence--still exists that the 9 mm doesn’t measure up as a stopper compared to the .45 ACP. Even so, 9 mm pistols are the pick of militaries, LE agencies and security experts around the globe. Generous magazine capacity, along with the almost-universal preference for frequent training with a moderate kicker has elevated the ubiquitous 9 mm to number one. <strong>Kick quotient-noticeable</strong>.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/9mm_zg.jpg"><img title="9mm_zg" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/9mm_zg.jpg" alt="" width="477" height="427" /></a></p><p><strong>.223 Rem./5.56 NATO</strong>-Tried to find this stuff on retail shelves lately? Then you know you’re not alone. It’s you and a new legion of shooters psyched to fire all those recently purchased AR-type rifles in range sessions, 3-gun matches and elsewhere. Which begs the question: How much does the shooting-enjoyment factor (minuscule recoil) account for the AR’s resurgent popularity? The .223, by the way, is also a stellar varmint/predator cartridge, and a top choice for deer hunting in Texas and other states where it is legal. <strong>Kick quotient-mild bump</strong>.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/223_zg.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-33666" title="223_zg" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/223_zg.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="272" /></a></p><p><strong>.243 Win</strong>-There’s a campfire legend-corroborated by many guides-that First Nations people across northern Canada rely heavily on the .243 Win. for caribou hunting. My sources swear the ammo disappears from the local Canadian Tire shortly before the truck or supply plane leaves town, and in short order villagers are piling ATVs and snowmobiles high with carcasses. And so if it works well on a 400-pound caribou … ? Yes, it’s that much better for anything in the deer/antelope class. You can even hear .243 tales involving black bears and elk (some are true). It’s not just accuracy magic that this little caliber produces so much beginner’s luck and Arctic sustenance-everyone likes to shoot it. <strong>Kick quotient-barely more than a tap</strong>.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/243win_zg.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-33667" title="243win_zg" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/243win_zg.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="281" /></a></p><p><strong>.260 Rem./6.5 Creedmoor/6.5-.284 Norma</strong>-This cartridge niche remains formative, with several contenders vying for market share.

Accuracy with many rifles is Grade A, so much so that highpower rifle competitors flocked to the .260/6.5 newcomers a few years back, delighted with X-ring hits and the dearth of cumulative recoil. Long-range hunters have now caught on, and accordingly this class is gaining cred as the ideal balance of speed and terminal performance. <strong>Kick quotient- friendly clap on the shoulder</strong>.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/65_creedmore_zg.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-33665" title="65_creedmore_zg" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/65_creedmore_zg.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="387" /></a></p><p><strong>28-gauge shotshell</strong>- Practically everyone who writes about 28-gauge shotguns gushes, using words like, “delightful … graceful … nimble,” etc. In fact, all those compliments come in comparison to bigger 12- and 20-gauge shotguns. And the reason the 28 fares so favorably? Less recoil. However, unlike the situation with pistols and rifles, where marksmanship proficiency isn’t dependent on gun or ammunition size (and often the smaller the better), the bigger gauges’ increased shot charges gives shooters more pellets with which to hit their flying targets. Newcomers may struggle with a 28-gauge gun, and for serious competition or hunting, 28-gauge shotguns are the tools of experts. <strong>Kick quotient-playful nudge</strong>.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wby_28_gauge_zg.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-33671" title="wby_28_gauge_zg" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wby_28_gauge_zg.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="274" /></a></p><p><strong>20-gauge shotshell</strong>-Many might consider this one borderline, but let’s run some numbers based on popular target loads: 28-gauge ¾ -ounce-12.8 ft.-lbs. recoil energy; 20-gauge 1 ounce-21.0 ft.-lbs. energy; 12-gauge 1¼-ounce-32.0 ft.-lbs. energy. The 20-gauge skews closer to the 28 than to the big 12, which kicks 37 percent harder. Nonetheless, the aforementioned 20-gauge load with No. 8 shot packs more than 400 pellets, enough so that even rookies have a fair chance of breaking targets. Bird hunters rely on 20-gauge guns for most types of game, and while limited for geese and turkeys, hard-core dove and quail sports proudly prefer the sub-gauge.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/20gauge_zg.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-33664" title="20gauge_zg" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/20gauge_zg.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="284" /></a></p><p><strong><em>Part 2-Check out John Zent’s <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/Blogs-Gun-Culture" target="_blank">Gun Culture blog</a> later this week for tips on making the recoil for big guns more manageable.</em></strong></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[.410 Slugs for Deer Hunting?]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>If you’re like me, you’ve pondered the suitability of .410 slugs for whitetail deer hunting. However, there’s little consensus about the subject; in fact, even ammunition companies’ stances are often at odds. For example, <a href="http://www.brennekeusa.com" target="_blank">Brenneke USA</a> promotes its 2½” and 3” for use on small game and, more specifically, coyotes, as well as for self-defense, while <a href="http://www.federalpremium.com" target="_blank">Federal Cartridge Co.</a> displays a deer emblem, thereby suggesting its effectiveness for the smaller, big-game species. Too, in searching the internet forums, there are actually few reliable field reports, though those who have employed them on whitetail deer understood their range limitations and were pleased with their performance.</p><p>Further compounding the dilemma, in crunching the numbers, Federal’s Power-Shok 2½”, 1/4-oz. (109.375-gr.) slug propelled to 1775 f.p.s. produces 765 ft.-lbs. of energy at the muzzle, which is more than even the field-proven <a href="http://www.hornady.com" target="_blank">Hornady</a> 10 mm Auto 180-gr. XTP load-it produces 556 ft.-lbs. at the muzzle. Granted, the latter will, by virtue of its construction, penetrate deeper. As such, it makes sense that the .410 would “work” on deer-size game; however, I wanted empirical evidence rather than conjecture and unsubstantiated reports, so I worked with Federal Cartridge Co. to determine the .410’s terminal performance through animal hide into ordnance gelatin. The results: when fired from a <a href="http://www.savagearms.com" target="_blank">Savage Arms</a> Model 42 from 50 yds., the all-lead, .41-cal. slug penetrated to a depth of about 8½”. The slug’s oversize expansion diameter surely factored into the limited penetration.</p><p>All things considered, for a youth or <em>extremely</em> recoil-timid adult hunter, if he or she is willing to “pick” shots and try to avoid the scapula, I see no reason that the aforementioned load wouldn’t bring a whitetail deer to bag. In this case, bigger is better but smaller is sufficient.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>This week, a criminal shot a gorgeous young gal scheduled to marry into my family when she arrived home just before noon. Thankfully, her injury isn’t life threatening. She’s expected to make a full recovery, and hopefully it won’t delay this year’s wedding. However, there are some scary lessons in this incident.</p><p>When she arrived home, the open garage door didn’t raise any red flags. She proceeded into the house, discovered “loot” staged for a quick escape, saw furniture out of place and before she could exit a bad guy confronted and shot her. Obviously, there’s a lot more to the story, but my lack of detail is to ensure the integrity of the investigation underway. If my experience with the justice system is any indication, I might be able to fill in the missing pieces 18 months from now-if there’s no appeal.</p><p>How did the criminal know the home would be empty? He works, so that’s a given. She’s a stay-at-home mom, with a toddler (who thankfully escaped injury) who keeps her busy.</p><p><strong>Lesson One:</strong> Social media status updates are good at giving away your movements. The perp is still at large, so this is nothing more than family conjecture at this point. However, I know I’ve been guilty of telegraphing house vacancy in the past. No more. Does your profile list city and date of birth-the first security questions a bank asks? Can you say identify theft?</p><p><strong>Lesson Two:</strong> There’s genius in routine. If that garage door is religiously closed every morning and night, it telegraphs something is amiss, immediately.</p><p><strong>Lesson Three:</strong> Those things moved by the criminal for theft will probably be held as evidence that you might see back in 18 months-if there’s no appeal. That includes the firearms owned by law-abiding victims with a fresh concern for their family’s safety, even if the perp is still on the loose.</p><p><strong>Lesson Four:</strong> If you know someone who takes and passes the concealed carry course, but is “too busy” to process the paperwork at local law enforcement, tell them this nightmare. She passed the course. He did too, but neither of them went downtown to finish the paperwork. Things might have been different had she been carrying. His gun with him at work wouldn’t have helped that morning, but at least they’d have a something with which to defend themselves if the criminal returns-whenever she gets out of the hospital.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Now in its eighth year, the Washington, DC-based <a href="http://www.gifilmfestival.com">GI Film Festival </a>kicked off yesterday with a gala event heading up a week-long celebration of America’s military men and women as seen through eyes of creative filmmakers. A total of 56 films-ranging from full-length features to documentaries to shorts and from the Civil War through Iran and Afghanistan-will be screened at several locations throughout the capital area.</p><p>“This is the most emotionally compelling film line-up we’ve ever showcased,” said GIFF President Brandon Millett. “These films will shock you. They will move you. They will entertain you. And I guarantee you will come away with a greater understanding of military veterans of all generations and their families.”</p><p>Along with battlefield action scenes, the festival lineup explores issues faced by American GIs, from their letters home to post-traumatic stress to employment and marital difficulties. Highlights include the world premiere on May 25 of “Fort Bliss,” which follows the return of a decorated combat Medic (Michelle Monaghan) to life as a single mother; the narrative short “White Feather” profiling legendary Vietnam sniper Carlos Hathcock; and “When Hollywood Went to War,” a compilation of newsreel footage, home movies and other film assets about the U.S. Army Air Force’s First Motion Picture Unit, comprised of stars like Ronald Reagan, Clark Gable, Jimmy Stewart during World War II.</p><p>The 2014 festival launch took place at the Old Town Theater in historic Alexandria, Va., where GIFF hosted the world premiere of the Civil War epic, “The Field of Lost Shoes,” retelling a little-known story of valor when young cadets from the <a href="http://www.vmi.edu">Virginia Military Institute </a>marched to the front and ultimately played a pivotal role in defending their homeland against the invading Union army. The showing brought a glimmer of Tinseltown to the streets of Alexandria as VIP guests, media and attendees mingled on the red carpet with the film’s executive producer, Brandon Hogan, and one of its stars, David Arquette.</p><p>Later this week, americanrifleman.org will take a closer look at “The Field of Lost Shoes” production from the unique perspective of a current VMI cadet who has a small part in the movie.</p><p>The GI Film Festival is a non-profit endeavor founded 2006 by Brandon and Laura Law Millet. In addition to the growing annual flagship festival, the Millets announced plans to work with the Cinemark theater chain on a Fall 2014 tour of military-themed films, and with the U. S. Army on an upcoming road show to bases. Numerous sponsors, celebrities, military brass and political leaders have lined up to support GIFF.</p>]]></bodyContent>

The U.S.-made grip’s rigid core is over-molded with a black thermoplastic vulcanizate that is texturized with molded-in stippling. The material helps absorb recoil and is chemical-resistant. And the grip’s design, in which the finger groove area extends from the butt to the bottom of the trigger guard, increases the available surface area for the shooting hand. It is also claimed to align the shooter’s hand, wrist and arm, resulting in a more natural pointability and better control of the gun under recoil.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $20.</p><p><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="http://ergogrips.net" target="_blank">Ergo Grips,</a> P.O.

              <title><![CDATA[Bargain Hunting Rifles]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Saying American riflemen tend to be conservative is like saying trees tend to grow wood. That’s why new trends in hunting rifles often encounter resistance. One supposedly new way of marketing such guns is by referring to them as “affordable” or “value-priced,” but most Americans simply think of them as “cheap.” That has caused a good deal of grumbling, especially on the Internet, yet another new trend. Since few gun stores feature wood stoves these days, the formerly traditional venue for rifle discussions, shooters whine where we can. Some things never change.</p><p>In autumn, Americans still follow the old traditions, including hunting, eating turkey, and throwing sales across the country. During the fall of 2013 the following prices appeared before, during and after big-game season in my part of Montana:</p><p><a href="http://www.mossberg.com/products/rifles/centerfire/mossberg-atr" target="_blank"><strong>Mossberg ATR-$290</strong></a></p><p><a href="http://www.remington.com/model783" target="_blank"><strong>Remington 783-$320</strong></a></p><p><a href="http://www.ruger.com/products/americanRifle/index.html?utm_source=gunreports.com" target="_blank"><strong>Ruger American-$300</strong></a></p><p><a href="http://www.savagearms.com/firearms/model/axis" target="_blank"><strong>Savage Axis-$300</strong></a></p><p>While these rifles don’t look like the ones many hunters grew up shooting, they do not mean the end of civilization as we know it. To prove that point, some historical perspective might be useful. In the 1958 issue of Gun Digest well-known writer Bob Wallack reviewed recent American factory rifles, and had this to say about the Remington 721 and 722, the long and short-action versions of the company’s post-war bolt-action rifle: “The motto at Remington these days … is ‘all for production,’ so their rifles are designed for ease of manufacture and to sell at a certain price. Every part that can possibly be banged out on a punch press is banged out on a punch press, much to the sorrow of any real gun bug. Such methods do not affect the handling qualities or functioning of a rifle, certainly, but neither do they add up to a gun that a guy’d want to own with pride.” Though written over half a century ago, the spirit of Wallack’s comments would fit right in among many Internet posts.</p><p>Mass manufacturing really began when practical steam engines were developed in the late 1700s, about the time the United States was founded. In the 20th century, electricity sped up assembly lines considerably by giving machine tools individual motors, rather than keeping them dependent on belts off an overhead, steam-driven shaft. As a result, average Americans could afford not only functional firearms and sewing machines, but Model T Fords and Frigidaire refrigerators. Yet many of us still somehow believe that any factory-made products from before right now were of much finer quality, the reason many shooters now call the 721 and 722 Remington's “classics.”<a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/rifles.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-33720" title="rifles" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/rifles.jpg" alt="rifles" width="700" height="449" /></a></p><p>The Remington 721/722 appeared in 1948, but before World War II Savage made an even less costly and simpler rifle called the Model 23. The “action” was actually the rear end of the barrel, machined to take a bolt, trigger and detachable-box magazine. Designed for lower pressure cartridges, the Model 23 was chambered for the .22 Long Rifle, .22 Hornet, .25-20 Win. and .32-20 Win. Both the Remington and Savage rifles are just a small part of the long American of history of affordable, mass-produced firearms.</p><p>Like the Remington rifles, the Savages also shot accurately, and are now sometimes called classics. However, I own a Remington 722 and a pair of Savage 23s, and only their ages and walnut stocks might qualify as “classic.” Otherwise they were indeed designed to be made less expensively and hence sell for less than competing rifles. In fact, that is most of the reason for my Savage 23s in .25-20 Win. and .32-20 Win.: They’re still the least expensive rifles available in those “classic” chamberings.</p><p>I also own a Ruger American Rifle in .308 Win., and my wife, Eileen, owns a Savage Axis in .22-250 Rem. The most obvious difference between those 21st-century rifles and the Remington 721/722 and Savage 23 is their synthetic stocks, often called “Tupperware” by Wallack-world critics, because they’re made by injection-molding. (In reality this isn’t an entirely inexpensive method, since the machinery for making synthetic stocks costs several hundred thousand dollars. But after the initial investment, stocks can be cranked out for a few bucks apiece, and even faster than plain-grained walnut stocks could be machine-turned for the Remington 721/722 and Savage 23.)</p><p>Will shooters be calling the Ruger American and Savage Axis “classics” half a century from now? Perhaps, especially if somebody comes up with a process to mass-manufacture inexpensive synthetic stocks less prone to warping. No, injection-molded stocks don’t warp like wood does, because they do not absorb atmospheric moisture. But they don’t always come out of the mold absolutely straight, either. That can cause minor accuracy problems, since the four “fall-sale” rifles all supposedly have free-floated barrels.</p><p>Contrary to what many shooters believe, proper free-floating does not mean a folded dollar bill can be passed between barrel and fore-end. Instead the fore-end shouldn’t touch the barrel when the rifle is fired; contact can affect barrel harmonics, resulting in off-the-mark shots, often called “fliers.” Many early injection-molded stocks were nearly as floppy as foot-long hot dogs, but even today’s stiffer stocks require more than dollar-bill fore-end clearance.</p><p>I first fired an evaluation sample Ruger American on a combined long-range shooting school and hunt on the FTW Ranch in the Hill Country of Texas in September 2012. The rifle shot pretty well with the Hornady factory ammunition provided, taking an axis deer and clanging steel gongs out to 1,000 yards. Even so, a few unexpected fliers occurred, not all my fault, but I was intrigued enough to take the rifle home for more shooting.</p><p>My usual test for free-floating is to grasp the tip of the fore-end and the barrel in my right hand, and squeeze. If the barrel touches the fore-end, the stock’s not really free-floated, and the Ruger’s wasn’t floated quite enough. A couple of minutes with a round rasp solved the problem, and while the barreled action was out of the stock I adjusted the trigger to the minimum pull possible.</p><p>In Texas the scope was a <a href="http://www.burrisoptics.com/" target="_blank">4-16X Burris Eliminator III</a> (which worked great), but for this test I mounted another Burris, a 3-9X 40 mm Tactical Fullfield II with a 30 mm tube. Apparently that model isn’t offered anymore, but mine has proven reliable on several rifles, with very repeatable adjustments. I sighted in with Black Hills 175-grain match loads left from another project, and the first three-shot group at 100 yards measured 0.34 inches center-to-center. Not bad for a “cheap” rifle!</p><p>After adjusting the scope a little more, eight handloads were tested, using various propellants chosen from recent data showing high velocities, with bullet weights ranging from 110 to 200 grains. Three-shot groups ranged from 0.53 inches to 1.31 inches, and all the groups (including the Black Hills cloverleaf) averaged 0.92 inches. None of the handloads was worked-up specifically for the rifle; instead, the bullets were seated slightly shy of the lands over a mid-level propellant charge. Apparently sub-inch accuracy is “normal” for this .308 Win. American.</p><p>In Texas the rifle had been fired about 130 times without cleaning, and I still hit distant gongs. Back in Montana I cleaned the bore to bare steel (an easy job), and looked at it through a Hawkeye bore-scope. While not as smooth as a Krieger or Lilja, it wasn’t much different, which is typical of hammer-forged Ruger barrels produced during the past 20 years.</p><p>While in Texas I got to talk quite a bit with engineer Mark Gurney, who is <a href="http://www.ruger.com/index.html" target="_blank">Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co.’s</a> product manager and the head of the American project. Gurney said the rifle was designed by a committee-though fortunately not a government committee. None of the American’s features are new, but together they make the rifle not only functional but accurate. They include three locking lugs on the bolt, which allows for a lower bolt-throw and even distribution of the stresses imparted on the front of the action during firing. There are also stainless-steel bedding blocks molded into the stock, and the adjustable trigger has a tab in the main blade, preventing firing before the tab is depressed, allowing a clean pull of reasonable weight.</p><p>Eileen purchased the Savage Axis .22-250 Rem. slightly used, including the factory mounted 3-9X scope, and a used Axis is really affordable. During the past few years she’s started getting recoil headaches, so has switched to lighter-recoiling rifles and shotguns, and heard the .22-250 Rem. was not only effective on coyotes but pronghorns and deer. (Before anybody gets upset about the idea of using a “twenty-two” on big game, be aware that Montana allows their use and that the .22-250 Rem. is among the more popular deer/antelope rounds on the eastern plains.)</p><p>Eileen owns some pretty nice hunting rifles, including a pre-World War II German combination gun, a New Ultra Lights Arms .257 Roberts and a Kilimanjaro .308 Win. with a very fancy walnut stock. But when trying a new cartridge she often buys an economical rifle in case she doesn’t care for the new round.</p><p>She was initially pleased with the Axis, since it was fairly light and the stock fit her fairly well, which is not always the case with factory rifles. But she said the trigger was awfully heavy, and it was. Savage doesn’t use its Accu-Trigger on the Axis, and the pull on this one averaged around 5 pounds, 8 ounces.</p><p>I hand tuned it to a crisp 4-pound pull. That being said, Timney Mfg. offers a replacement trigger for the Axis, a good option for those who’d prefer a clean swap. I also scoped the bore and found that, like many Savage barrels, it had some reamer marks, so I installed Dyna Bore Coat to reduce fouling.</p><p>In thanks for all my work, Eileen graciously loaned me her rifle to test a dozen handloads with bullets ranging from 35 to 64 grains. As with the Ruger American, none of the loads were “worked up,” but even with the very inexpensive scope the 12 groups ranged from 0.37 inches to 1.41 inches, for an average of 0.96 inches.</p><p>Eileen handloaded a batch of ammunition with one of the more accurate loads featuring the new Cutting Edge Raptor monolithic bullet, but, while sighting-in, she decided the scope was insufficient. She likes more magnification than many hunters, normally leaving variables set on 10X, and has no difficulty killing big game even at 50 yards. She also doesn’t mind fixed-power scopes, so I suggested she try a new Bushnell Elite Tactical 10X40 mm sent for testing. She really liked both the optics and the precise adjustments, and a few days later dropped a doe pronghorn with one shot at 150 yards.</p><p>To see how two other recent affordable rifles worked, I borrowed a Mossberg ATR .308 Win. and a Remington Model 783 .30-'06 Sprg. Both have slightly off-line fore-ends, the Mossberg’s pressing against the left side of its barrel, and the Remington’s is flopping around on the underside of its barrel. If they had belonged to me, I would have taken a rasp to the fore-ends, but they didn’t. A Leupold FX-II 4X33 mm was mounted on the Mossberg and a Redfield Revolution 3-9X40 mm on the Remington-both were well-proven on other rifles.</p><p>At the range I shot both a factory load and a handload from each test rifle. The Mossberg averaged 1.38 inches for three-shot groups with the Black Hills 175-grain match load that the Ruger American shot so well, and 0.99 inches with a handload of the 150-grain Sierra Pro-Hunter and 46.0 grains of Hodgdon Varget. The fore-end pressure on the left side of the barrel didn’t have any apparent effect unless more than three rounds were fired quickly. The fourth round was always a flier to the right. (The front half of the Mossberg’s barrel, by the way, has what might be called “cosmetic fluting,” since the grooves are too short and shallow to save weight or dissipate heat.)</p><p>After getting on paper at 100 yards, the Remington’s first group measured a little over 2½ inches. I’m not even going to mention the brand, because two other brands of factory ammunition did about the same, even after I temporarily free-floated the barrel by placing a plastic tab from a bread-bag between stock and action, just behind the recoil lug. This often mitigates floppy-fore-end syndrome considerably, but I eventually gave up on factory loads and tried a handload using the 180-grain Nosler Partition and 58.0 grains of Ramshot Hunter. That load has proven itself in a number of rifles, and averaged 1.31 inches in the 783, good enough for any big-game hunting this side of 500 yards. For that matter, 2½ inches is good enough out to at least 200 yards for deer-size game.</p><p>All bolt-action rifles resemble each other in some ways, but the four “affordable” rifles reminded me somewhat of a small town in a remote mountain valley where it seems everybody’s related by blood or marriage. The Ruger stood out due to the three-lug bolt and steel bedding blocks, but otherwise the features were mixed up pretty well.</p><p>Three of the four have adjustable triggers with little tabs in the blades to prevent unintended discharges; the lone exception is the Axis. (This is a little strange, since Savage’s Accu-Trigger introduced the concept to American rifle shooters.) The Ruger and Savage have tang safeties, while the Remington and Mossberg have safety levers on the right side of the tang. In fact the Mossberg’s action looks a lot like a Remington Model 700, and it’s the only rifle of the four to have a blind magazine. The other three use detachable-box magazines partly made of polymer, though in the Remington polymer parts are combined with sheet steel.</p><p>The Mossberg, Remington and Savage all have separate recoil lugs between the barrel and the front of the action, and all four rifles use lock-nuts to attach the barrels, a faster and, thus, less expensive way to set headspace. None of the actions are controlled-round feed, so hunters will have to take their chances against deer and elk that decide to charge. All four have “plastic” trigger guards (on the Mossberg and Ruger they are integrally molded with the stock), soft recoil pads and sling-swivel studs.</p><p>In the 1950s, believe it or not, only more expensive rifles came with recoil pads and sling swivels, and you had to pay a gunsmith to install them or do it yourself-which explains the lopsided recoil pads and off-center sling-swivels on many “classic” factory rifles. Of course, on two of the four 21st-century affordable rifles the studs are injection-molded along with the stock, but the Remington and Ruger have genuine steel studs. These may well qualify them as classics in 2064.</p><p>In fact, all four rifles have more from-the-factory features than the typical “affordable” bolt-action hunting rifles of half a century ago, and better trigger pulls than the average factory rifle of any price 25 years ago. They shoot reasonably accurately to really well with the right ammunition, and none of them malfunctioned in any way during the testing. Considering inflation since 1950, they all cost considerably less than the Remington 721/722 did, so they really are “valued priced,” something we should all value when trying to involve more kids in hunting and shooting sports.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bargain-bolt-actions.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-33718" title="bargain bolt actions" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bargain-bolt-actions.jpg" alt="bargain bolt actions" width="700" height="145" /></a></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Chiappa M9-22]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Chiappa is an Italian firm that specializes in replica firearms. Founded in 1958 by Ezechile Chiappa, the name is now an umbrella for several brands, including Armi Sport and Kimar. Chiappa’s M9-22 is made under the Kimar brand, labeled Chiappa and distributed by the U.S. firm MKS Supply. Visually it’s a Beretta 92FS, but with changes necessary for it to function as a rimfire, and it comes at a cost of around $300. It’s available in a wood- or plastic-stocked Standard model, and the plastic-stocked Tactical model with Novak-style sights and a threaded barrel.</p><p>Both models exhibit the same profile, controls, and double-action/single-action trigger as the original, but use a frame cast from a zinc alloy the company refers to as Chiappalloy. Both the process and material are sufficient for the lower pressures of the .22 Long Rifle cartridge. The gun’s 37-ounce weight is surprising, given its chambering. It’s not until wallets are weighed that the M9-22 regains its charm.</p><p>Chiappa calls its action a “fixed barrel blow-back” system. Its 51⁄8-inch barrel sleeve is cast as an integral part of the frame, complete with the feed ramp. A steel barrel insert is rifled with a 1:16-inch twist, and it’s fitted into the sleeve then secured with a set screw. The gun’s recoil spring guide rod looks rather fragile; it contains two holes in each end, the forward of which assists in assembly.</p><p>The Chiappa’s magazine release, slide release lever, decocker/manual safety, hammer, and take down lever all function like its center-fire brethren, except the decocker/manual safety and the sights are made of plastic rather than metal. Its 10-round magazine is made from plastic, save the spring, and weighs 1.5 ounces. We appreciated that it falls free of the magazine well when released.</p><p>The decocker/manual safety system is a proven one. Safely drop the hammer by rolling the ambidextrous decocking lever down. This movement disconnects and shields the firing pin by rolling it up and out of the path of the hammer. With the lever and therefore the hammer in the down position-the safe position-the trigger can still be pulled in double-action mode, thereby cocking and dropping the hammer, without the possibility of firing. If the gun is dropped accidentally, the firing pin block prevents it from reaching the primer unless the trigger is pulled. To fire, rotate the decocking/manual safety up, then either pull the trigger in double-action mode, or manually cock the hammer to fire the first round in single-action mode. Despite the decocker/safety being made of plastic, it functions fine.</p><p>The M9-.22’s trigger is a replica of the original and for that reason it is a great source of love or loathe to individual shooters. It uses a reliable system that creates cocking leverage by pulling an external, sliding trigger bar that engages the hammer when the slide is installed. Trigger pressure cocks the hammer before pushing the sear disconnect forward to release it. The double-action trigger pull measured slightly more than 12 pounds-so stout some petite shooters couldn't pull it. The trigger’s single-action pull weight measured 5 pounds, 8 ounces and had a slight bit of creep.</p><p>The steel extractor is mounted in the right side of the slide. The ejector is integral with the magazine; as the extractor pulls the case back the case rim scrapes by the magazine and ejects it. One big advantage of the open-slide design of the M9 is that jams or misfires-common to .22 Long Rifles-are reduced thanks to ample ejection port clearance. Jams that do occur are easily cleared.</p><p>The stocks are made of plastic or wood, although the wood panels make the gun’s grip 1/4 inch thicker than the plastic ones. It should be noted that this pistol’s grip frame is oversized already: The minimum measurement between the trigger and the backstrap is 2.92 inches.</p><p>At the range, the M9-22 demanded a break-in period of 200 rounds before it began to function reliably. Prior to that it would shoot, eject the spent case, send a fresh round into battery, but fail to re-cock the hammer. The frequency of the malfunction occurred less as the gun was fired, but it happened 34 times in 500 rounds. Low-recoiling Remington CBee rounds would not cycle, and it was very sensitive to hand pressure on the slide. After break-in, the M9-22 became pleasurable to shoot and  proved to be accurate.</p><p>Out of the box the Chiappa shot consistently high and left. Windage was adjusted by loosening a set screw on the rear sight before drifting. Elevation, however, must be zeroed by filing the fixed plastic front sight. Both are matte-black just like the rest of the firearm.</p><p>After shooting, the gun appeared as though it was much more harshly used than it had been, no thanks to its finish that scrapes away when making contact with harder surfaces. A line on the barrel was etched by the slide. Even given the pistol's low price, Chiappa could do a better job in that regard.</p><p>Disassembly is trickier than with the original. With the takedown latch rotated and removed and the hammer hyperextended with the provided key, the slide can be pulled rearward and off the frame. During reassembly, use the key to pin the guide rod to the slide by inserting it in the guide rod’s forward hole. Then move the slide forward, taking the guide rod with it, exposing the hole in the frame to reinsert the takedown latch.</p><p>The M9-22 is an inexpensive firearm meant for low-cost fun and realistic practice-especially if you’re a fan of the Beretta.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/chiappa.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-33632" title="chiappa" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/chiappa.jpg" alt="chiappa" width="650" height="339" /></a></p><p><a href="http://mkssupply.com" target="_blank"><strong>Chiappa M9-22 Standard</strong></a></p><p><strong>Distributor:</strong> MKS Supply; 8611-A N.Dixie Drive, Dayton, OH 45414; (877) 425-4867</p><p><strong>Caliber:</strong> .22 Long Rifle</p><p><strong>Action Type:</strong> semi-automatic, fixed-barrel, blowback-operated rimfire handgun</p><p><strong>Frame:</strong> cast zinc alloy</p><p><strong>Barrel:</strong> 5" cast sleeve with steel insert</p><p><strong>Rifling</strong>: six-groove, 1:16" RH twist</p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> fixed blade front sight, windage adjustable square notch rear</p><p><strong>Trigger:</strong> double-action, 12-lb., 8-oz. pull; single-action, 5-lb., 5-oz. pull</p><p><strong>Stocks:</strong> plastic or wood</p><p><strong>Overall Length:</strong> 8.65"</p><p><strong>Height:</strong> 5.74"</p><p><strong>Width:</strong> 1.14" (slide); 1.47" (grip)</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 37 ozs.</p><p><strong>Accessories:</strong> extra 10-round magazine, plastic case, brush, owner’s manual</p><p><strong>Suggested Retail Price:</strong> $311 (plastic stocks); $338 (wood stocks)</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/chiappa3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-33634" title="Exploded View" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/chiappa3.jpg" alt="Exploded View" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>]]></bodyContent>

The man then reportedly exited his vehicle carrying a metal baron and approached the vehicle ahead of him yelling violent threats. The driver of the car in front the enraged man feared for his safety and drew his pistol. Police officers intervened and arrested the irate man wielding the baton.

              <title><![CDATA[Testing The Army’s M855A1 Standard Ball Cartridge]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Army replaced its green-tipped 5.56x45 mm NATO, M855 standard ball cartridge in June 2010 with the lead-free, or “green,” M855A1 cartridge. Like its predecessor, the new bullet weighs 62 grains, but since its copper core is one-third lighter than lead, it is approximately 1/8 inch longer. As such, the bullet is seated deeper (and the propellant compressed) to achieve an identical cartridge overall length of 2.248 inches.</p><p>The cartridge’s tip is bronze-colored, which is actually an anti-corrosive coating on its hardened steel penetrator. Unlike that of the M855, the M855A1’s arrowhead-shaped penetrator extends 0.275 inches beyond the front of the gilding metal jacket and, being longer, protrudes deeper inside, where a mechanical lock (i.e. cannelure) secures it. The latter is commonplace on many new non-bonded personal-protection handgun bullets.</p><p>The propellant is temperature-stabilized St. Mark’s SMP842, with additives to reduce muzzle flash and copper fouling in the bore. Its No. 41 primer is identical to the M855’s, but uses a stab crimp rather than the common circumferential crimp, apparently to better withstand the new load’s higher chamber pressure.</p><p><strong>Zeroing, Accuracy and Twist-Rate</strong></p><p>This cartridge has generated considerable interest because of its non-lead, “green” bullet. Sufficient M855A1 cartridges were obtained to compare performance to the previous M855 variant, and to measure any improvements, differences or deviations. The tests employed Colt, Remington and Smith &amp; Wesson flattop ARs, having 1:7- and 1:9-inch twist rates, with both 16-inch standard and 24-inch match-grade barrels. Each rifle was topped by a high-magnification scope to allow precise aiming and target definition.</p><p>One initial U.S. Army claim, that when switching to the new round shooters were, “Not required to re-zero,” was immediately disproven. At 100 yards, there was a 3-inch zero shift with M855A1; a shooter must re-zero his rifle or carbine when transitioning from M855 to the new cartridge. The Army’s Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) recently modified that guidance, asserting that it, “lessens the need to re-zero the weapon.”</p><p>Accuracy cannot be assessed without addressing the rifle barrels’ twist-rates. In the early 1980s the M855’s 62-grain bullet was developed for the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW). For purposes of interoperability, the same load was adopted as the M16A2 rifle’s standard ball as well. A February 1986 U.S. Army study noted that the M855’s bullet required a “1:9 twist [which] would be more appropriate for the M16A2 rifle, improving accuracy and reliability.” Multiple studies confirmed the 1:9-inch twist requirement.</p><p>But then a problem arose. The U.S. military’s standard M856 5.56 mm tracer round was longer, heavier (63.7 grains) and slower than the M855 ball, and simply would not stabilize with a 1:9-inch twist barrel. Thus, despite it doubling M855 group sizes, the M16A2 (and later, the M4) specified a 1:7-inch rate-of-twist barrel to stabilize the tracer round. It remains so to this day. Therefore, M855A1 was test-fired with both 1:7- and 1:9-inch twist barrels, and it was verified that this new cartridge is consistently more accurate in the latter barrels-as was its predecessor.</p><p>The M855A1’s developers have described it as yielding “match-like” accuracy, which most rifle shooters would define as one minute-of-angle (m.o.a.), or groups measuring no more than 1 inch at 100 yards. While the new ammunition has proved more accurate than the green-tipped load it replaced, testing did not yield match-like accuracy, especially in the standard 1:7-inch twist-rate found in today’s M4s and M16s. At 100 yards, the best group with a 1:7-inch barrel was 1.62 inches (1.6 m.o.a.). At 300 yards. it similarly fired 1.6 m.o.a. (4.9 inches) and widened to 1.8 m.o.a. (7.5 inches) at 400 yards. At these same distances, firing the M855A1 through a 1:9-inch twist barrel reduced group sizes by approximately half.</p><p>On average, the new ammunition produced one flyer in roughly each five rounds, which, it can be argued, exaggerated the group sizes. Since the Army announced that, “On average, 95 percent of the [M855A1] rounds will hit an 8x8-inch target at 600 meters,” each group’s most errant bullet impact was discarded and group sizes recalculated. Statistically they improved, but not enough to place 95 percent of rounds so close at 600 meters, at least when using the standard 1:7-inch barrel-which may explain why accuracy was less than expected.</p><p>When U.S. Army shooters twice fired public demonstrations of the new round, they did not employ standard 1:7-inch twist M16A2s or M4s, but accurized, match-grade, stainless-barreled rifles from the Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU). I contacted the AMU and learned that these rifles did not have standard-issue 1:7-inch barrels, but most likely 1:8-inch twist, which probably accounts for their “match-like” accuracy.</p><p>Further analyzing the new cartridge, 10 bullets were pulled to measure their weight. Seven<a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/compare.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-33731" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="As it lacks lead, the new M855A1 “green” bullet (r.) is considerably longer than its M855 counterpart (l.)." src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/compare-300x280.jpg" alt="As it lacks lead, the new M855A1 “green” bullet (r.) is considerably longer than its M855 counterpart (l.)." width="300" height="280" /></a> bullets weighed within 0.2 grain of 62 grains-a tolerance worthy of match-grade projectiles-while the average for all 10 was an impressive 61.99 grains. However, while using an impact puller there was a great variation in the number of blows required to release a bullet; some popped out with only four strikes while others required more than 40. This was most likely attributed to an inconsistent application of the bullet’s waterproof seal, inducing unbalanced separation of the bullet from the cartridge mouth. This could well account for the flyers experienced.</p><p>Interestingly, while inspecting the M855A1 cartridges, it was noted that 18 percent of the exposed penetrators rotated with finger-pressure. However, testing those cartridges separately, they proved to be no less accurate than the others.</p><p>Overall, it was found that M855A1 is more accurate than the old green-tip, but capable of even better accuracy when fired from a 1:9-inch twist barrel.</p><p><strong>Lethality</strong></p><p>Recent combat experiences identified the green-tipped M855’s tendency to occasionally “ice-pick”-that is, poke completely through enemy personnel without neutralizing them-even with multiple hits, especially during close-range gunfights. Sometimes it performed well; sometimes it did not.</p><p>Army researchers found that lethality was dictated by the 5.56 mm bullet’s yaw; that is, after impact a hardened ball projectile must wobble or turn against its axis-yaw-or fragment, to inflict significant tissue damage. “At a low angle of yaw,” an Army study determined, “the bullet reacts more slowly, causing the inconsistent effects observed in the field … . [T]he location and amount of yaw depend upon the speed of the bullet at impact, angle of impact, and density of tissue.”</p><p>A related factor was the physiology of Afghan Taliban and Iraqi insurgents. Usually malnourished, their torsos are only about 7.5-inches thick, while the older M855 projectile often penetrated, “up to 7 inches before beginning to yaw, and will already have exited the body before yaw or fragmentation occur.” According to published standards, the new cartridge is designed to yaw no more than 3 inches beyond the impact point, producing a temporary cavity diameter of 4 to 6 inches and minimum penetration depth of 12 inches, and to do that consistently.</p><p>To test those standards, the Black Hills Ammunition ballistics lab assisted me by test-firing the M855A1 into ballistic gelatin. In particular, I was interested in the bullet’s performance at close-quarters so it was fired at 12 feet, a distance at which the old round sometimes failed. The results were impressive. In less than 1inch the lead-free bullet yawed, immediately opening a 4.5-inch wide temporary cavity, which extended for 14.5 inches-exactly as claimed. That would certainly be effective against the thin-torsoed insurgents operating in the Mideast and Southwest Asia.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Comparison-Chart.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-33733" title="Comparison Chart" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Comparison-Chart.jpg" alt="Comparison Chart" width="750" height="420" /></a></p><p><strong>Barrier Penetration</strong></p><p>This is where the M855A1 excels. Unlike the older bullet, the M855A1’s penetrator is exposed, with a sharper tip, and it weighs 19 grains, nearly twice the weight of the M855’s penetrator. And the new bullet is also pushed at a higher velocity.</p><p>Fired from the M4’s 14.5-inch barrel, the penetrator can pierce 3/8 inches hardened steel at 350 meters, “based on the range at which 50 percent of the rounds will pass through the barrier.” That’s more than twice as far as the earlier green-tipped cartridge’s bullet and that distance is extended even farther when it is fired from the M16A2’s 20-inch barrel. To test those claims, both were first fired into a hardened, 3/8-inch steel plate at 100 yards; the old M855’s penetrator did not penetrate, leaving only a silver crater. The new bronze-tipped penetrator punched completely through. Next, the green-tip and bronze-tip bullets were fired at 3/8-inch soft steel at 300 yards. Again, the new bullet punched cleanly through, while the green-tipped M855 merely left a surface smear.</p><p>According to the Army, the new bullet also penetrates concrete blocks at 90 yards when fired from an M16A2’s 20-inch barrel, and at 40 yards when fired from an M4’s shorter barrel. A single green-tip projectile could not breach a concrete block at any distance.</p><p>Because there were reported instances in Iraq of the older bullet failing to penetrate car doors or inflict serious wounds when fired into windshields, the new bullet was also tested according to FBI criteria against those prescribed barriers, including sheet steel and automobile glass. Not only did the M855A1 breach them, but it continued on into ballistic gelatin with sufficient weight and velocity to have inflicted serious or lethal wounds.</p><p>One unforeseen consequence of such excellent barrier penetration: Army sources tell me the M855A1 is chewing up expensive target stands, while its steel penetrator sometimes ricochets beyond established impact areas. Those issues are now being studied.</p><p><strong>Matching The M855’s Trajectory</strong></p><p>During the past decade the U.S. Army and Marine Corps has purchased thousands of <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Penny-Comparison.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-33737" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="Penny Comparison" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Penny-Comparison-300x273.jpg" alt="Penny Comparison" width="300" height="273" /></a>optical sights-especially ACOGs-that incorporate holdover lines calibrated to the old M855 bullet’s trajectory. Having invested millions of dollars in the advanced sights, the M855A1 was intended to be a “ballistic match” to the previous cartridge to preclude expensive sight modifications.</p><p>Since the new bullet is longer and faster with a sharper tip and higher ballistic coefficient, one could expect to find some trajectory variance. Instead of relying on computer-generated trajectory graphs, the M855’s drop was live-fire tested against that of the M855A1 through a 1:7-inch twist barrel.</p><p>Beginning with a 100-yard zero, five-round groups of each cartridge were fired at 200, 300 and 400 yards, and then measured bullet drop from center-group to center-group. At 200 yards, the groups printed atop each other-a true trajectory match. At 300 yards, the faster new round’s group printed 6 inches higher than the old green-tip, which I consider to be a significant variance. At 400 yards, the groups began to converge, with the new ammunition impacting 4.5-inches high.</p><p>How acceptable are these variances? That depends on how precisely a combat soldier is expected to shoot at medium-range.</p><p><strong>Propellant, Chamber Pressure, Barrel Length and Muzzle Velocity</strong></p><p>The new M855A1 contains St. Mark’s SMP842 propellant, which has been temperature-stabilized to minimize the effects of heat and cold on burning rates. Also, a bore de-coppering agent was added to mitigate the effects of jacket fouling from the new projectile. Yet another additive reduces muzzle flash, which is helpful when the new cartridge is fired from short-barreled M4s.</p><p>Muzzle velocity was boosted to improve lethality, especially at close range when fired from M4 carbines. Thus, at 120 meters the M4’s 14.5-inch barrel still yields 2476 f.p.s. velocity; and even from the SEAL 10-inch barreled M4 it attains 2214 f.p.s. The downside of the new propellant formulation is, unfortunately, a commensurate increase in chamber pressure, which eventually will affect a rifle’s performance.</p><p>In 1984, the USMC conducted a test comparing the Vietnam-era, 55-grain, M193 round to the then-new 62-grain, green-tipped M855, which had boosted chamber pressure from 50,000 p.s.i. to 53,000 p.s.i. Side-by-side, 6,000 rounds each were fired through M16A1s and M16A2s with the green-tip’s hotter load. While the M16A1s saw virtually no accuracy decline, the M16A2s saw their groups more than double in size-the sole variable was chamber pressure. And the new cartridge generates even greater pressure, perhaps 3,000 to 5,000 p.s.i.</p><p>For gas port pressure, the M855A1 generates 50 percent higher pressure (23,767 p.s.i.) <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/120317-A-NQ379-041.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-33741" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="Dept. of Defense photo by U.S. Army S/Sgt. Jason Epperson " src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/120317-A-NQ379-041-241x300.jpg" alt="Dept. of Defense photo by U.S. Army S/Sgt. Jason Epperson " width="241" height="300" /></a>on the Special Ops 11.5-inch M4 barrel, compared to the 16,067 p.s.i. with the M16A2’s 20-inch barrel. That has been shown to cause port erosion, which boosts the automatic-fire rate, increasing the likelihood of jams. In the 2011 tests of new Army carbine prototypes, the barrels experienced “accelerated bolt wear” from firing the M855A1, because of higher chamber pressure and increased bore temperatures. A Special Operations Command test saw cracks appear on locking lugs and bolts at the cam pin holes on average at 6,000 rounds, but with as few as 3,000 rounds of “intense” full-automatic firing. The solution may be to find a means to count the number of rounds a rifle has fired.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Despite some shortcomings, the M855A1 is probably the world’s best 5.56 mm ball ammunition and a significant improvement over the green-tipped M855 cartridge. The M855A1 enhances the M4’s and M16A2’s lethality, boosts barrier penetration, and is more accurate than the old M855. Its lead-free composition breaks new ground for American military ammunition; however, it does not increase the 5.56 mm’s effective range. Only a totally new cartridge can accomplish that.</p><p><strong>Why the Controversy?</strong></p><p>Whenever the U.S. Army adopts a new rifle or cartridge it generates controversy, which was as true in the days of John Garand’s M1 and Colt’s 5.56 mm AR-15 as it is today. The Army’s recent fielding of a lead-free 5.56 mm standard ball cartridge is no exception, but it was exacerbated by how the new cartridge was promoted during development.</p><p>Various Army institutions initially emphasized the bullet’s environmental impact with no stated goal of improving the 5.56 mm’s performance. This program aspired solely, “to annually eliminate 2000 metric tons of hazardous material,” and that, alone. Army reports abound with terms such as “environmentally friendly,” and, “the Army’s commitment to environmental stewardship.” The M855A1’s development was even called a “moral obligation” in the Army’s 2010 Life Cycle Environmental Assessment.</p><p>Accuracy was not an issue until well into the cartridge’s final development. Despite America’s military forces being seven years into war, a 2008 PowerPoint briefing listed the M855A1’s first consideration as “Environmental Compliance,” while “Accuracy” merely followed. And then, when the new M855A1’s accuracy specifications were published, they were the same as the old M855 it replaced-a “standard deviation of 6.8 inches at 600 yards”-meaning at least half the bullets must impact within 6.8 inches of the point-of-aim. That was quite at odds with, “match-like accuracy.”</p><p>A civilian Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU) shooter demonstrated the M855A1’s accuracy at the NRA’s 2012 Camp Perry National Matches. He did not fire a standard M4 or M16A2 with a 1:7-inch twist barrel, however, but instead shot a match-grade rifle with a stainless barrel and a more accurate 1:8-inch twist. Thus, the demonstration proved nothing. Likewise, another Army demonstration pitted the old M855 fired by a standard M4 Carbine against the new M855A1 fired by an AMU match-grade rifle, and again, any results were skewed by different barrel-twist rates.</p><p>As late as 2005, the developers’ goal was to “at least match” the M855’s performance, which was already considered deficient due to well documented inadequacies in Iraq and Afghanistan. And then, when the new bullet’s ballistic gelatin tests were completed, the Army classified the results. “What’s so secret?” a firearm industry expert asked me. “It’s just ball ammunition.” One Army officer wrote that the classification was, “so the process does not lend itself to adoption by commercial entities.” However, a Picatinny Arsenal representative told me it was classified, “to preserve our technological advantages over our potential adversaries.”</p><p>Performance assertions were skewed, too. While developers hailed the new bullet as “vastly better” at penetrating steel than the 7.62 mm, M80 ball round, this was an apples-to-oranges comparison. The M855A1 has a steel penetrator-it should penetrate better than a 7.62 mm ball round, which contains a lead-alloy core. Similarly, it was misleading for the Army Research Laboratory to have tested the round, “against 24 layers of Kevlar fabric out to 1,000 meters.” That thickness of Kevlar is only rated to protect its wearers against handgun ammunition-not rifle ammunition-and especially not a rifle round with a steel penetrator. Such a claim was both irrelevant and disingenuous.</p><p>Despite all the “spin”-as testing revealed-the M855A1 is more accurate, more lethal and offers better barrier penetration than its predecessor. That’s what’s important to the soldiers and Marines whose lives are on the line. There was no need to exaggerate.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Performance.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-33734" title="Performance" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Performance.jpg" alt="Performance" width="600" height="504" /></a></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Smart Guns: Betting Your Life on Your iPhone?]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><em>The NRA Firearms Sourcebook</em> defines a firearm as “An assembly of a barrel and action from which a projectile is propelled through a deflagration of propellant.” I love that word: deflagration. Webster’s defines to deflagrate as “to burn down” or “to burn rapidly with intense heat and sparks being given off.” Every time a cartridge gun is fired there is a detonation of a primer followed by the conversion of solid propellant (gunpowder) to an expanding gas that drives a projectile (or projectiles in the case of shotshells) down the barrel. The consequences of the chemical reaction of turning solid propellant into gas results are heat and recoil.  It is hot and violent. Deflegration is not a place where I want my iPhone. I have enough trouble getting mine to read a thumbprint after eating a hamburger, let alone the stressful circumstances that might occur when I would actually need to use a firearm defensively.</p><p>But technology similar to that used to unlock your iPhone is one of the approaches makers of so-called “smart guns” have taken toward personalizing firearms. There is nothing wrong with efforts to produce personalized firearms. If firearm owners want such devices, then the market will supply them. Given the option of purchasing a personalized firearm and consumers will eventually decide whether or not it is a viable business. The problem is when misguided legislators mandate unproven technology that has not been tested by third parties or even entered production.</p><p>But there needs to be education as to what such designs do or do not do-and a full understanding of the limitations imposed by piling on additional steps necessary to use a firearm, particularly in a self-defense situation. In nations such as Germany and Ireland, where two of the more vociferous would-be purveyors of so-called “smart gun” designs originate, there is no contemporary culture of self-defense. Simply put, they are thinking of target shooters or police as potential markets, not armed citizens responsible for their own personal protection.</p><p>Why do most U.S. law enforcement agencies use a form of striker-fired or trigger-cocking handgun without an external manual safety? Because, under stress, officers often forget to disengage them. Thus, the rise of Glock and other similar pistols. If you think a manual safety is hard to figure out under duress, try a fingerprint reader.</p><p>While I addressed potential issues <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blogs/smart--guns-dude-you-hacked-my-gun" target="_blank">Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) in a previous blog</a>, here I would like to dig a little deeper on fingerprint identification. Many of us use them all the time on our phones or to gain access to a secure facility. A scanner on your phone or at the entrance to a tech lab is a long way from deflagration.</p><p>In doing a quick search for “fingerpint phone failures” I found this little tidbit on a forum that should be extremely helpful for a homeowner having trouble with their gun-mounted fingerprint reader when something goes bump in the night: “For those experiencing Touch ID issues that cause their phone to freeze, or to not work as well over time, restarting the phone or recalibrating the sensor are your best bets.”</p><p>Restarting? Recalibrating? Not things that can be done quickly or under stress.</p><p>The fingerprint reader is a form of biometric technology. The reader, typically a capacitive sensor, scans your fingerprint, stores it and then uses it to compare against later images. If the reader gets a match, you can use your phone. If it doesn’t, well, you can’t. Kind of like an electronic version of a slot machine matching three cherries for a big payout-but with literally billions of permutations.</p><p>Fingerprints, of course, are unique, and once stored, the device uses algorithms to compare the swishes, swirls, valleys, etc., against the data captured or encoded initially. The better the initial image, the more successful subsequent comparisons will be. Essentially, the device matches the initial image (or images) entered into it. It is comparing a data file representing the fingerprint against another file of a new image every time your finger hits the sensor. The size of the reader makes a difference; the bigger the better.</p><p>Also capacitive sensors are usually of a thin fragile material and must be protected by a screen. Scratch the screen, and you can’t obtain a good reading. And remember those algorithms? It takes time to process? How quickly, it depends on the speed of the processor and how good an image the sensor gets.</p><p>Speaking of how good an image, the ridges and valleys of your fingerprints can be clogged by dirt, mud or, worse, blood, preventing a clear match. And if your fingerprints are too dry or too oily, again, it slows down or will not give a match. And capacitors can wear out. If it’s good for 10,000 swipes, what happens at 10,001? What effect does the violence and heat of a firearm discharging have on the reader? We simply don’t know yet.</p><p>And then there is a question of what, say, <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13207&amp;cat=3&amp;sub=4" target="_blank">Hoppe’s No. 9</a> will do to your fingerprint scanner. Will it eat the glue around the cover and then the silicon capacitor underneath?</p><p>There are times I want to subject my phone to deflagratation, but I have no expectation it would work if I used Gorilla Glue to attach it to my H&amp;K USP Compact in .40 S&amp;W for 10,000 rounds.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Too Valuable for the Safe]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>An abused J. Stevens single-shot, break-open 12-gauge holds of place of honor today, and receives more attention than the SIG Sauer M400, Beretta Storm Carbine, Kimber 84 and Remington 700 that share the vault. I knew it could never be, but somehow I&rsquo;d hoped it would always be with Dad, proudly hanging on the den wall like it did when I was growing up, visually teasing friends until they&rsquo;d finally inquire about the old gun and sit hypnotized as my father shared hunting tales from the Great Depression. </p><p>Wall-hanging legacies like this have, unfortunately, been replaced by wide-screen TVs and even those deadly accurate Mayan calendars. Part of the reason is the perceived safety issue. Parents are encouraged to inquire about firearms before their child ever steps inside a friend&rsquo;s house, yet the same &ldquo;child welfare&rdquo; groups don&rsquo;t address pools and pets, much likelier suspects in regard to injuries. </p><p>My father&rsquo;s approach, like many gun-owning parents at the time, was dirt simple and eloquent. That shotgun was displayed proudly and unloaded. Cleaning the den meant we checked again that the chamber was empty. Ammunition was stored in a separate room and as a result any time one of my young friends asked about it, the gun came down, where they witnessed all the safety precautions and saw how to open the barrel and ensure there was no shotshell inside. Only then did his tales begin. </p><p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure how it worked, but it did. There was no mystique, I never once touched it without an adult present and it was the same with my friends. </p><p>Even back then there were anti-gun sentiments, though, and there was a single &ldquo;inspection&rdquo; from my best friend&rsquo;s parents. They were deeply religious and highly anti-gun (which are not mutually exclusive terms), but open-minded enough that their son hunted with us for 10 years afterward. </p><p>Things don&rsquo;t go as well today if the anti-gun Gestapo shows up at your door. &ldquo;Little Billy said you have guns in the house and that one of them isn&rsquo;t locked up. Is that true?&rdquo; </p><p>It&rsquo;s a trick question. At this point you know the snotty-nosed kid&rsquo;s claim he&rsquo;d gotten lost on the way to the bathroom was to buy time to inventory most of the house with his iPhone, put the photos on Facebook to summon reinforcements for his parents, alert the social-media-monitoring school and cement his chances of winning a third student-of-the-year award.</p><p>&ldquo;I messaged the parents of some of his friends, and they confirmed their children have seen a gun here.&rdquo; The message is cryptic, but it roughly translates to, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen to it that no one in the neighborhood is going to speak to you or your family again, the pediatrician will be informed tomorrow when I take Billy in for his toe-fungus checkup and your son will no longer be invited to pool parties, soccer leagues or the annual subdivision steeple chase.&rdquo; </p><p>The prospect of confrontations with vocal minorities like Billy&rsquo;s mom is one of the reasons fewer guns&mdash;even non-working family heirlooms&mdash;hang proudly on walls today. I had a similar encounter while going through a child-custody battle long before iPhones dropped from the Mac tree. For a year I was in court more frequently than Fox runs &ldquo;American Idol&rdquo; advertisements. </p><p>Another reason is the fact that today&rsquo;s gun owners are also far more educated and safety conscious. They have to be, with the increase in population, urban migration, designer drugs and even lifestyle-monitoring health-care professionals. The industry has responded to their need for added security and privacy with some great new firearm-security devices that leave them instantly accessible in an emergency. <a href="http://www.gunvault.com" target="_blank">GunVault&rsquo;s</a> fingerprint-recognition system, for example, was the stuff of science fiction when dad was spinning yarns. </p><p>Does that mean proudly displayed guns are an endangered species? Not in my case, anyway. Old Model &rsquo;94s (like the one I&rsquo;ve inherited) aren&rsquo;t much of a collector&rsquo;s item, with tens of thousands of the bargain-priced, utilitarian shotguns produced by the Stevens factory in Chicopee Falls, Ma. Despite the model being discontinued sometime in the 1940s, a new-and-in-the-box specimen fetches only slightly more than $100 according to the latest &ldquo;<a href="http://www.midwayusa.com/product/756500/gun-traders-guide-34th-edition-book-by-stephen-d-carpenteri" target="_blank">Gun Trader&rsquo;s Guide</a>.&rdquo; The specimen I have is in bad shape, though, with a well-worn lockup that has relegated it to wall-hanging duties since the &rsquo;60s. </p><p>My father lost his fight with emphysema in late January, but this scarred shotgun will continue his legacy. When one of the grandkids brings over a friend who inquires, I&rsquo;ll take it out, explain the safety procedures and tell him how my father hunted with it during the Great Depression.</p><p>Some traditions are too important to lock up, so long as they&rsquo;re celebrated safely. <br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Perishable Skills]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>Many don&rsquo;t realize it, but shooting is a perishable skill that must be continuously renewed through practice and training. Every expert recommends regular range time to both improve and maintain accuracy and the skills needed to ward off a deadly attack. This is constantly proven by the thousands of rounds fired every year by competitors to stay at the top of their fields. </p><p>While most of us can&rsquo;t afford the money or time to fire that number of rounds, regular range time is needed to ensure that muscle memory stays at current levels, and even more to improve on those skills. In addition, it is important to learn your carry gun, as firearms, while similar in many regards, are not all the same with controls located in different locations and working in different ways; a 1911 safety lever is disengaged by pressing it down while the safety on a Beretta 92 must be moved up before firing. </p><p>Even if time is an issue, or lack of ammunition, dry fire practice, with or without a training laser, is better than nothing and can be done almost anywhere. On a regular basis, I unload my <a href="http://www.kimberamerica.com/" target="_blank">Kimber</a>, stand in front of a mirror and practice drawing and firing. Also, whenever I swap guns or carry methods, whether for testing purposes or because I just want to carry something different, I spend a few minutes locking the muscle memory in my mind for that day. I don&rsquo;t ever want to reach for my gun because of a situation to discover that it is somewhere else, which could cause me to lose precious seconds, and change the desired outcome. </p><p>Life is busy. With two youngsters clamoring for my time, I&rsquo;m well aware that heading to the range for training is sometimes difficult. However, since part of my job as a father, husband and honest citizen is ensuring that my skills are up to the task, I make time for both dry- and live-fire practice. You should too. <br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Paul Ohle, 69, was at home baking around 9 a.m. when he heard more than a dozen bangs on his front door. By the time he made it to the door, a man had already forced his way inside. The man told Ohle that he needed help, so Ohle picked up his cell phone to call 911. The man grabbed the phone from Ohle and pushed him onto the sofa. He ordered Ohle to stay where he was as he tried to take his television. Ohle struggled with the man, but managed to get to the .38-cal. handgun he kept in his bedroom. Ohle fired multiple rounds, killing the intruder. Ohle was later taken to an area hospital where he was treated and released.

Spokane police said the 63-year-old woman fired one shot at the man when she found him in her home around 12:20 a.m. but he was not injured. "I just woke up with the crash and grabbed my gun and got out of bed and said 'I'm armed' and he kept coming at me," the homeowner said. "I shot off one round and he kept coming, so I started backing up." The intruder "flopped" on her sofa, she said, and she got the phone and called 911. When police arrived the intruder attempted to flee, but went back in the house upon seeing officers. Police entered the home where the intruder resisted, but was finally subdued with help from the K9 unit.

              <title><![CDATA[Machine Pistols]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>There is a variation of the basic pistol that is worthy of a quick look, but is a variation that most of us will never fire, much less own. It&rsquo;s called a machine pistol, which means a full-auto pistol&mdash;illegal without federal registration and tax stamp. Less there be confusion in terminology, understand that the abbreviation MP is sometimes used to describe them, but the Germans use that same abbreviation to describe the submachine gun&mdash;MP38, MP5, etc. In common use, the submachine gun is a compact full-auto firearm that fires pistol cartridges. It has a buttstock for support and is very effective in trained hands. In most cases, submachine guns are not easily concealed. Machine pistols, on the other hand, are full-auto guns firing pistol cartridges and having fairly concealable characteristics. More often than not, they do not have stocks or other support devices. I do not believe the machine pistol has characteristics that make it an effective firearm for anything but highly specialized roles.</p><p>The basic problem with this type of firearm is simple. Pistols light enough to be carried (2 to 3 pounds) produce recoil that raises the gun&rsquo;s muzzle upon firing. Second and subsequent shots only increase the recoil and muzzle rise. Even a short burst usually drives the gun well off target. Much of the time, all but the first shot is a miss. You get much noise with repeated shots, lots of muzzle flash and golden streams of brass in the air, but only an occasional hit. You could slow down the rate of fire with more mass to the recoiling parts or more strength to the recoil spring, but there are limits to this approach. One of more familiar versions of the machine pistol is the C96 Mauser in the later Schnelfeuren version. I fired one of these once and found it tough to manage. My late pal, Chuck Karwan, chuckled when I repeated this story, and commented on the utility of the Spanish Astra copy. The gun&rsquo;s designers worked a rate-of-fire reduction system into the searage, making it much easier to shoot. In handgun history, there have been several machine pistols that have enjoyed modest popularity, such as the Mac-10, Beretta 93R, HK VP70Z and the Russian Steckchin. In prowling around references for these things, I found information on several makers who tried to improve full-auto firing by using less powerful ammo&mdash;.380 Auto, .32 ACP and even .25 ACP.</p><p>As much as the concept seems attractive to modern firepower enthusiasts, it just never went much of anywhere. While they are certainly powerful enough in most versions and the designs are usually acceptable, the guns are so hard to control as to make them impractical. They&rsquo;re ingenious solutions to imaginary problems. However, I did encounter a bit more grudging approval for one model in my casual telephone surveying. Originally conceived as a dignitary protection firearm, the <a href="http://us.glock.com/" target="_blank">Glock</a> G18 can be managed fairly well with practice. They are still made.</p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Where Has All The Ammo Gone, Part Deux]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>I have heard from dozens of NRA members from all over the country about the conditions where they live and seek ammunition. It varies greatly. Some said they are not having trouble, while others said there isn&rsquo;t a single round of .22 Long Rifle within 50 miles of where they live. Some called me a liar&mdash;or worse&mdash;some reported &ldquo;scores&rdquo; or long lines waiting for empty trucks. One guy told me his quest to find ammo is akin to hunting &ldquo;Bigfoot&rdquo;&mdash;and just about as successful.</p><p>While at the <a href="Check out the Annual Meetings blog. ">142nd NRA Annual Meetings &amp; Exhibits</a> in Houston, Texas, I had a chance to speak face-to-face with representatives of the major American ammunition companies. These were guys I know and trust, including some close friends and others I have worked with for more than 20 years. All of them&mdash;I repeat all of them&mdash;reported they have their plants working full out, and are shipping more ammunition than they ever have before. One vice president told me his firm&rsquo;s percentage of Federal law enforcement and military sales is down due to increased production of consumer ammunition. The company is not making less ammunition for the government; it is making more ammunition for consumers. The numbers for government sales are fixed and have been&mdash;and that number is in low single digits of overall production&mdash;but the amount going to the consumer marketplace is up. Way up.</p><p>Another friend from a major ammunition manufacturer told me his company is up 33 percent, and, interestingly, less common or oddball chamberings they customarily only run once a year&mdash;with that inventory being a enough to sustain sales until the next production run the following year&mdash;are running low. Just so you know, DHS does not order 7x57 mm Mauser in quantity. He expressed concern that the company cannot take time to reset the tooling for small runs. And some mid-size and smaller ammo makers are reporting difficulty getting primers, powder and cartridge cases. Just like the average handloader.</p><p>We are still in throes of increased demand, demand that is higher than has ever been seen or even imagined by production forecasters. More ammunition production is reaching distribution channels, but once it gets there, it is purchased. I have been witness to social networking being used to notify friends of local and online in-stock ammunition, at which point the shelves are stripped as if by locusts, locusts with credit cards. </p><p>Just yesterday, I actually found a place that has ammunition. As I was I was filming &ldquo;American Rifleman Television&rdquo; at NRA HQ, I stopped by and saw Mike Johns, who manages the NRA Range in Fairfax, Va., and he told me that when it comes to ammunition, they actually have a lot. Mike planned ahead when he saw the surge coming, and he made sure that they had plenty of the most popular calibers on hand. And he has worked the phones relentlessly to stay stocked. But there are some restrictions. For example, you can&rsquo;t just come and load your flat-bed up with the ammunition from the NRA Range. If you&rsquo;re coming to the NRA Range in Fairfax to shoot, though, they will likely have ammunition for you. It may not be quite as much as you would hope for, but you can still go to the range and shoot. Best of all, the guys at the NRA range are not gouging, they are passing along the relatively increased price the ammunition costs them, obviously, to defray operating costs but it is still reasonably priced. </p><p>Next time I descend the stairs to the NRA Range, I&rsquo;ll ask Mike if Bigfoot has popped by looking for 62-grain 5.56x45 mm NATO.<br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Perfect Practice]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>There is an old saying, repeated often enough to be a clich&eacute;, which says &ldquo;Practice makes Perfect.&rdquo; On the face of it, this might seem to apply to learning the skills of gunhandling and marksmanship. But when you think about the consequences of errors in handling a gun and using it skillfully under stress, then maybe it&rsquo;s time to refine the clich&eacute;&rsquo;d just a little. How about adding a word, making it &ldquo;Perfect Practice makes Perfect?&rdquo; In essence, this simply means that you must execute every aspect of a training regimen to perfection before additional repetitions will produce a beneficial effect. It has been pretty well established that you must do something on the order of 5,000 reps of a physical act before muscle memory takes over and it becomes habit. That&rsquo;s a tall order.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s take something as simple as presenting the pistol from a holster. As taught at <a href="http://www.gunsite.com/main/" target="_blank">Gunsite</a>, this is a five step sequence that begins with the pistol in a holster and ends with the gun locked into a hard Weaver stance, sights aligned on target and finger on the trigger. Students at the school practice the steps of the exercise enough to understand what the steps are. Performed properly, the presentation of the handgun minimizes the movement of the gun. It just comes out of the holster and goes straight to the final on-target position with no wasted motion. With conscientious effort, the presentation is very smooth and can be very quick. Although your initial practice sessions may seem tediously slow, they will become more productive in the long run. </p><p>There are two reasons why it is so vitally important that each step of the sequence be perfectly executed. First, if you vary from the proper technique, you are actually wasting time and effort and won&rsquo;t produce the result that you want. Second, improperly performed steps are simply programing you to perform improperly. You will have to spend even more effort to unlearn the bad stuff. Either way, the practice session achieves nothing of value. Slow it down and go at it just one step at a time. In the case of the presentation drill, you will find that the five (properly performed) steps begin to blend into one another in such a way that it becomes a smooth, swift exercise that brings the gun out and on target quickly. And&mdash;to quote another Gunsite mantra&mdash;Smooth IS Fast.<br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <summaryContent><![CDATA[Thanks to its XD-S in .45 ACP, Springfield Armory was one of the hottest companies of 2012. The XD-S was so innovative that it went on to be named the American Rifleman Handgun of the Year. When you knock one out of the park like that, there's not a lot that needs changing, and Springfield agreed. So, for 2013, Springfield has rolled out an updated version of the XD-S in 9 mm.]]></summaryContent>

              <title><![CDATA[A Bullseye View of Remington's R1 Pistols]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>5/30/2013</em><br /></p><p>American shooters seem to have an unending desire for .45 pistols made on the M1911A1 pattern. Now 102 years old, the grand old pistol continues to enjoy brisk sales, despite a notable lack of so-called &ldquo;modern&rdquo; features&mdash;double-action-only triggers, enhanced-capacity magazines and polymer receivers. This fact is well known and needs little in the way of amplification. Simply stated, the M1911-style pistol is a classic.</p><p>A couple of years ago, the nation&rsquo;s oldest gunmaker took the big step of tooling up to produce the gun for the first time in decades. For the first time in the modern era, you could buy an M1911 in the bright green box associated with <a href="http://www.remington.com/" target="_blank">Remington</a>. While not exactly news at this point in time since the gun was <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/remington-r1-review/" target="_blank">written up in these pages</a>, realize that the last time the Remington name was associated with the M1911 platform was when its lineal predecessor, Remington-Union Metallic Cartridge Co., made M1911 pistols during World War I. This should not be confused with World War II M1911A1s made by an unrelated office machine company named Remington-Rand.</p><p>As of mid-2013, the current Remington firm will have been making its version of the M1911 pistol for about three years. The guns have sold in respectable numbers, so much so that the firm could branch out into the variation market. As much as the American handgunner likes his M1911 model in original G.I. configuration, some prefer one of the many variations of the basic theme that have appeared in the past few years. Obviously, one of the more popular M1911 variants is the abbreviated model with a shorter slide and barrel or a shorter butt&mdash;or both. Big Green has yet to get into this side of things, but it&rsquo;s just getting warmed up. Thus far, the expanded line of Remington&rsquo;s R1 products consists of all 5-inch-barreled models.</p><p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. This is the basic format originally engineered by John Browning, Colt and Army Ordnance. A proven design, the gun has been made all over the world and there are endless variations. The Remington catalog offers&mdash;in addition to the original R1&mdash;a Carry version, a Stainless-steel model and an ornamented Centennial gun. Additionally, there are Enhanced and Enhanced Stainless models, as well as an Enhanced version with threaded barrel. This latter gun incorporates extra-tall sights for use with a screw-on suppressor&mdash;a device more commonly used these days than in the past. This is despite a requirement for NFA registration and purchase of a tax stamp. And finally there is an uncataloged two-tone R1 made for sale through the <a href="http://www.taloinc.com/" target="_blank">TALO</a> Distributor&rsquo;s network of retailers. For this article, I was able to lay hands on three different R1s&mdash;the Standard gun, the TALO special edition and one of the new Carry models. In order to get an idea of the pistols&rsquo; performance, I set out to handle and fire each model under the same set of circumstances. As it happened, this turned out to be a rewarding experience.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s turn our attention first to the basic R1 pistol, which I call the Standard model. An all-blued-steel pistol, the Standard has a combination of features gleaned from both M1911 and M1911A1 G.I. guns. Except for the flat mainspring housing and big dovetailed sights, it is quite like the M1911A1 pistol I was issued for wartime service in Vietnam. Remington prudently varies from that menu of features by including a set of very large sights with three-dot highlights. It also used the flat mainspring housing of M1911 guns, which is usually best for aimed fire. The finish is a modern oxide coating, dead black in color. One of the gun&rsquo;s features that I particularly like is the checkered walnut stocks, made in the original, and I believe, classic double-diamond style. With a vertically serrated flat mainspring housing and characteristic short trigger, as well as thin grip safety, it definitely has the feel of the Government Model .45 pistol. </p><p>As a matter of fact, the TALO pistol is pretty much the same thing, differing from the so-called Standard gun only in the stainless-steel slide. Since Remington also makes a complete stainless R1 .45, it was relatively easy to honor TALO&rsquo;s request for a two-tone pistol. This stylish configuration has gained popularity in the past few years. </p><p>On the other hand, the final pistol in our Remington trio is quite different. Called simply &ldquo;R1 Carry,&rdquo; it has most of the features required by those who plan to carry their .45s on a daily basis. The price is more than the other two models by a good bit&mdash;$1,300 versus $730. But the features of the Carry, long associated with the better custom M1911s, make the package well worth it. To begin with, the Carry comes with genuine <a href="http://www.novaksights.com/" target="_blank">Novak</a> sights. They are the LoMount type featuring a plain black rear and a tritium dot front. This is a popular combination with Novak&rsquo;s customers.With angled cocking serrations and very thorough de-horning of edges and corners&mdash;on both the slide and receiver&mdash;the Carry is holster-ready and designed for snag-free presentation. It&rsquo;s also made to be fired, and a couple more features make shooting easier. </p><p>For one thing, the gun has a wide, upswept beavertail grip safety with checkered insurance pad. Below that, a mainspring housing&mdash;which has been checkered to match&mdash;permits a high and proper grip for fast and accurate firing. On the front of the receiver, there&rsquo;s checkering to match the mainspring housing. A long trigger with three holes and an overtravel stop screw breaks clean at about 4 pounds. Many shooters who actually use M1911-style pistols prefer an ambidextrous safety, so Remington provides one of those. One more practical feature finishes off the cosmetic package. It&rsquo;s a pair of cocobolo stocks with very nice checkering panels angling back and down to the bottom rear of the butt. It is a very appealing specimen of the M1911 breed.</p><p>I fired the guns to develop the accompanying results. The range session involved several hundred rounds of .45 ammunition by the time I finished, and included some Ransom Rest work and a certain amount of informal shooting. In all those rounds, I had exactly one malfunction. It was a failure to chamber. Since it was unusual, I investigated and determined that it was most probably a lack of lubrication. I used a little Rem-Oil and the problem was resolved.</p><p>Adhering to the standard <em>American Rifleman</em> protocol of firing three kinds of ammunition&mdash;in this case the best in .45 ACP that I know of&mdash;I was not disappointed. I first selected two of my standards: <a href="http://www.black-hills.com/" target="_blank">Black Hills</a> 230-grain JHP, one of the most consistently accurate service loads available, and <a href="http://www.federalpremium.com/" target="_blank">Federal</a> Gold Medal 230-grain Match ball, a classic cartridge with decades of service. Finally, I used some of pistolsmith <a href="http://store.chencustom.com/default.asp" target="_blank">Stan Chen&rsquo;s ASYM</a> ammunition in 185-grain SDX form. I have never used this brand before, but Chen has a great reputation for quality, so I gave it a try. </p><p>The accuracy evaluation further followed the <em>Rifleman</em> protocol of shooting five consecutive, five-shot groups at 25 yards. I used a Ransom Rest securely C-clamped to a concrete bench and chronographed using an Oehler Model 35P. With the exception of the previously mentioned low-lube failure to chamber, there were no malfunctions of any kind. In recent years, I have noted a greater degree of reliability with new guns. It has been uncommon to find a pistol&mdash;particularly a full-size model&mdash;that doesn&rsquo;t function out of the box. I guess we&rsquo;re learning to make them correctly.</p><p>I was surprised and impressed with the accuracy of these three Remington .45s. I fired the Standard gun to begin with. It shot groups as small as 0.82 inches (Federal) and averaged 1.89 inches. The TALO Special Edition came next. The two-tone produced a 1.17-inch group and another at 1.29 inches, with an overall average of 2.04 inches. The R1 Carry was the best shooter, with groups as small as 0.52 inches, 0.78 inches and 0.99 inches. The overall, bottom line average of the 45, five-shot groups was 1.81 inches. For box-stock pistols, that is exceptional performance.</p><p>I am at a loss to explain why. I see no interior evidence of hand-fitting on the three specimens (which came from different sources, by the way). Our samples appear to be production guns right from the assembly line. Statisticians will tell you that this is too small a sampling of the R1 population to make definitive statements, but it also suggests that the workers at Remington&rsquo;s Ilion, N.Y., plant are building some fine pistols for American handgunners&mdash;again.</p><p><strong>Manufacturer: </strong>Remington Arms Co., LLC; (800) 243-9700; <a href="http://www.remington.com/" target="_blank">Remington.com</a><br /><strong>Caliber:</strong> .45 ACP<br /><strong>Action Type:</strong> recoil-operated, semi-automatic center-fire pistol<br /><strong>Frame:</strong> steel<br /><strong>Barrel:</strong> 5"<br /><strong>Rifling:</strong> 1:16," LH twist<br /><strong>Magazine:</strong> detachable-box; seven- or eight-round capacity<br /><strong>Sights:</strong> drift adjustable front and rear<br /><strong>Trigger:</strong> 3-lb., 8-oz. to 5-lb. pull<br /><strong>Overall Length:</strong> 8.5"<br /><strong>Width: </strong>1.25"<br /><strong>Height:</strong> 5.5"<br /><strong>Weight:</strong> 38.5 ozs.<br /><strong>Accessories:</strong> lockable hard case, cable lock, manual<br /><strong>Suggested Retail Price:</strong> $730 (1911 R1); $1,300 (1911 R1 Carry)</p><p><img title="Remington R1 Shooting Results Wiley" src="../../Webcontent/gallery/249/2048RemingtonR1ShootingResults.jpg" alt="Remington R1 Shooting Results Wiley" /><br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[The Sheetz Rifle]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>5/30/2013</em><br /></p><p>At New Orleans, the final battle of the War of 1812, riflemen played a crucial role in the crushing British defeat. William Ross and his John Jacob Sheetz-made longrifle&mdash;the only one with such provenance&mdash;were there, and it is an important artifact in the narrative of American freedom. </p><p>William Ross stood looking intently through a dissipating fog over the American breastworks constructed at the behest of Gen. Andrew Jackson. It was Jan. 8, 1815, and the Battle of New Orleans would soon begin. Ross, a family man with five sons and a daughter, was dressed in a blue hunting shirt, belted at the waist and wearing a black slouch hat. The garb identified him as a member of Thomas Beale&rsquo;s Volunteer Riflemen, a local militia group 68 strong, that was formed in mid-December 1814. Most of the men originally hailed from Virginia, but for one reason or another had migrated to New Orleans. Many were prominent businessmen and civic leaders, including Ross, whose occupation was inspecting shipments of flour, which came by the ton into the port of New Orleans. Clutched in his right hand was a long-barreled rifle.</p><p>William Ross would contribute to the American victory that day. The rifle he carried has survived for two centuries and emerged from obscurity to tell the story of its beginnings&mdash;eyewitness to a battle that helped shape and define the United States and its destiny. As of today, it is the only documented, verifiable longrifle that can make that claim.</p><p>The builder of Ross&rsquo; flintlock longrifle was John Jacob Sheetz, 1785-1860. He lived in Shepherdstown, Va., (now West Virginia). John&rsquo;s father, Phillip, and his brother, Martin, were also gunsmiths, known for their excellent workmanship. Phillip apprenticed under George Unkafare of York County, Penn., in 1760 and later taught John the skills needed to build an accurate shooting, artistically decorated longrifle from the ground up; lock, stock and barrel. Today, we refer to William Ross&rsquo; gun as the Sheetz rifle. It is a testimony to the gun building talent of John Jacob Sheetz.</p><p>The longrifle is a uniquely American gun design, borrowing technologies from Germany and other European countries to create a long-barreled, accurate firearm, well adapted to the needs of frontier Americans. Though firearms in this class share many characteristics, such as their long, rifled barrels, individual examples are unique works, heavily influenced not only by the gunsmiths who made them but also by their regions of origin. William Ross&rsquo; longrifle was made in Virginia, and it reflects that in its styling. </p><p>The Sheetz rifle is an excellent example of a flintlock longrifle made in what is known as the Golden Age, the time frame when these guns reached the zenith of their architectural design and artistic development&mdash;loosely from the American Revolution to 1830. The gun is in fine original condition, a repair to the weak sear spring would render it shootable. The .38-cal. wrought-iron barrel has 1:36-inch twist rifling.</p><p>Robert and Linda Melancon, present owners of the Sheetz rifle, provide this description: &ldquo;The gun is in original flint condition, with an original hand-forged lock and marked clearly on the top flat of the 42-inch barrel &lsquo;J. SHEETZ.&rsquo; The wood is curly maple, with fine forestock molding and it retains its original ramrod. There is classic Virginia carving at the rear of the cheekpiece, going from fine incised carving to very subtle raised carving on the large C scroll with a fan design directly to the rear of it. In front of the cheek piece is another C scroll with cross-hatching. The wrist area, behind the barrel tang, carries incised carving of a four-petal flower (identified as edelweiss). The brass patchbox is a typical Virginia style with a finely engraved ... flower finial similar to the wrist carving. Engraved on the patchbox lid is the following inscription: &lsquo;this rifle was used by my father Wm. Ross, member of Capt. Tho. Beale&rsquo;s Company of New Orleans riflemen in defense of N. Orleans. 1814-1815. James Ross 1837&rsquo;.&rdquo; James was William&rsquo;s son and the executor of his will. Curiously, somebody crudely attempted to scratch William Ross&rsquo;s name and the 1837 date off the patchbox lid. No one knows who, when or why.</p><p>The Americans were equipped with around 2,000 longrifles the morning of Jan. 8, 1815. As the British Army under Maj. Gen. Sir Edward Pakenham moved toward Jackson&rsquo;s line around seven o&rsquo;clock, 7,000 of the best equipped and disciplined soldiers in the world marched with determination and resolve through a swampy marshland to crush the Americans under Jackson and capture the port city of New Orleans. If they succeeded, Great Britain would gain control of the Mississippi River, the consequences of which would be dire. England could choke the western commerce of the United States, crippling the economy. Many rivers west of the Allegheny and Appalachian Mountains drained into the Mississippi, creating a watery highway that people used to move their goods and products to New Orleans. Further, the British would certainly pillage and plunder the city, then use its occupation as a powerful bargaining chip for future negotiations with the United States.</p><p>As powerful and successful as any professional army in the world at that time, the British had no reason to think they could fail. For the young United States, the stakes could not have been higher.</p><p>Directly to the right of William Ross, as he was facing the battlefield, flowed the Mississippi River. Earlier, Gen. Jackson ordered that the levee be breached in several places, causing the cold, brown waters of the great river to flood the field of battle, which would prove to be a disadvantage to the British. In front of him, at a short distance, was a hastily assembled brick redoubt with mounted cannon that&mdash;at all costs&mdash;could not fall into the hands of the British army. If captured, the cannon could be turned at an angle to fire down the American line. To his left ran the line of Jackson&rsquo;s breastworks, 1,600-yards long, varying in width up to 20 feet. standing shoulder high and shored up with wooden planking. The last part terminated in a formidable cypress swamp. The Tennessee and Kentucky riflemen were standing four deep in rows the length of their line. Once the man in front discharged his rifle, he would go to the back of his line and reload while the next would step up and fire, and so on. Cannons had been placed on top of cotton bales at intervals along the breastworks. This was Gen. Jackson&rsquo;s idea; he realized the soggy and marshy conditions of the battlefield would be an unstable footing for the firing of cannons, causing accuracy to be erratic and unpredictable. </p><p>In front of the breastworks flowed Rodriguez Canal, about 4-feet deep by 10-feet wide, which ran from the cypress swamp to the Mississippi River. Those two obstacles, the breastworks and canal, would frustrate the British attack. Jackson had chosen his field of battle wisely; the British army would be funneled into an open, soggy field. To breach the American line they would need to march across an open area, ford the canal and use ladders to scale the breastworks where they would be easy targets for the American sharpshooters, such as Beale&rsquo;s Riflemen.</p><p>The American forces were a rich diversity of men including regular troops, volunteers from Louisiana (Beale&rsquo;s riflemen), militiamen from Kentucky and Tennessee, men of color, Baratarians (pirates connected to Jean Lafitte) and even some Choctaw Indians; it was not a polished, professional army. &ldquo;The volunteer Rifle companies in Jackson&rsquo;s line were a sorry sight,&rdquo; wrote author Tim Pickles. &ldquo;Their clothing, which was not a uniform to begin with, had become ruined by long marches. It was from these troops that the British got the idea of calling the Americans &lsquo;the Dirtyshirts.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p><p>The attack began with the British army moving in two columns toward the American line. Major General Samuel Gibb&rsquo;s Second Brigade moved to attack the side opposite from the field Beale&rsquo;s riflemen were protecting; their movements would follow the edge of the cypress swamp. Maj. Gen. John Keane moved the Third Brigade along the river in the general direction of Beale&rsquo;s riflemen, sending some light companies under Col. Robert Rennie to capture the redoubt and turn the cannons back on Jackson&rsquo;s line.</p><p>That is where an important engagement took place that would involve Ross and his rifle. American military engineer Maj. A. Lacarriere Latour gave this eyewitness account: &ldquo;To get into the redoubt was not a very arduous achievement: the difficulty was to maintain possession of it and then clear the breastworks of the entrenchment in the rear of the redoubt, which still remained to be attacked &hellip; Colonel Robert Rennie, followed by two other officers of high rank, had begun to mount the breastwork, when the gallant riflemen under Captain Beale, made them find their graves in the redoubt they had mastered with so much gallantry.&rdquo;</p><p>Had Rennie&rsquo;s men maintained their position on that redoubt next to the river, they would certainly have commandeered the cannons and decimated Jackson&rsquo;s line along the breastwork, probably changing the outcome of the battle. After a clash that lasted less than an hour, the British army suffered one of the most humiliating defeats in its military history, losing more than 2,000 men of its fighting force, including Maj. Gen. Samuel Gibbs and Maj. Gen. Sir Edward Pakenham. The American army suffered 13 dead, 39 wounded and some missing. Many of the British army&rsquo;s casualties had multiple gunshot wounds.</p><p>Ross would earn $23.48 for his tenure of service in Jackson&rsquo;s army serving from Dec. 16, 1814 to March 14, 1815. He died on June 19, 1835, and was buried in Girod Cemetery in New Orleans. The Superdome was later built on the graveyard site. His son James inherited the gun, and in 1837 had the commemorative engraving etched on the patchbox lid. In 1982, Robert and Linda Melancon acquired the rifle from the Royal Street shop of James H. Cohen and Sons, Inc., in New Orleans.</p><p>The victory that Jackson&rsquo;s forces won the morning of Jan. 8, 1815, was more than a tactical one. It helped reunite our nation, restored a sense of national pride and served notice to the world that the United States would staunchly defend its sovereignty. It was an improbable, but smashing victory won with the Sheetz rifle and other American long guns, in the hands of patriots like William Ross, who stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the battle line of New Orleans.</p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><em>5/28/2013</em></p><p>When it comes to protecting its people, no nation is more resolute than Israel. With a land area about the size of New Jersey, and fewer than 8 million citizens, the country is relatively small and geographically vulnerable to the hostile adversaries that surround it. As evidence of its resolve, Israel is said to spend a greater percentage of its gross domestic product on national defense than any other nation.</p><p>With respect to small arms, that commitment has evidenced itself in a raft of designs adopted from other nations-the <a href="http://us.glock.com/" target="_blank">Glock</a> 17 and <a title="Read more about the Browning Hi Power. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/browning-hi-power/" target="_blank">Browning Hi-Power</a> in handguns, the M14 and AK-47 in rifles and the M1919 and M2 Brownings in machine guns to name but a few-and in several domestically produced arms that have become world standards because of their reputation for reliability. Those include the Uzi submachine gun, the Galil rifle, the Negev machine gun and the Tavor, an advanced <a title="The 5.56 is similar to the .223 Rem. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/223-remington-specifics/" target="_blank">5.56x45</a> mm NATO bullpup rifle platform that has been in service with Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) troops for nearly a decade. Having already spun off a range of specialized variants, including some in other chamberings, the Tavor represents the most advanced solution to date employed by Israeli forces fighting a seemingly endless series of urban conflicts.</p><p><strong>Conceived Out Of Conviction</strong></p><p>Officially designated TAR-21, for “Tavor Assault Rifle, 21st century,” the select-fire rifle was named after Israel’s Mount Tabor, which rises, sentinel-like, above the Via Maris roadway in Israel’s lower Galilee region-a route that has held strategic importance since Biblical times.</p><p>The rifle’s development began two decades ago when the Israelis-at the time relying primarily on the Galil and its variants alongside the M16 rifle and M4 carbine for infantry use-found themselves facing increasingly dynamic and demanding urban combat situations. Dismounting from vehicles and shooting on the move in and around buildings proved a need for a more agile, adaptable platform. In addition, better accuracy and easier transitioning from daytime to nighttime shooting were identified as areas that should be improved.</p><p>The IDF began a collaboration with <a href="http://www.iwi.net/" target="_blank">Israel Weapon Industries</a> (IWI), the privatized entity that was previously the state-owned Israel Military Industries, on the research and development phase of the project in March 1995. It continued ergonomic tests and development on the gun for two years, and by 2000, the Tavor began to see broad testing with IDF infantry companies. The following year, field tests were conducted pitting the Tavor against the M4 at Camp Mitkan Adam, an IDF training base and home to its counter-terrorism warfare center and sniper school.</p><p>According to Amihai Dekel, a project manager with IWI in Israel and a reserve officer in the Israeli Special Forces, whose career has included troop commands at the platoon and company levels, the Tavor underwent a series of rigorous tests between November 2001 and March 2002 with two IDF brigades that evaluated it throughout different scenarios, theatres and configurations. Numerous aspects of the new platform were considered, including: Mean Rounds Between Failures (MRBF); accuracy and retention of zero using various sights; human ergonomics during extended periods of use, including marches as long as 37 miles; speed and accuracy of sighting in daytime and nighttime with iron sights, magnified and night vision optics, and lasers; use with the M203 grenade launcher; and maintenance-relevant issues.</p><p>Dekel said that, in the end, the Tavor prevailed over the M4, although he declined to share specifics about how the guns scored. “The results are clear, the Tavor is the [gun] of choice for the IDF and for Israeli special and elite forces.” The IDF officially adopted the Tavor in 2003 and within three years it was in the hands of infantry brigades and special forces throughout Israel.</p><p><strong>Formed For Function</strong></p><p>At first glance the Tavor is likely to evoke the usual criticisms typically leveled at the bullpup concept by its detractors-chief of which is that they are “awkward.” But that is often more a reaction to appearance rather than a thoughtful consideration of functionality. In the Tavor’s case, shouldering it goes a long way toward dispelling that notion.</p><p>By way of definition, a bullpup’s chamber, magazine well and fire-control components lie behind its pistol grip and trigger. That means no space is wasted on a buttstock that, typically, serves only to position a rifle against the shooter’s shoulder. Therein lies the bullpup’s chief advantage: short overall length with a standard-length barrel. For example, an M4 carbine with its stock fully collapsed measures 29¾ inches with a 14½-inch barrel. The Tavor measures 261⁄8 inches with a 16½-inch barrel. Also, compared to rifles with folding or collapsing stocks, Tavor and other bullpups need not be “deployed” before being employed.</p><p>According to Dekel, “The Tavor has exceptional situational ergonomics … I hold it naturally and can operate it efficiently even when I’m under physical pressure and fatigue, and the ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close-quarter situations and in different vehicles. The full-length barrel also means no loss of downrange ballistic efficiency.”</p><p>Despite the fact that it has a one-piece, injection-molded polymer stock, which gives the rifle its basic shape, the Tavor has a robust feel in the hand. Nothing about its parts or controls appears flimsy or underengineered. In the magazine well area, for example, the stock’s wall thickness averages ¼ inch. The trigger, fire-control components, flip-up sights, ejection port cover, magazine catch and push-button sling swivels are made of steel.</p><p><strong>Engineered To Excel</strong></p><p>Fieldstripping the semi-automatic-only Tavor SAR as sold by IWI U.S. and described hereafter, involves simply pushing out a captive cross pin located in the stock just forward of the buttplate’s top, allowing the buttplate to hinge downward and the gas piston/bolt carrier group to be withdrawn out the rear.</p><p>The black anodized aluminum top cover forms a full-length Picatinny rail and houses the front and rear sights-the former being adjustable for windage and elevation with an AR-type post. It is held at its front by a steel block and at two points midway back by two Allen-head machine screws. They engage two blocks clamped to the gas cylinder assembly, which is held to the barrel by two cross pins. The design essentially mates the mechanical and optical sights to the barrel, ensuring they retain zero.</p><p>Once the top cover, front swivel and foregrip assemblies, and the flash hider and its jam nut, are removed, the cocking assembly can be pulled forward off the gun. The barrel assembly is then removed with the aid of a specially shaped wrench by turning a socket on the gun’s right side 180 degrees while simultaneously pressing a safety catch on the opposite side. That rotates a pin out of engagement from a semi-circular groove in the barrel extension, which is machined with the chamber and locking lug recesses. The extension is pinned and threaded to the barrel proper, which measures 0.640 inches in diameter immediately ahead of it and 0.585 inches behind the muzzle. It is chambered in 5.56x45 mm NATO and rifled with a 1:7-inch twist.</p><p>The 7075-E6 hard-anodized machined aluminum receiver is a U-shaped chassis measuring 111⁄8x11⁄8x2 inches that is Teflon-coated. A 1.023-inch diameter hole at its front accepts the barrel extension. Rails machined into the receiver engage grooves in the side of the 7/8 x 3¼ x 21⁄8-inch bolt carrier. Mounted to the carrier is a 4340 steel piston crosspinned to a recoil-spring-guide tube along with the recoil spring and guide rod, a bolt-rotation-control bar and, at the rear, a polymer buffer. The 3-inch-long, one-piece right-hand bolt features a recessed face with radial locking lugs at 11 o’clock, 3 o’clock and 6 o’clock. The latter takes the form of two smaller lugs that coincide with M4-type feed ramps in the barrel extension. A 0.233-inch-wide extractor lies at 10 o’clock next to the uppermost lug, and a plunger-style ejector lies at 3 o’clock on the bolt’s face. The bolt is cammed into and out of battery, rotating only 36 degrees, by a 0.273-inch pin transversely mounted through its channel in the carrier.</p><p>When propellant gas enters the front of the gas block, it travels rearward in a cylindrical passage immediately in front of the gas cylinder, striking the face of the piston and driving the carrier assembly rearward, which unlocks the bolt by way of the cam pin. The bolt rotation control bar, which rests against a boss on the face of the barrel extension, then guides the topmost locking lug, keeping it in proper orientation while the bolt carrier continues to the rear as the bolt extracts and ejects a cartridge case. At the rearmost part of its travel the carrier compresses the recoil spring, striking the polymer buffer and returning the bolt to battery after stripping a fresh round from the magazine.</p><p><strong>Designed For Dynamic Handling</strong></p><p>The Tavor has a definite rearward weight bias if grasped by the pistol grip alone-but once it is taken in both hands and shouldered, it is actually quite well balanced and comfortable. “The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the user’s body, allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target,” explained Dekel.</p><p>The rubber buttplate rests fairly high in the shoulder pocket and stays put thanks to its tactile properties. The pistol grip is wide enough to be comfortable against the web of the shooting hand yet its somewhat rounded profile allows easy reach to the trigger. The flat, wide, oversize triggerguard, which angles at 45 degrees from the underside of the fore-end, can be grasped as an angled fore-grip or used as a palm rest by the off hand. The safety lies in the familiar location just above the centerline of the pistol grip and has a 90 degree throw. In addition, it is reversible in that the polymer lever itself, and the teardrop-shaped indicator on the opposite side are dovetailed to the ends of the shaft and can be removed and reversed simply by pressing in on a detent in their centers. The polymer magazine release lever lies on the centerline of the gun in front of the magazine well. Pressing it rearward cams a metal catch outward from the magazine body, allowing magazines to fall free. The trigger pull is quite good for a bullpup-likely because the trigger bar is drawn forward rather than pressed rearward as in the AUG, thereby minimizing flex in the mechanism.</p><p>Replacing magazines in any bullpup takes some practice, but once the shooter becomes familiar with such an arrangement it can mean staying on the gun throughout the movement without breaking cheekweld. With the Tavor, an additional bonus is that its bolt release, a large polymer lever behind the magazine well, can be tripped by the thumb of the off hand as the shooter inserts a magazine. Once practiced, it can be done in one fluid motion. The release also acts as a hold open when it is grasped at it rear and pulled downward after withdrawing the cocking lever to the rear. A polymer shell deflector and ejection port frame attach to the ejection side of the gun with a single Allen head screw. When changing the gun’s operation to the opposite side, they are simply swapped with the stamped steel ejection port cover. The cocking lever can be oriented on either side of the gun regardless of whether a right- or left-hand bolt is in use. A 5½-inch-long Picatinny rail serves as a cover for the slot on the opposite side. The lever, which is generously proportioned and angles upward slightly, does not reciprocate as the gun cycles.</p><p>At the range, reliability was 100 percent with primer strikes being well-defined and cases being ejected in a consistent pattern but not too forcefully from the gun. Despite the fact that the Tavor does not have a “forward assist” feature per se, the bolt carrier’s mass ensured that the bolt locked into battery without fail whether it was released by hand or by pressing the bolt release. Accuracy was on par with other service guns and included several five-shot groups slightly on either side of 1inch-interestingly with Federal’s economical American Eagle load.</p><p><strong>Set To Succeed?</strong></p><p>For those interested in modern semi-automatic arms, particularly arms with a military pedigree and, even more specifically, those of bullpup design, the Tavor SAR represents a breakthrough. While it is a newcomer on the American scene, its decade-plus of service with Israeli forces bodes well for its reputation as a globally recognized military small-arms platform and can only serve to bolster its reputation among civilian shooters. The fact that it is purpose-built to accommodate AR-style, or STANAG, magazines is no small matter-and is not likely lost on the legions of AR enthusiasts who already own them. </p><p>It is clear that the IWI Tavor SAR is different, and decidedly so, and that it is an excellent semi-automatic rifle in its own right chambered for one of America’s favorite defensive cartridges. The only question now is whether, like its namesake desert sentinel, the Tavor will establish itself with similar significance on the American firearm landscape.</p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> IWI US, Inc.; (717) 695-2081; <a href="http://iwi.us/" target="_blank">iwi.us</a></p><p><strong>Caliber:</strong> 5.56x45 mm NATO (.223 Rem.)

              <title><![CDATA[The Ross Rifle in U.S. Service]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>5/28/2013</em><br /></p><p>When the United States entered the Great War in the spring of 1917, our armed forces were ill-equipped for the conflict. All types of armaments were in short supply, especially service rifles. Production of the standardized Model 1903 Springfield was ramped up as quickly as possible, but the projected rate of manufacture would not be sufficient. To help alleviate the shortfall, the U.S. Model of 1917 rifle, a slightly modified version of the .303 British Pattern 1914 rifle, which had been manufactured under contract by three American firms, was adopted. Even with the M1917 and increased &rsquo;03 production, there remained a troubling shortage of rifles with which to train recruits and draftees flooding into camps across the country.</p><p>At times, recruits were issued broomsticks to practice close-order drill. Obsolescent .30-40 Krag rifles were called back into service, but additional arms were still needed. A number of Model 1891 Mosin-Nagant rifles, originally manufactured by Remington Arms and New England Westinghouse for the Russian government, were purchased. Even so, the Army still sought additional rifles for training use in the United States. In late 1917, another source became available when Mark II Ross .303 British rifles were deemed expendable by the Canadian military.</p><p>The Ross rifle was invented by Sir Charles Henry Augustus Fredrick Lockhart Ross, a Scottish nobleman, born in 1872. While still a student at Eton College, Ross received his first firearm patent in 1893. He subsequently refined the design and, in 1897, received another patent for an unusual straight-pull bolt-action rifle. The bolt was opened and locked by means of rotating locking lugs that operated in a manner somewhat similar to artillery pieces of the era. The straight &ldquo;back-and-forth&rdquo; manipulation of the bolt increased the rapidity of fire (at least in theory) as compared to the more conventional turning-bolt actions. </p><p>A limited number of Ross rifles was made in Great Britain, but the inventor soon decided to move his manufacturing operation to Canada where he had made numerous business and social contacts. Ross opened a manufacturing facility in Quebec City in 1903 and obtained a contract with the Canadian government for 12,000 Mark I rifles. The Ross rifle was touted as having several advantages over the Short, Magazine Lee-Enfield (SMLE), including lighter weight, a faster rate of fire and easier disassembly.</p><p>Sir Charles Ross also introduced the .280 Ross cartridge, one of the first commercial high-velocity sporting cartridges. While several variants of sporting and commercial rifles were made, the Canadian military was Ross&rsquo; most important customer. There were eventually three major variants of Ross military rifles: the Mark I; Mark II; and Mark III. And there were also a number of sub-variants of each type. In order to have commonality in ammunition with the SMLE rifle, the Ross military rifles were chambered for the standard .303 British cartridge. Eventually about 420,000 Ross service rifles were manufactured, of which the British government purchased 342,040.</p><p>The Ross rifle variant that saw the widest issue by the Canadian military was the Mark II. The gun weighed slightly less than 10 pounds and had a 30&frac12;- barrel with an overall length of 50&frac14; inches. While it aided in accuracy and increased muzzle velocity, the relatively long barrel resulted in a rather unwieldy arm in the tight confines of trench warfare.</p><p>The rifle was fitted with the &ldquo;Harris Controlled Platform Magazine,&rdquo; which was a lever on the right side just in front of the receiver that could be depressed to make loading easier. The barrel-mounted folding-leaf rear sight was similar to the German Mauser&rsquo;s sight. The left side of the Mark II receiver was marked &ldquo;Ross Rifle Co. Quebec, Canada 1905/Patented.&rdquo; Most of the exterior metal components of the Ross rifles were blued, and the stocks and handguards were crafted from good-quality walnut. The front sight blade was protected by a removable metal cover.</p><p>The blade of the Ross rifle bayonet was somewhat unusual and has been described as having a &ldquo;butcher knife&rdquo; configuration. The bayonet&rsquo;s unmarked blade was 101&frasl;8-inches long and about 11&frasl;8-inches wide. The pommel was marked &ldquo;Ross Rifle Co./Quebec&rdquo; with patent dates. The scabbard for the Ross bayonet was made of brown leather and had a reinforced throat. A leather belt loop was attached to the scabbard. </p><p>The Canadian 1st Infantry Division troops deployed to France in World War I with their Ross rifles in hand and were soon in the thick of combat. While Ross sporting rifles were impressive on the pre-war target ranges, problems quickly arose when the military variants began to see use in the muck and mire of the trenches on the Western Front during the First World War. The straight-pull bolt mechanism often became inoperable when exposed to even modest amounts of dirt and mud, which were omnipresent in the trenches.</p><p>Another serious flaw in the Ross was that the rifle&rsquo;s bolt could be incorrectly assembled, which could permit it to fire without being securely locked. This situation could cause potentially disastrous results to the shooter. Due to these problems, it is reported that soon after the Battle of Ypres in 1914, some Canadian soldiers threw away their Ross rifles after they had hopelessly jammed. They were replaced with SMLE rifles obtained from dead and wounded British soldiers. One Canadian infantry officer is said to have commented that it could take five men to keep one Ross rifle in operation!</p></p><p><p><br /></p><p>Initially, the Canadian military would not admit there was anything wrong, and the rifles continued to be issued to troops in France. But it eventually became crystal clear that the Ross was too badly flawed a military rifle to permit continued front-line use. It simply wasn&rsquo;t up to the task. In July 1916, Sir Douglas Haig ordered that the Ross rifles be withdrawn from service and replaced by the British SMLE. Limited numbers of Mark IIs, fitted with American Model 1913 Warner &amp; Swasey &ldquo;Musket Sights&rdquo; (prismatic rifle telescopes), continued to be used by some Canadian snipers. The superbly accurate Ross proved to be an excellent sniper rifle, because snipers, as compared to the average infantrymen, could keep their rifles relatively clean.</p><p>After withdrawal from front-line service, the Ross rifles were utilized by the Canadians and British for training purposes. After the United States entered the war, the Ross rifles in storage in Canada were viewed as a potential source of training rifles for our nation as well. The Canadian government was initially approached by the adjutant-general of the State of New York to see if some arrangements could be made to obtain sufficient numbers of the Ross rifles for training the New York State Guard troops (analogous to today&rsquo;s National Guard) slated for eventual deployment overseas. Negotiations were soon taken over by representatives from the U.S. War Dept. as training rifles were also sorely needed by the rapidly expanding U.S. Army.</p><p>On Nov. 17, 1917, an agreement was reached for the purchase of 20,000 Mark II Ross rifles from the Canadian government, complete with bayonets, scabbards, slings and oil bottles for $12.50 each. A quantity of spare parts (at a cost of $7,814.78) and about 2,000 Ross rifle manuals were also procured along with 4,629,470 rounds of .303 British ammunition (at a cost of $20 per 1,000). About half the Ross rifles were acquired by the State of New York for &ldquo;&hellip; defense purposes&rdquo; (State Guard units). The remaining rifles were purchased by the U.S. Army and divided in equal numbers (5,000 each) between Camp Sherman, Ohio, and Camp Devens, Mass.</p><p>It is reported that many of the rifles issued to the Army subsequently had the original Ross slings replaced with M1917 Kerr slings. This web sling had recently been adopted for the M1903 and M1917 rifles to replace the standardized M1907 leather sling and was readily adaptable to the Ross as well. </p><p>The Ross rifle stocks were typically stamped on the right side (between the grip and the butt) with Canadian army unit markings. The serial number was applied to the bottom of the stock on the grip. The Mark II rifles subsequently procured by the U.S. Army were also stamped with an Ordnance Dept. &ldquo;flaming bomb&rdquo; and &ldquo;U.S.&rdquo; in the same location. It has been reported that at least some of the Ross rifles acquired by New York were stamped &ldquo;NY&rdquo; on the stocks. The Ross bayonets procured by the United States also had an Ordnance &ldquo;flaming bomb&rdquo; over &ldquo;U.S.&rdquo; stamped on the obverse grip. The same type of markings were applied to the leather scabbards as well. </p><p>After World War I, the American-owned Ross rifles were declared surplus, and some were sold via the Director of Civilian Marksmanship (DCM) to NRA members, initially for $5 each. There were few takers, and the price was later reduced to $3.50, but they still weren&rsquo;t big sellers. By 1926, the remaining unsold Ross rifles were returned to storage until 1940, when they were repatriated to Canada under provisions similar to Lend-Lease. It is reported that many of these rifles were still in their World War I-era Canadian military packaging when they were returned.</p><p>While the Ross rifles did not see overseas combat duty in the hands of the American Doughboys (which was a good thing given their prior performance with the Canadians), the rifles did make available a number of badly needed M1903s and M1917s for combat units rather than training duty. While obviously a flawed combat rifle, it was entirely satisfactory for the limited role it played as a training rifle in the U.S. Army&rsquo;s arsenal during the &ldquo;Great War.&rdquo; It is a rather sad legacy for a military rifle, though, when among the best things that can be said for it is, &ldquo;Hey, it was better than a broomstick!&rdquo;</p></p>]]></bodyContent>

Heng woke to the sound of his 14-year-old son screaming. Realizing his son was in danger, Heng jumped out of bed and grabbed his gun. The armed intruders confronted Heng and a struggle ensued. Heng fired several shots which caused the men to flee. One suspect suffered fatal gunshot wounds and the second suspect was reportedly still at large. It's believed that the suspects were attempting to rob the jewelry store Heng runs on the first floor of his home.

Police say the two suspects broke in to the gas station wearing ski masks and proceeded to the cash register. The two suspects were unaware that the gas station owner and Iraq war veteran Shawn Schank was still in the building. Police say that Schank ran towards the suspects and kicked one of them to the ground. He then retrieved his AR-15 from his office and ordered them to leave the business. According to police, one of the suspects peeled his mask off and pleaded that Schank not shoot him. They then fled on foot as Schank called 911. Police say that Schank recognized the face of the suspect that removed his mask, which led to the arrest of the two individuals.

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>The swing-out cylinder DA/SA revolver has been around since the 1870s and has been refined in many ways. While there are variations in the common brands and models, they pretty much remain alike with their handling. However, they usually differ in the way you get the cylinder open for extraction and loading. <a href="http://www.coltsmfg.com/" target="_blank">Colt</a> always used a pull-back latch, originally &ldquo;L&rdquo; shaped and evolved into a gracefully rounded knob. <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CustomContentDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=750001&amp;catalogId=750051&amp;content=11001" target="_blank">Smith &amp; Wesson</a> favored a dished-out button that you pressed forward to allow the cylinder to swing out. When <a href="http://www.cz-usa.com/products/by-brand/dan-wesson/" target="_blank">Dan Wesson</a> came along with the flat lever that tilts down to release the cylinder, it was mounted forward of the cylinder on the left side of the frame. That unusual arrangement drew criticism until PPC shooters discovered the utility of the system&rsquo;s ease of reloading.</p><p><a href="http://www.taurususa.com/index.cfm" target="_blank">Taurus</a> became a force in the market in the 80s and stuck with a system similar to the S&amp;W in that the dished out latch went forward. Interestingly, when Taurus started making big magnum revolvers, they went to a system that required a Dan Wesson-type latch along with a S&amp;W type latch&mdash;two latches. <a href="http://www.ruger.com/index.html" target="_blank">Ruger&rsquo;s</a> first DA/SA revolvers were introduced in the 1970s and proved to be fine sixguns. The cylinder latch was, in my opinion, the best of them all. Mounted high on the left recoil shield, a lever is in direct line with the cylinder axis, completely out of the way of speed loaders. The latch tilts inward.<br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>5/24/2013</em><br /></p><p>Geography has not been particularly kind to Poland. Being sandwiched between Germany and Russia, one of the first things The Second Polish Republic did after being guaranteed sovereignty following World War I was to get its military on a sound footing.</p><p>In 1925 an arms factory was set up at Radom in Central Poland to produce Mauser-style rifles. Five years later, it was decided to build a proprietary service sidearm, and all of the currently available arms were tested with the goal of adopting one&mdash;or of developing a pistol of its own. At the trials held in 1935 one gun came out on top: a Browning M1911/Hi-Power variant conceived by designers Piotr Wilniewczvy and Jan Skrzpinski. Undoubtedly nationalism played something of a part in the final decision, but the fact remained that the gun really turned out to be world-class.</p><p>The 9 mm Luger Vis 35 was one of the highest-quality military pistols made before World War II. The materials used were the best, and the fit and finish were commercial-grade. Early guns were marked on the left side of the slide, &ldquo;F.B. RADOM,&rdquo; (Fabryka Broni Radom) surrounding the date of manufacture (1936-39) and &ldquo;VIS-wz.[model] 35/Pat. Nr 15567.&rdquo; A Polish national eagle emblem divided the two markings. The brown checkered plastic stocks were emblazoned with the large initials &ldquo;FB&rdquo; on the left panel and &ldquo;VIS&rdquo; on the right.&rdquo;</p><p>When Germany defeated Poland in 1939, the Germans captured the Radom factory and turned its capabilities toward supplying arms for the Nazi war machine. The Vis 35 was renamed the &ldquo;P.35(p)&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Pistole 35 (polnisch&rdquo;). Thousands were made at Radom, some with barrels made by Steyr in Austria, as German officials feared that if all the parts were made in Poland, complete guns would be smuggled to partisans. Eventually entire pistols were assembled at Steyr.</p><p>Collectors separate Vis 35s into several categories. First is the pure Polish Eagle models made before World War II. Next are the Nazi-capture Polish Eagles, which still exhibit the national motif but also have German waffenampt marks. Finally, the P.35(p) has three variants: Type I has all three levers (hammer drop, takedown and slide stop) and the shoulder stock grip slot. Type II has all three levers but no stock slot, and Type III has only two levers (takedown and hammer drop) and no slot. </p><p>The Vis 35 shown here is a Radom-manufactured Type III in NRA Excellent condition, showing little use or wear. The finish is blued (some have a phosphate finish), and exterior is roughly milled. As such, this gun is worth in the $550 to $625 range. </p><p><strong>Gun:</strong> Vis 35<br /><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Fabryka Broni Radom<br /><strong>Serial Number:</strong> C0170<br /><strong>Condition:</strong> NRA Excellent<br /><strong>Caliber:</strong> 9 mm Luger<br /><strong>Manufactured:</strong> c. 1943<br /><strong>Value:</strong> $550 to $625</p><p><img title="Polish Radom Pistol" src="../../Webcontent/gallery/246/2042PolishRadomPistol_web.jpg" alt="Polish Radom Pistol" width="644" height="460" /><br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[The .22 Magnum for Self-Defense]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>5/24/2013</em><br /></p><p>A practical personal protection plan should include a handgun, but that handgun should, without question, be one you&rsquo;re comfortable with. As you become more experienced you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to further evaluate the situation and trade-up as your comfort and skill levels increase. For some, a .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire (WMR) might be the best place to start. It&rsquo;s also affordable, readily available and relatively easy to shoot.</p><p>The .22 WMR is just one of many cartridges that comes in handguns sized for personal protection or concealed carry. A compact and light handgun like <a href="http://www.ruger.com/index.html" target="_blank">Ruger&rsquo;s</a> new 16-ounce LCR is a perfect example of a carry-size .22 WMR revolver. For those who want to carry the smallest handgun possible, North American Arms&rsquo; less-than-6-ounces Mini-Revolvers, with 1-inch barrels, are about as small as small gets.</p><p>Many consider the .22 WMR too small for self-defense, but what do the facts and some common sense tell us? To answer this question we need to keep things in perspective. Unlike hunters, those who use a handgun to thwart violence don&rsquo;t primarily intend to kill. The goal is to make the bad guy stop doing bad things. Handguns stop a threat in three ways. One is by causing enough pain that the bad guy submits or voluntarily decides further violent action is a bad idea. Another way is through incapacitation, which is an involuntary reaction on the part of the bad guy in response to being shot. Incapacitation can be instant or it can take a long time.</p><p>The third way handguns stop evil intent is through fear. No one wants to get shot with any gun. Law enforcement personnel will tell you that they point guns at bad guys much more often than they shoot them, and the most common response when a gun is pointed at someone is that they stop being bad and put their hands up or run. This voluntary surrender is the most common and effective way handguns stop crime, whether in the hands of police officers or citizens.</p><p>What we want to explore here is how effective a .22 WMR handgun might be at triggering these three outcomes. If just pointing the gun at the bad guy is enough, then caliber or cartridge is of no consequence&mdash;score one for the WMR. If a shot is required, will the .22 WMR be capable of causing enough pain to make the bad guy submit or voluntarily stop, and is it even capable of causing swift, involuntary incapacitation?</p><p>Terminal ballistics testing in 10 percent ordnance gelatin is about the only way we can gauge the potential effectiveness of any cartridge. By comparing how various .22 WMR loads perform in ordnance gelatin with how other, more trusted, larger-caliber handgun loads perform, we can hypothesize on the fight-stopping potential of the .22 WMR.</p><p>Make no mistake, velocity matters when it comes to terminal performance. It&rsquo;s why .357 Mag. is more effective at stopping bad guys than .38 Spl. With the .22 WMR, velocity is just as, if not more, important because of its relatively small bullet. Interestingly, many .22 WMR loads are made for use in rifles, and the longer barrels result in substantially more velocity than if the same loads were shot through handguns. With that in mind, I conducted a series of tests with various .22 WMR loads fired from barrels as short as 1 inch to as long as 22 inches. The results can be found in the accompanying table, but before you try to digest all those numbers, let&rsquo;s consider what these tests actually tell us.</p><p>Admittedly, 10 percent ordnance gelatin, as often as it is used and referenced, is not the same as a bad guy. It is simply a ballistic test medium which is thought to offer the same resistance to a bullet as would muscle tissue. It does not replicate skin, ribs, cartilage or fat and, in fact, very often the way a bullet performs in living tissue is quite different than how it performs in gelatin. Ordnance gelatin is merely a test medium that offers comparisons between projectiles on an even playing field.</p><p>So what you see in these results is how these loads compare to each other and to more powerful defensive handgun loads such as the 9 mm Luger and the .45 ACP. With those cartridges you can generally expect penetration in the 13-inch range. Interestingly, if we average the penetration of the .22 WMR loads tested from handguns with barrels ranging from 1 inch to 4&frac12; inches we find they penetrated to just over 12 inches. Not much difference.</p><p>The average 9 mm Luger velocity from defensive handguns with varying barrel lengths runs about 1,175 fps. From a .45 ACP the average muzzle velocity is almost 1,000 fps. Averaging all the .22 WMR loads tested in all the different handgun barrel lengths we find the muzzle velocity to be about 1,050 fps. From a numbers standpoint, the velocity and penetration of the .22 WMR, when compared to a 9 mm or a .45, is not all that different.</p><p>The difference in the terminal performance of a .22 WMR when compared to a 9 mm or a .45 is mostly in expansion and energy. Expansion is important because if you have two holes that are the same depth, the hole that has the largest diameter will also be the one that is likely to do the most tissue damage. The average frontal diameter of recovered .22 WMR bullets is about 0.27 inches. That is substantially less than the average for the 9 mm Luger, at 0.55 inches, and the .45 ACP at 0.61 inches.</p><p>So, on average, you can expect a .45 ACP to damage about 3.79 cubic inches of tissue and a 9 mm Luger to damage about 3 cubic inches of tissue. The best .22 WMR loadings will damage less than 1 cubic inch of tissue.</p><p>Actually, statistics&mdash;if you can trust statistics&mdash;support the hypothesis that it&rsquo;s the fear of getting or having been shot that most often leads to a fight being stopped. Of course fear and even pain will most likely have little influence on someone high on meth, crack or even adrenalin. In those instances it&rsquo;s the involuntary incapacitation that must be relied upon. Instant involuntary incapacitation with any handgun is rare and, with a .22 WMR damaging four times less tissue and hitting with about a fourth the energy of a 9 mm Luger or .45, I think it&rsquo;s logical to assume involuntary incapacitation with a .22 WMR cartridge is four times less likely to happen.</p><p>But what if you can&rsquo;t be concerned with such numbers? What if a .22 WMR is the most powerful handgun you can shoot effectively? What if a .22 WMR is all you have? What ammunition should you choose for a .22 WMR defensive handgun if that&rsquo;s what you are going to carry?</p><p>Based on the testing I conducted, two things were obvious: Barrels of about an inch in length did not generate enough velocity for reliable expansion with most .22 WMR loads. Terminal performance from barrels between 2 inches (1.8 inches) and 5 inches (4.6 inches) was, for all practical purposes, identical. It was also clear from the results, with the exception of four loads; <a href="http://www.hornady.com/" target="_blank">Hornady&rsquo;s</a> Critical Defense, <a href="http://www.speer-ammo.com/" target="_blank">Speer&rsquo;s</a> Gold Dot, <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester&rsquo;s</a> PDX1 and the somewhat surprising <a href="http://www.cci-ammunition.com/" target="_blank">CCI</a> TNT load, no other .22 WMR load will expand from a handgun. The Hornady, Speer and Winchester loads, which performed well and even expanded through denim&mdash;except from the 1-inch barrel&mdash;seem to be the obvious choice, especially with penetration around the magic 13-inch mark. No surprise here; all of these loads were purpose-built for the defensive handgun. On the other hand, the 30-grain CCI TNT load was the only load that expanded from every firearm, in every test.</p><p>Even though these loads did expand, they did not expand much; 0.19 inches of expansion was the most recorded from any handgun, and bear in mind that is slightly more than 3/16 inches. The .22 WMR is drastically handicapped by power and energy&mdash;energy that&rsquo;s needed to push through clothing, ribs and muscle. It might make just as much sense to use loads with non-expanding projectiles such as the 40-grain full metal jacket or common hollow point, which should penetrate slightly deeper.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s another consideration. The Hornady, Speer and Winchester loads utilize flash-retarding propellants. That means that if you have to shoot in near darkness, you won&rsquo;t be blinded by the light&mdash;muzzle flash. Even though the CCI TNT load expanded well in every test, the muzzle flash from it and the other loads was like a fireball. That might scare your attacker more, but it does nothing for your night vision.</p><p>I still believe any gun is better than no gun. I also believe there are a lot of cartridges better suited for personal protection than a .22 WMR. Still, as a deterrent, it&rsquo;s probably as effective as anything else. As for being able to bring about voluntary submission it&rsquo;s anybody&rsquo;s guess how this cartridge should be rated; we simply cannot predict psychological reactions. Where the .22 WMR appears to fall short is in its ability to bring about instant involuntary incapacitation. </p><p>You&rsquo;ll definitely need something that makes a bigger hole if that&rsquo;s your goal.</p><p><img title="Terminal Performance .22 Mag" src="../../Webcontent/gallery/247/204222MagTerminalPerformance.jpg" alt="Terminal Performance .22 Mag" width="644" height="995" /></p><p><img title="Terminal Performance .22 Mag Page 2" src="../../Webcontent/gallery/247/204222MagTerminalPerformance_2.jpg" alt="Terminal Performance .22 Mag Page 2" /><br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[FNH USA Longslide]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>Last week, I, along with a few other editors from NRA Publications, had the opportunity to meet with representatives from <a href="http://www.fnhusa.com/" target="_blank">FNH USA</a> at the <a href="http://peacemakernational.com/" target="_blank">Peacemaker National Training Center</a> in Gerrardstown, W.Va., to get some hands-on time with a few of the company&rsquo;s newer firearms, along with a couple of its more popular platforms&mdash;the <a title="Read the full Rifleman review on the SCAR. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/fn-scar/" target="_blank">SCAR</a> and the Five-seveN. </p><p>After a short round-table discussion on some of the new guns, we headed to the range to try out the FN SPR A5M in .308 Win. and the Ballista in .338 Lapua Mag. at 600 yards. We also received a look at a targeting system that uses the sound of a bullet hitting a target to show shot placement. Both rifles showed excellent accuracy; I was able to place three rounds in a 1-inch grouping at 600 yards with the A5M, though I did accuse the group of using technology to convince me that I was performing better than I&rsquo;m truly capable of shooting. </p><p>Then, we headed to a shorter range to try a few handguns and the SCAR. The Five-seveN stood up to its reputation in both accuracy and recoil control, allowing extremely fast follow-up shots that consistently rang the steel. However, the handgun that caught my eye was the FNS-9 Competition. </p><p>The FNS-9 Competition is a longslide version of the FNS-9 striker-fired pistol. It has many of the same features such as replaceable backstraps to fit most hands, manual safety for extra security, stainless-steel slide and cold-hammer forged stainless-steel barrel. It also has an additional inch in the slide and barrel for improved accuracy. </p><p>Now you wouldn&rsquo;t think that 1 inch would be that significant, but the additional sight radius made it much easier to shoot, allowing me to nail the steel nine shots out of 10 in a speed string. The most interesting feature of the FNS-9 Competition though, is that the slide will fit on all existing FNS-9 handguns, allowing shooters to use the same base for both concealed carry and competition. While the set up is currently only available as a full pistol, the reps said they were looking at making the slide available as a separate part. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll be reviewing this neat handgun soon. </p><p><img title="FNH USA FNS-9 Competition " src="../../Webcontent/gallery/247/2049FNHUSA_FNS9Competition_web.jpg" alt="FNH USA FNS-9 Competition " /><br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>By Paul Rackley</p><p>With 16 former competitors vying to be the best, Top Shot All Stars has begun. It was nice to see that the show returned for a fifth season, since rumor had the show slipping into oblivion due to the high costs of making the show&mdash;the high speed cameras that provide all that awesome bullet-entering-target footage are not cheap. </p><p>The first episode brought back all four previous winners, along with a few fan favorites, including two of mine&mdash;Kelly Bachand and Jamie Franks. I&rsquo;ve always felt that Kelly would have gone farther in Season One if he hadn&rsquo;t been the first contestant in the Shoot from Above challenge; the other shooters learned from watching his run. Later seasons had following shooters off site, so the producers must have noticed that as well. They also brought back Navy diver Jamie Franks, who sent a few of his fellow Season Two competitors home because he kept being sent to Elimination by the others. Of course, that can&rsquo;t happen this season, as there are no teams and only skill in shooting will determine who rises and falls. </p><p>The season started with a course where shooters fired three rifles at three targets after overcoming an obstacle before each set. It was a nice validation to see that Kelly had the best time of 1 minute and 26 seconds, beating Blake Miguez by 2 seconds. The shooters with the eight worst times were sent to the Proving Ground to determine who would compete in Elimination. The Proving Ground was simple&mdash;one shot from a Colt Peacemaker for each shooter, with the two farthest from the center competing in Elimination. This ended up forcing Gary Quesenberry and Greg Littlejohn to compete head-to-head with the Milkor M32A1 Grenade Launcher, sending Littlejohn packing. </p><p>It also seems as if the producers have finally listened to viewers and eliminated the drama of the house from the show. The only time the house was even shown was during the packing of the two competitors right before the Elimination round. In my opinion, this was a major improvement as I thought Season Three was the worst because it seemed as if the producers wanted to go the route of traditional reality shows and bring in shooters with attitude. Top Shot is about shooting, and that is what I want to see. We&rsquo;ll see if this continues. </p><p>Who has returned that you&rsquo;re anxious to see go all the way? I&rsquo;m holding out for Kelly, Jamie and Joe. <br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>In January, 61,000 people with pre-sharpened elbows, grumpy attitudes and viruses that have yet to be identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attended the huge petri dish known by most in the industry as the SHOT Show. Every new gun for 2013 was in attendance and available for a brief exam, if you were lucky enough to circumnavigate the 630,000-square-foot maze with all the other lab rats zigzagging between 1,600 exhibitors.</p><p>Actually, I love the SHOT Show, and every year I swap all my 401k funds into pharmaceutical companies and health-care providers sometime in December to take advantage of their temporarily increased profit margin. (Editor&rsquo;s Warning: this should not be taken as serious financial advice, since the author is living in North Carolina and has virtually no retirement set aside other than his meager weekend earnings as a collard green-sandwich peddler outside Fort Bragg.) Manufacturers, their reps, sales staff, media and congested SHOT Show babes come from across the globe to attend, bringing with them relatively benign bugs from their respective corners of the world. Think smallpox; then wonder at my wisdom for refusing gift blankets on the show floor. </p><p>Organized by the fine folks at the <a href="http://www.nssf.org/" target="_blank">National Shooting Sports Foundation</a> (NSSF), the SHOT Show is the largest gathering of firearm manufacturers/companies and media annually. The fact that a record-setting number of old friendships and inoculations are renewed at it every year, even during an economic downturn, speaks volumes about the critical role it plays in the industry and the dedication and professionalism of the NSSF staff.</p><p>All chiding aside, NSSF does an awesome job in making this THE event to attend. In my business, it&rsquo;s the only way to get the inside scoop, instantly, and still be able to ask questions. </p><p>But, today the organization took it one step further this week when it announced a firm has been retained to help market the event to even more prospective attendees. I kept telling them there were no gun writers in the Aleutians, Lithuania and the North Pole, but did they listen?</p><p>&ldquo;CSG Creative is pleased to be selected as the strategic marketing agency for the SHOT Show,&rdquo; Paige Cardwell, CSG Creative president proclaimed in the press release. &ldquo;We are looking forward to working with the SHOT Show team to enhance their marketing initiatives in target and emerging markets.&rdquo;</p><p>Nice pun on the &ldquo;target&rdquo; thing, but emerging markets? I can&rsquo;t find ammo, guns or a place to sit in the press room, and you&rsquo;re going to find more firearm enthusiasts? The horror! (Read that last sentence in your best Marlon Brando &ldquo;Apocalypse Now&rdquo; voice and it&rsquo;ll make more sense.)</p><p>The scariest part is the fact CSG Creative is liable to do it. The company has a long list of clients and a highly rated reputation for getting the job done. Here&rsquo;s a look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnHKDwuDklo" target="_blank">Cardwell in a video</a> explaining one of the firm&rsquo;s services. No, seriously, take a quick look. I know you want to. </p><p>Among the organizations that have benefitted from CSG&rsquo;s efforts are the International Dairy Foods Association, American Meat Institute, American Association of School Administrators, National School Boards Association and the International Association of Amusement Parks and Recreation. The most notable client, though, is the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists. </p><p>Coincidence? I think not. And people scoff at my SHOT Show-based investment strategy. <br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Shotgun: Hunting to Tactical]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Gun owners may run into the situation of needing a firearm to fill a particular shooting requirement at a time when money for a new gun isn't readily available. Recently I found myself in need of a tactical 12 gauge with an 18.5-inch cylinder bore barrel. This wasn't the first time a tactical pump would have come in handy, and it wasn't going to be the last. It was time to make the investment, but I wasn't ready to throw down more cash than I had to. So I turned to an idea that had crossed my mind before, namely, to see what it would cost to convert a sporting shotgun I already had into a tactical model using aftermarket accessories.</p><p>The base gun for the project would be a <a href="http://www.mossberg.com/" target="_blank">Mossberg</a> 835 Ulti-Mag Waterfowl model I picked up several years ago. For those who are unfamiliar with this gun, it's a serious piece of artillery. Designed to mimic the patterning properties of a 10-gauge shotgun, this version of the 835 is fitted with a 28-inch ribbed dual-bead barrel with a vented expansion chamber and oversized choke. This gun chambers 2 ¾-, 3- or 3 ½-inch 12-gauge shot shells. It's the 3 ½-inch shells that provide payloads comparable to the potent 10-gauge. The magazine tube, designed to hold four 3 ½-inch shells, will hold up to five 2 ¾-inch shells for a total of six rounds.</p><p>So for exactly what did I need this kind of firepower? The 835 was discounted as part of a seasonal sale at a local big-box store. It was priced for less than some of the 3-inch chambered plain-Jane 12 gauges I had under consideration as an all-purpose field gun. With the extra features and chamber cut for three shell lengths instead of two, the Mossberg 835 followed me home. Since then it has proved to be a reliable sporting shotgun. It certainly qualifies as over built for the light skeet loads that have made up most of its regular diet. With my shooting preferences leaning more toward handguns, this shotgun is broken in, but is far from worn out.</p><p>The conversion of the 835 for tactical applications was stymied before now because I was unable to locate a shorter barrel for this model. A search of the Mossberg catalog and website did not turn up factory-made, drop-in 18.5-inch cylinder bore barrels for the 835, although they are commonly available for Model 500 shotguns. Cutting the 28-inch barrel down to 18.5 inches was impractical, expensive and wasteful. I finally called the Mossberg service center and asked. To my surprise, I learned there was a plain (un-ribbed) blued 18.5-inch cylinder-bore barrel for the 835. Not only was it priced about the same as the Model 500 barrels, but it was designed to handle 3 ½-inch shells. When the barrel arrived it was easily swapped out with no gunsmithing required.</p><p>The next components installed were replacements for the wooden shoulder stock and forearm. Several tactical aftermarket shotgun stock options are available for the Mossberg, but not all of them are affordable. After doing a bit of homework, the <a href="http://www.phoenixtechnologygunstocks.com/" target="_blank">Phoenix Technology</a> Kicklite upgrade was selected.</p><p>The Phoenix kit includes a six-position AR-style shoulder stock with pistol grip, a stock mounted five-round shell holder and a matching polymer forearm replacement. The shoulder stock is fitted with a heavy-duty internal recoil reduction spring and a vented soft-rubber buttpad. Examining the stock reveals a shrouded ¾-inch gap between the pistol grip and shoulder stock to allow for stock movement along a steel support rod. The six-position adjustment allows the length of pull (LOP) to shift between 11.5 inches to 15 inches, which should successfully accommodate shooters of all sizes. The company thoughtfully included the tool required to remove the forearm retention ring, which made installing the forearm a painless experience.</p><p>The stock's slim polymer pistol grip was a good fit in the shooting hand, but it felt even better with a <a href="http://www.tuff1.com/" target="_blank">Tuff 1</a> grip sleeve installed. These universal grip covers are designed to mold themselves to just about any firearm grip style available and they provide an excellent no-slip hold.</p><p>The last addition to the shotgun was a <a href="http://www.hivizsights.com/" target="_blank">Hi Viz Shooting Systems</a> MPB-TAC Tactical shotgun sight. This snap-on fiber-optic sight arrives with a choice of four colors of light pipe to meet the user's preferences. Having used Hi Viz fiber-optic sights on other shotguns, this sight was simply too effective and affordable not to have one on board.</p><p>At the range, the newly assembled tactical 835 was both reliable and comfortable to work with. The accessories operated properly without any failures or breakages. The shorter barrel fit the receiver perfectly, and there were no ammunition related malfunctions. But would the 3½-inch chamber affect the tactical barrel's performance down range?</p><p>Most 18.5-inch unchoked shotguns, with 3-inch chambers, cause shot pellets to spread apart at a rate of about 1-inch-per-yard of distance traveled. In other words, shells fired at 7 yards will usually produce patterns about 7-inches across on average. This is not a universal truth, but it’s a good rule of thumb. Would an extra 1/2-inch cause a measurable pattern change? Formal pattern testing was conducted with 12x18-inch targets posted at 7 yards using 2 3/4-inch shotshells. <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester</a> Super Target No. 8 birdshot loads yielded 11-inch patterns, with <a href="http://www.federalpremium.com/" target="_blank">Federal Premium</a> Heavy Game No. 4 birdshot producing 10-inch patterns. Federal's standard velocity and Winchester's WinLite nine-pellet 00 buckshot loads both produced 4-inch patterns.</p><p>Pattern testing also allowed for an evaluation of the Phoenix Technology recoil-reduction stock, which the company says will reduce recoil by up to 50 percent. It proved to be quite effective with 2 ¾-inch shells. Birdshot loads, which tend to be the most comfortable of the 12-gauge shells to fire, produced modest levels of felt recoil with the Phoenix stock. Shooting the standard velocity buckshot load felt like a reduced velocity load. But the sweet spot for both stopping power and recoil reduction was produced using reduced velocity buckshot loads like the WinLite round. This stock and ammunition combination felt like firing a 20-gauge loaded with bird shot, which is a low and manageable amount of recoil for a 12 gauge. Was there a shell with enough punch to defeat the recoil reduction system? Yes, but it was a 3-inch hunting shell with a 2-ounce payload fired at 1,100 fps. That would be a stout round in any gun, so stick to the standard defense loads and the Phoenix system will do nicely.</p><p>So in the end, was the Mossberg 835 At-Home Tactical Conversion worth the expense? It depends on how you slice the money invested over time and your current needs. If the project was started with a brand new Model 835 purchased at the current suggested retail price ($497), and the accessories tacked on at their retail value ($340), then the answer would be no, it's not the best option. If you have more than $800 dollars to spend on a tactical shotgun, then you have the resources to look into some very nice models with extended magazines, advanced sight systems and additional features.</p><p>In this situation, the cost savings were found in starting the project with a base gun that was already paid for. The 835 was purchased for about 40 percent of today's new gun price, and it's already provided years of casual shooting service. Shopping around to find the best prices for the accessories shaved off $20 dollars more for a final out-of-pocket expense of about $320 (before taxes and shipping).</p><p>Using $320 dollars as a comparison point made the conversion a worthwhile endeavor. The one off-the-shelf tactical shotgun I could find in the current Mossberg catalog with the most similar features set to this conversion was a six-shot tactical Model 500, sporting a six-position stock and pistol grip, with the suggested retail price of $593. The conversion came close to about half the cost of that new defensive shotgun, plus it has a recoil-reductions stock, fiber-optic sight and a three-shell-size chamber instead of two. Best of all, the 835 can be converted back into a top-notch field piece in under a minute by simply switching out the barrels. With all of the accessories working as advertized, this is an at-home project that will continue to provide a solid shooting value for years to come. The only problem I see with this shotgun is if I take it to a tactical shooting class, some smart-aleck is going to make fun of the shiny gold trigger.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Century Int'l Arms 1873 Single Action Millennium]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>6/13/2013</em><br /></p><p>It has been said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. If true, Colt&rsquo;s <a title="Read what Elmer Keith had to say about the SAA. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/colt-single-action-army-elmer-keith/" target="_blank">Single Action Army</a> (SAA) revolver might be the most fawned over firearm ever. Known as the Model P or Peacemaker, Colt&rsquo;s SAA was designed for the U.S. government service revolver trials of 1872. In subsequent years, soldiers, lawmen, cowboys and outlaws would make it the most iconic firearm of the American West. The fascination and appeal of the revolver has not diminished, which is why <a href="http://www.centuryarms.com/" target="_blank">Century Int&rsquo;l Arms</a>, a company that partners with overseas manufacturers to bring interesting firearms stateside, is offering the 1873 Single Action Millennium Revolver.</p><p>Manufactured by Italy&rsquo;s Pietta, the gun imitates the third generation Colt&rsquo;s SAA, which has been available since 1976. The test revolver had a 5&frac12;-inch barrel and a case-colored frame. The remaining metal surfaces were deeply blued and the general fit and finish were well executed, as there were no proud areas, nor external milling or finish marks.</p><p>Those looking for an authentic clone of Colt&rsquo;s SAA might be a tad disappointed in anything but the real McCoy. That is because, to some, the patent markings that appear on the Colt&rsquo;s are aesthetically pleasing. Outwardly, the Italian copy does look like an original Colt&rsquo;s, and it will fool all but the most savvy at arm&rsquo;s reach. One internal area where the 1873 Single Action Millennium revolver does mirror the Colt&rsquo;s is in that it too has a round recoil plate machined and set into the breech face. There&rsquo;s also the distinctive four clicks&mdash;one for each letter in &ldquo;Colt&rdquo;&mdash;when the hammer is cocked.</p><p>The trigger pull was consistent at 5 pounds with absolutely no creep or take up, and overtravel measured about 1/8 inches. We prefer a pull weight of around 4 pounds; however, the crispness of the 1873&rsquo;s trigger left little to be desired. The action was also smooth. After 200 rounds the cylinder was marked around its circumference by the bolt.</p><p>A nice surprise was that the <a title="Learn more about revolvers. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/handguns-revolver" target="_blank">revolver</a> was sighted-in perfectly straight out of the box. Always a concern with a fixed-sight single-action revolver, no alteration was necessary; at 10 yards the revolver delivered bullets dead-on to an inch low with all loads tested. Another pleasant discovery came during accuracy testing at 25 yards. The average for five consecutive, five-shot groups with three loads measured 1.86 inches; for a $375 revolver, we were quite pleased.</p><p>With &ldquo;bench&rdquo; testing completed, we fired 10 shots from the 1873 Single Action Millenium Revolver at a 12x18-inch steel target at 50 yards from the standing position and achieved seven hits. Likewise, at 100 yards from the prone position, we scored six strikes&mdash;impressive to say the least. </p><p>Concerning the ammunition, we noted inconsistent velocities during testing. With the <a href="http://www.federalpremium.com/" target="_blank">Federal </a>and <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester</a> loads, velocities were about 200 fps slower than advertised; however, the <a href="http://www.sellier-bellot.cz/" target="_blank">Sellier &amp; Bellot</a> load, touted as reaching 708 fps was spot-on. Consistency with regard to velocity was found only with the Winchester load.</p><p>Concerning functioning, only after becoming exceptionally dirty were there issues, and even then, they were reserved to Sellier &amp; Bellot loads binding the rotation of the cylinder and making it difficult&mdash;not impossible&mdash;to cock. There were also some case size inconsistencies with the Sellier &amp; Bellot ammunition, which likely exacerbated the problem. And, in some instances, the claw on the hand would scar the case&rsquo;s head. None of these issues were present with the Winchester loads. </p><p>In addition to the 1873 Single Action Millennium Revolver we evaluated, there are other variants offered by Century Int&rsquo;l Arms, including 4&frac34;- or 5&frac12;-inch-barreled versions and those in .357 Mag. A less expensive version with a bead blasted, matte finish is also available in each configuration. </p><p>For those interested in cowboy-action shooting or looking for an inexpensive recreational revolver, the Century Int&rsquo;l Arms 1873 Single Action Millennium Revolver represents a tremendous value. In fact, given its performance, it&rsquo;s likely one of the best deals going for a clone of the famous Peacemaker.</p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> F. A.P. F.

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>By Paul Rackley </p><p>The producers just couldn&rsquo;t stand it anymore, I guess. This week&rsquo;s Top Shot entered the house multiple times to show the competitors discussing various issues&mdash;I still only want to see shooting&mdash;and even baking brownies. It was probably to show that two people who actually got along well were going head to head to send one home. At least they didn&rsquo;t try to invent drama for the sake of drama, and nobody has shown signs of being a queen. </p><p>In a twist on a previous season&rsquo;s head-to-head match up with the Smith &amp; Wesson .500, competitors faced off with the SIG Sauer P229 in a challenge that was about speed&mdash;the first to hit three targets at varying distances won&mdash;and choosing the right competitor to go against. Times were extremely fast, but Kelly, the long-range rifle expert, whipped them all and won a special prize from Bass Pro Shops. It was interesting to see that only two of the competitors who chose their opponents beat the person they picked. </p><p>I was, however, disappointed to see Jamie sandbag during practice to fool the others into thinking he wasn&rsquo;t familiar with the SIG. I want to the winner to win because he or she is the best, not through trickery. It worked, though, as William chose Jamie, but was sent to the Proving Ground as a loser. </p><p>At the Proving Ground the seven shooters used the SIG P229 to determine that Chee and Gabby were going to the Elimination Challenge. While I like Chee, I was kind of happy that he was being sent, as twice now he tried to take the weak course by hoping to not have to choose anyone. It was also interesting to see this pair go head to head as they are good friends (they were the ones making brownies) and Chee fired the shot that sent Gabby home in Season Four. </p><p>In the Elimination Challenge, Gabby became the first woman to send a fellow competitor home by slowly and surely knocking down the four rows of six plates that required consecutive hits or all the plates in that row would rise up again. While Gabby definitely had better accuracy in the challenge, it was plan execution that ultimately sent Chee home. Every time he missed, he reloaded rather than just continue shooting and reloading when the gun was empty. The .45 Schofield is a top &ndash;break revolver that ejects the cases, he wasted a lot of time chasing down live rounds that he could have fired. Gabby just blasted away to victory, and proved that competition is not always about being the best. Sometimes it&rsquo;s about being the smartest. <br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Father’s Day?]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>Your father was probably the one who got you started in shooting, yet you&rsquo;re trolling the bargain bins in discount stores this week, hoping to find something inexpensive that will satisfy his insatiable appetite for dust-collecting knickknacks. My father&rsquo;s attic was home to two-dozen Chia pets, an uneaten five-pound gummy bear and a pet rock collection currently the subject of a U.S. Geological Survey all-points-bulletin. All were misguided gifts for the avid outdoorsman and shooter. </p><p>Help break this tragic trend by giving dad something firearm related&mdash;even if it is a little tongue in cheek&mdash;this Father&rsquo;s Day. There&rsquo;s still hope, and with expedited shipping we have the time to stop this vicious cycle.</p><p>I&rsquo;d tell you to score some <a title="Find out more about where the ammo has gone. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blogs/where-ammo-gone-part-deux/" target="_blank">ammo</a>, but right now that&rsquo;s not even funny. Plus Dad probably has some pet loads, so let&rsquo;s take a look at what&rsquo;ll really make him smile on Sunday.</p><p>Does he have a handgun with an accessory rail? With this year&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.isciencetimes.com/articles/5271/20130528/cicada-invasion-2013-17-year-samuel-orr.htm" target="_blank">cicada invasion</a>, there&rsquo;s no telling how many of the noisy buggers will bunker up for 17 more years in the petunias. There&rsquo;s only one solution and it&rsquo;s the cicada&rsquo;s worst nightmare&mdash;LaserLyte&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.laserlyte.com/collections/pistol-bayonet" target="_blank">Pistol Bayonet</a>. </p><p>Do you remember the family vacation when dad had chili dogs with extra onions for lunch at Truth or Consequences, N.M., and it seemed like a scene from the 24 hours of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067334/" target="_blank">Le Mans</a> before you reached the Springfield, Mo., hotel? Hang a <a href="http://www.hoppes.com/cleaning-accessories/hoppe-s-no-9-air-freshener" target="_blank">Hoppe&rsquo;s Air Freshener</a> in the old family wagon, and heal the decades-old scars. </p><p>Maybe dad has been looking a little fatigued lately. If that&rsquo;s the case, pick up some <a href="http://www.thortacticalenergy.com/products/tactical-energy-sf" target="_blank">Thor Global Defense Group Tactical</a> Energy drink. </p><p>After a long day at the range, there&rsquo;s no reason he should struggle when opening bottles of his favorite beverage. Get him a <a href="http://www.laruetactical.com/larue-tactical-beverage-entry-tool-lt205" target="_blank">LaRue Tactical Beverage Entry Tool Dillo</a>. I have three strategically staged throughout the house for emergency response and they stand upright, at attention, as if eager for their next perilous mission. </p><p>Heck, score him some <a href="http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/Search.aspx?site=All+Products&amp;num=15&amp;q=zombie+targets&amp;fgb=t" target="_blank">zombie targets</a>. Post your own selections in the comments section and we might just stop the vicious cycle of abandonment that has seen this celebration become a financial boon for tie, chia, shoe and rock salesmen. </p><p>Don&rsquo;t misconstrue this blog post as yet another feeble attempt at humor. It&rsquo;s not meant to be funny. It&rsquo;s a reminder that every year, in a misguided effort to please dad, we blindly hand our hard-earned cash over to companies that may actually oppose firearm ownership, when there&rsquo;s dozens of small and inexpensive items from gun companies he would love to receive on Sunday. They probably won&rsquo;t produce any chuckles, but you can&rsquo;t go wrong with gun oil, cleaning solution, bore brushes, mops, rods, patches and just about everything related to cleaning and maintenance. Ammo would be good, but the last time I checked the Holy Grail was still missing, too. </p><p>Whatever you do, get him something related to what he enjoys. Don&rsquo;t be lazy and buy your father a dust-collecting gizmo recommended by a self-proclaimed Internet expert. Oh, wait a minute.</p><p>Happy Father&rsquo;s Day! Get out there and make it a great one.</p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Remington Versa Max Tactical]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>6/12/2013<br /></p><p>When <a href="http://www.remington.com/" target="_blank">Remington</a> rolled out the Versaport gas system in 2010 with its new <a title="Watch the video on the Versa Max gas system. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/videos/remington-versa-max/" target="_blank">Versa Max lineup</a> of shotguns, it was nothing short of revolutionary. Dual pistons cycle the action, drawing their energy from seven strategically located ports within the chamber/barrel. As shotshell length increases, the number of ports exposed to tap energy decreases, a system that regulates pressure so reliably that the 12-gauge shotgun could digest 2 &frac34;-, 3- and 3 &frac12;-inch shotshells in virtually every load imaginable. </p><p>For those interested in home-defense, 3-gun and survival, the ruggedly simple system seemed like an ideal platform, and flawless performance in the 1,000-round-a-day <a title="See how the Versa Max fared in the Argentina. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/Remington-VersaMax-shotgun/" target="_blank">dove fields of Argentina</a> drove home that point. But, there was no tactical version, and non-hunting shooters stood on the sidelines, watching the gun garner a variety of awards&mdash;including an American Rifleman Golden Bullseye. A <a title="Check out the Gun of the Week on the Versa Max Tactical. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/videos/gotw-remington-versa-max/?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_content=video2&amp;utm_campaign=HomeTrack1" target="_blank">Versa Max Tactical</a> finally appeared in 2011, premiering with a 7+1 capacity that&rsquo;s been increased to 8+1, and it&rsquo;s hard find a 3-gun match without a few of them in the hands of competitors. </p><p>Despite still employing the Versaport system, it is important to note the Tactical version no longer digests 3 &frac12;-inch shotshells. Some claim it can if ammunition is used that doesn&rsquo;t crimp in the longer tube magazine, but Remington does not list the shotgun as being capable of taking the longer loads, so why risk voiding the two-year warranty. Besides, in competition and home-defense where follow-up shots are important, there&rsquo;s not much reason to shoot 3 &frac12;-inch loads.</p><p>With a 22-inch barrel and an overall length of 43 15/16 inches, the Versa Max Tactical hardly qualifies as nimble. It is, however deliberate and smooth, lending itself to a 3-gun technique whereupon competitors often hold their support hand on a section of fore-end in another zip code as they drive from target to target. With some forethought and practice, however, moving through a darkened house as you work your way to your safe room can also be fast and efficient with this shotgun. Just don&rsquo;t expect movements to be as intuitive as with a short 870.</p><p>That said, the Versa Max Tactical has something shorter pump-actions don&rsquo;t have&mdash;less recoil, much less. Semi-automatic operation has a lot to do with it, but even when testing buckshot loads this shotgun was positively tame. An overall weight of 7.5 pounds also helps, along with a recoil pad specifically designed for this shotgun that drinks energy faster than sorority girls down jello shooters on spring break. </p><p>Adding to overall comfort are three polymer spacers provided that allow shooters to tailor the gun to their preferred length of pull in &frac14;-inch increments, up to as much as 1 inch. The stock gun comes with a 14 &frac14;-inch length-of-pull, and in testing it was comfortable enough that no adjustment was made. A soft insert at the comb minimizes the chances of discomfort being transmitted to your cheek. Drop at comb is 1 7/16 inches and a different height insert is provided to customize fit. Heel drop and cast is easily modified by replacing the stock cast plate with the included alternate version. </p><p>But, there are more pieces in the box than most beginner Lego sets. If you&rsquo;re not fond of the green fiber-optic <a href="http://www.hivizsights.com/" target="_blank">HiViz</a> element in the front sight, simply swap to the red or white versions provided. Want a small rail up front for a laser or light? It&rsquo;s included, too. Simply place it on either side of the barrel ring and tighten. The sling stud can be moved to the other side of the barrel if you still want it attached. </p><p>Sighting on the Versa Max Tactical, as it comes from the factory, is by a mid-bead along the vented rib and the front fiber-optic element. The tapped receiver, however, allows you to easily mount the provided 6-inch section of rail, followed by aftermarket red dots, reflex sights or whatever your heart desires. During testing the stock setup was maintained, but the rail will go on instantly if I decide to give this gun a home. </p><p>The shotgun comes with improved cylinder and Tactical Extended choke tubes. Performance was impressive with both. With <a href="http://www.hornady.com/" target="_blank">Hornady&rsquo;s</a> OO Buck/TAP FPD load, average buckshot spread was 1.372 inches at 7 yards with the improved cylinder choke. With the same setup and distance, Remington No. 7 &frac12; Game Loads had pellets covering 5.287 inches. At 7 yards, about the distance encountered in most home invasions, both shotshells put their entire payloads in center mass, with the TAP punching an intimidatingly small circle in the B27 target. A choke-removal tool is also provided to swap out the ProBore-threaded tubes. </p><p>The Tactical Extended choke gives the shotgun a more aggressive profile, but adds another 1.93 toothy inches to overall length. With it installed, average buckshot spread remained about the same (with the wad punching through the paper at this distance, accurate measurement was pretty dicey), perhaps a little tighter. The birdshot pattern, however, widened by &frac12; inch with the pellets distributed more evenly throughout the entire area. That&rsquo;s a good thing. </p><p>Function testing was conducted by randomly alternating 2 &frac34;-inch and 3-inch loads, and it never experienced a hiccup. The carrier smoothly fed the different length shotshells, ejection was flawless and recoil was negligible. </p><p>Fire controls are also well thought out and designed to ease operation under stress. A generous trigger guard ensures manipulation of the trigger even when wearing gloves and oversized safety and bolt-release buttons can be located easily in the dark. Extending nearly a full inch from the receiver, it would be nearly impossible to lose traction on this operating handle, even with mittens. </p><p>Wet weather wasn&rsquo;t given much thought in regard to purchase on the trigger, though. It&rsquo;s smooth and untreated texture could be a concern were this a rifle, but it&rsquo;s not. Let-off weight measured consistently at 7 pounds and there was no creep. </p><p>About the only serious complaint I have on the Versa Max Tactical is a common one with shotguns&mdash;the carrier is a real nail biter when you&rsquo;re in a hurry. It&rsquo;s little wonder 3-gun competitors either have it modified or carry a box of pre-emptive Band-Aids. Trying to reload fast was painful on several occasions when I tried to pick up the pace. </p><p>Bear in mind, too, the 8+1 capacity is for 2 &frac34;-inch shotshells. With 3-inchers, it drops to 7+1, although I came so close to stuffing eight into the magazine that someone, sooner or later, will apply enough pressure to do so and probably spend the afternoon field stripping the gun to get it running again. Stop after you&rsquo;ve stuffed seven 3 inchers. You&rsquo;ll be glad you did. </p><p>If you&rsquo;re getting your feet wet in 3-gun competition, or looking for a home-defense shotgun that comes with all the right gear, take a close look at Remington&rsquo;s Versa Max Tactical. I&rsquo;m not the only one who is impressed with the reliable shotgun. Here&rsquo;s American Hunter&rsquo;s Jeff Johnston with a video report. It&rsquo;s soft shooting, accurate, customizable and extremely reliable. At $1,399 it&rsquo;s more expensive than a pump-action alternative, but it&rsquo;s vastly more versatile, probably why it&rsquo;s called the Versa Max. </p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Remington; <a href="http://www.remington.com/" target="_blank">Remington.com</a><br /><strong>Model:</strong> Versa Max Tactical<br /><strong>Action:</strong> Gas-Operated Semi-Automatic<br /><strong>Gauge:</strong> 12, 2 &frac34;-and 3-inch shotshells<br /><strong>Finish:</strong> Matte Black<br /><strong>Stock:</strong> Black Synthetic <br /><strong>Length of Pull:</strong> 14&frac12;&rdquo; to 15&frac12;&rdquo;<br /><strong>Sights:</strong> Mid Bead, Fiber Optic Front Sight, Picatinny Rail Provided for the Tapped Receiver<br /><strong>Barrel Length:</strong> 22&rdquo;<br /><strong>Overall Length:</strong> 43 15/16&rdquo;<br /><strong>Choke: </strong>ProBore Improved Cylinder, Tactical Extended<br /><strong>Capacity:</strong> 8+1 2 &frac34;&rdquo;; 7+1 3&rdquo; Shells<br /><strong>Weight:</strong> 7.5 lbs.<br /><strong>Suggested Retail Price:</strong> $1,399</p><p>View the Remington Versa Max Tactical <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/GalleryItem.aspx?cid=22&amp;gid=252&amp;id=2323" target="_blank">Photo Gallery</a><br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[SIG Sauer 556R]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>6/11/2013</em><br /></p><p>With a history dating back to just after the end of World War II as the standard military platform used by the former Soviet Union, the AK-47 served as a symbol of communist aggression behind the Iron Curtain. Considered one of the earliest assault rifles, the AK, and its variants, is chambered in 7.62x39 mm, and while it has been accused of being ugly, it is extremely reliable. </p><p>There are many countries where the AK and its chambering is still in use, though some have relegated both to reserve status, preferring to use standard NATO rifle and cartridge designations. There are, however, untold amounts of military surplus 7.62x39 mm ammunition, making it one of the most commonly available rounds in the world. Because of this manufacturers have entered into this market and developed rifles in this chambering, such as the <a href="https://www.sigsauer.com/">SIG Sauer</a> 556R. </p><p>The 556R is built on the same rotary bolt, two-position adjustable-gas piston system as the 5.56x45 mm versions that have been available since shortly after SIG built its New Hampshire plant. The two-position gas valve allows the gun to be adjusted to continue running when dirty or being used in adverse conditions. This system also allows the stock to be folded toward the ejection port, without blocking the port during firing, to provide a more compact rifle platform for use in tight spaces, while also offering a full-length stock that can be quickly flipped into place for more support. </p><p>The forearm, butt stock and pistol grip of the 556R are made of black polymer, while the metal components are covered in a matte-black finish that is evenly applied, providing coverage and protection for all parts. Some of the well-thought-out extras include an ambidextrous safety, a spring-loaded trigger guard for accommodating gloved fingers and storage in the pistol grip. </p><p>Disassembly is simple, though it does include numerous steps. First, remove the AK-style magazine and ensure the firearm is unloaded. Then press the rear take-down pin from the left side and pull it to the right until it stops before pressing the pivot pin in the same way. From here the top receiver will lift off of the trigger housing. Depress the charging handle catch and remove the charging handle. Use the charging handle to push the bolt carrier to the rear and remove it from the receiver. Rotate the bolt head counterclockwise until the lug clears the cam and separate the units. Remove the firing pin from the bolt head by depressing the pin and knocking out the stud with a punch (be careful not to let the firing pin shoot out under pressure from the spring). </p><p>The dual-piece forearm is removed by pulling back and down on the lower piece and lifting the upper away from the gas block. Remove the gas valve by depressing the pin on the left side and rotating the unit to the left and removing, which allows the operating rod assembly to come out. Then, depress the pin on the left again and rotate the gas tube 90 degrees and lift. Anything further should be done by a qualified gunsmith. Reassembly is done in reverse. </p><p>Once back together, SIG recommends a function test by, once again, ensuring the rifle is unloaded and pulling the reciprocating charging handle to the rear and allowing it to go back into battery. Put the safety lever on &ldquo;safe&rdquo; and pull the trigger. The hammer should not drop. Turn the lever to &ldquo;fire&rdquo; and pull the trigger. The hammer should fall. Finally, hold the trigger to the rear and cycle the charging handle. The hammer should not drop when the gun returns to battery, but should when the trigger is released and pressed. </p><p>Range work began with the included SIG Sauer red-dot optic. The red dot was easy to mount and sight in, and exhibited decent self-defense accuracy. At ranges between 25 and 100 yards, center mass hits were obtained during drills, and groups shrank considerably when using supported shooting positions, such as <a title="Check out this story on alternative shooting positions. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/alternative-shooting-positions/" target="_blank">kneeling, prone and barrier</a>. However, since the optic is only 1X, I would have preferred iron sights for durability and to eliminate the need for a battery. SIG Sauer offers aftermarket iron sights, as do some other companies, but they don&rsquo;t come standard. </p><p>Its unloaded weight of 7 pounds and mild 7.62x39 mm chambering, provided very little recoil and allowed fast follow-up shots during multiple target strings. Even when firing with the butt stock in its forward position recoil was manageable, though accuracy suffered greatly, and the rifle ran with zero problems throughout testing. The trigger, however, was of the typical battle type, with significant take up and a fairly heavy trigger pull at just over 7 pounds. The pistol grip was comfortable and fits most hands well, though smaller hands might have a problem reaching the safety mechanism, and the forearm was easy to hold and never became hot, regardless of the number of rounds fired. </p><p>For formal accuracy testing, I mounted a <a href="http://nightforceoptics.com/" target="_blank">Night Force</a> 2.5-10x24 NSX riflescope on quick-detach mounts and settled the gun into a <a href="http://www.battenfeldtechnologies.com/caldwell/" target="_blank">Caldwell</a> Fire Control rest with two <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester</a> loads and one <a href="http://tulammousa.com/" target="_blank">Tula</a> steel-case load. Accuracy was decent, but not spectacular in five-shot groups with the Winchester 123-grain soft point loads averaging 2.34 inches and the Winchester 123-grain FMJ averaging 2.5 inches. However, I noticed throughout the process that three-shot groups stayed right at the 1-inch mark, with the fourth and fifth shots adding significant spreading in the groups. In a couple of groups, it was the fifth round that increased the spread. The Tula 122-grain FMJ load fared similarly with multiple three-shot groups measuring just a little over an inch, while five-shot groups spread out into the 2 and 3 inch ranges. The Winchester soft points had multiple, three-shot groups that measured under an inch, and was determined as the best load during the testing procedures. </p><p>The 556R comes with a single 30-round magazine of the AK variety. It is made of polymer in Bulgaria, and was easy to work with throughout testing, securely fitting into the magazine well, with fast removal. The magazine was quite durable as it was dropped several times during testing, and showing no sign of breakage, and like the AK, the bolt doesn&rsquo;t lock open on the magazine with the last round. Since most standard AK magazines should work with the 556R, only one metal magazine was tested, the lack of an additional magazine isn&rsquo;t a huge problem, but it would be nice to have at least a second magazine come with the rifle. </p><p>Overall, the SIG Sauer 556R performed admirably, and is excellent for what it is intended&mdash;a better-made rifle for firing the 7.62x39 mm caliber round. It is a fighting and self-defense rifle, not a sub-m.o.a. precision rifle. It is fun to shoot, and would work well on large targets out to a few hundred yards, while excelling on fast-action, close-range targets, with what could arguably be the most plentiful round in the world. </p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> SIG Sauer; <a href="https://www.sigsauer.com/" target="_blank">www.sigsauer.com</a><br /><strong>Caliber:</strong> 7.62x39 mm<br /><strong>Action:</strong> semi-auto, rotary bolt, two-position adjustable-gas piston<br /><strong>Receiver:</strong> aluminum<br /><strong>Barrel:</strong> 16&rdquo;<br /><strong>Rifling:</strong> 1:9.5&rdquo; RH twist<br /><strong>Magazine:</strong> single 30-round polymer<br /><strong>Sights: </strong>none; mini red-dot sight<br /><strong>Trigger:</strong> 7.15 lbs. <br /><strong>Stock:</strong> polymer<br /><strong>Overall Length:</strong> 35.875&rdquo;; folded 26&rdquo;<br /><strong>Weight:</strong> 7 lbs. without magazine<br /><strong>Accessories:</strong> lock; 1&rdquo; butt plate extension; hand guard rail kit for mounting accessories<br /><strong>Suggested Retail Price:</strong> $1332</p><p><img title="SIG Sauer 556R" src="../../Webcontent/gallery/251/2030SIGSAUER556R_web.jpg" alt="SIG Sauer 556R" width="644" height="329" /><br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Charlie Blackmore was driving home around 4 a.m. when he spotted a woman being assaulted along the side of the road. A man had pushed her to the ground and was kicking her repeatedly in the head and stomach. Blackmore stopped his car and ordered the man to stop the attack. The assailant then turned his attention to Blackmore and began approaching him. Thanks to Wisconsin's new concealed-carry law, Blackmore was able to draw his pistol and hold the suspect at gunpoint until police arrived. The woman was treated for what appeared to be a broken nose and large laceration on her face. (<a href="http://www.TheBlaze.com" target="_blank"><em>TheBlaze.com</em></a>, West Allis, WI, 3/15/13)</p><p>A gunman entered a Philadelphia deli shortly after 6 p.m. on Tuesday, police said, where he drew a weapon and went behind the counter to where the owner's wife was standing. Pointing the gun to her chest, he forced her to her knees and ordered her to open the cash register. As she started taking the money out, she screamed for her husband, who came out from a back room with his gun. The gunman shot at the owner, missing him, and the owner fired back three times, fatally wounding him. "If my husband hadn't shot him, he would have been shot," said the wife. The owner agreed, "I didn't want it to come to that," he said. "But we had to defend ourselves."

              <title><![CDATA[A Great Gun Store]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>For some reason, I have lately been reflecting on a lifetime of shooting, which includes the fine gun people I&rsquo;ve met and the great gun places I have visited. I found both in the old San Francisco Gun Exchange. The store has been out of business since September of &rsquo;99, but it was an iconic institution for the 52 years preceding that unhappy date. Those who study marketing would be well advised to examine the way that grand old store was run. They had what you needed (as well as most competing products), their sales people knew a great deal about the product and the sale was completely honest and above board. It was a dignified, yet cordial atmosphere, and for most of the five-plus decades the SFGE was in business, owner Nate Posner worked hard to keep it that way.</p><p>I was introduced to Nate Posner sometime in the mid 70s, just as he was getting into the custom knife business. Over the years that followed, I bought several guns and a great many books, accessories and the like from the friendly guy behind that wide counter at the right rear of a big store. As stores go, this one was magnificent. The ceiling was two stories high with mezzanine facings decorated with DeWats&mdash;ever seen an Ingram Model 6 in .38 Super? Arranged in a big &ldquo;U&rdquo; shape with gun cases against the walls and accessories in the middle, the main floor was a gun buff&rsquo;s dream. Virtually everything made and worth having was arrayed in glass showcases or open racks behind the counters. As you came through the front door, you were faced with a five-foot high Lucite case stuffed with single round samples of collector&rsquo;s ammo. I once bought a single round of 9 mm Mauser, a pre-WWI cartridge for the C/96 pistol, from that case. Knives, custom and otherwise, were stored over on the left. </p><p>When it came to gun stuff, Nate Posner had it all. However, it was not so much that he was exceptionally well-stocked, but rather the way he conducted business that made the old store so great. In those days the big &lsquo;Smiths were in short supply and you had to pony up some big bucks for them. osner never asked a dime over suggested retail and sold more guns because of it. He was as straight as a ruler and conveyed that characteristic to a son and daughter who continued to run the business when Nate could no longer handle it. Eventually, an unfriendly regime in the city government created a special tax schedule for gun stores. By this decree, gun stores paid something on the order of twenty times the tax rate of bicycle shops, drug stores, bakeries or what have you down the street. In plain words, they were eventually nagged out of business. More than anything else, I miss the atmosphere of that old shop. The clientele was generally urban professionals, cops, genuine sportsmen and even a politician or two. It was a place for people who just liked guns.<br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

LaserMax claims that this enables a shooter to operate from concealment without risking a potentially dangerous reveal of his or her position.</p><p>Placement of the laser and switch also reinforce the NRA's rules for safe handling of firearms and prevent any potential blocking of the beam, which is emitted from directly under bore for accuracy.</p><p>"Each CenterFire sports a minimalist design that mirrors the color, texture and styling of the firearm it is designed around," said Kurt Worden, LaserMax vp of Commercial Sales. "Kahr pistols were a natural area of expansion in this rapidly growing family and we are pleased to be meeting an established market demand."</p><p>The CenterFire can be installed in minutes and comes pre-aligned for 10 yards, but allows fine adjustment to be made to both windage and elevation with a supplied hex tool. The single 1/3N lithium battery provides over four hours of continuous runtime. Suggested retail price is $129.</p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>By Paul Rackley</p><p>This season, Top Shot producers introduced the trick shooting a little early, and it threw an interesting twist into the show, sending home a strong shooter. </p><p>For the challenge, the remaining 15 shooters were split into three teams and required to perform five shots from the pages of history, including Annie Oakley&rsquo;s famous mirror shot. Each person on a team tried his or her hand on one of the shots that consisted of shooting corncob pipes out of a mannequin&rsquo;s mouth, knocking down a middle bowling pin without hitting the two outside pins, shooting a paint can in the air and spitting a .45 caliber bullet on an axe to pop a balloon on each side. </p><p>Once again, one of my favorites was dissed by being picked last for the teams, but Franks eventually has to gain some respect as he was the only shooter on the paint cans to hit three for three, including action-pistol expert Blake Miguez. </p><p>The competition was pretty close throughout the challenge, but the win eventually went to the Red Team, which sent the Blue Team of William, Blake, Gabby, Kelly and Kyle to the Proving Ground where they used an 1860 Henry to determine that Blake Miguez and Kyle Sumpter would face off in the Elimination Challenge. It looks as if the Proving Ground will feature a different firearm from history each week. </p><p>The Elimination Challenge also featured trick shots, and consisted of hitting three bottles with an upside down Smith &amp; Wesson 686, three gumballs with a Volquartsen .22 and two plates simultaneously with two Ruger Security Sixes. In the challenge, neither did great with the event ending in a tie, which forced a tie-breaker of once again taking aim at the gumballs. Blake has serious issues with the Volquartsen, as he missed three for three gumballs, the same as he did is his first try, which sent him home early and ended his chance to become History&rsquo;s Top Shot. </p><p>The show continued to eliminate the human-drama factor, showing the house only at the very beginning and during the packing. I&rsquo;m still loving this new format, which is all about the shooting skill of the competitors, mirroring the way that shooters fire their last shot. <br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><em>6/5/2013</em></p><p>As a soldier and civilian shooter, I’ve had plenty of practice disassembling, cleaning and maintaining M4- and AR-style rifles. Many times I've seen young soldiers take knives to their rifle’s bolt assemblies, trying to scratch off the tough, caked-on carbon. It made me cringe a bit, but given a standard G.I. cleaning kit and basic CLP solution, they really didn’t have other options available in the field. </p><p>Times have changed. New for 2013, Otis Technology has introduced the B.O.N.E. Tool, the first tool specifically designed to clean the bolt assembly components of an AR-style rifle. CNC-machined from 1144 steel, the B.O.N.E. Tool has built-in scrapers designed to remove carbon fouling from the bolt, bolt carrier and firing pin. As well, it includes an 8-32 threaded hole so it can act as a T-handle for conventional cleaning rods. Its 25⁄8x5/8-inch dimensions make it is easy to store and transport, even in a pistol grip compartment. </p><p>Guaranteed for life, this product should become a staple of AR cleaning and repair kits, and it is my hope they become standard-issue among military and law enforcement. Price: $25. </p><p><strong>Contact:</strong> Otis Technology; (800) 684-7486; <a href="http://www.otistec.com/" target="_blank">www.otistec.com</a>.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Ruger SR45 Pistol ]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><em>6/5/2013</em></p><p>Right now one of the most popular choices in personal-defense firearms is the polymer-framed, striker-fired semi-auto pistol. Modern designs of this handgun type have proven to be lightweight, easy to operate and reliable. Introduced in 2007, <a href="http://www.ruger.com/index.html" target="_blank">Ruger's</a> line of SR semi-autos, such as the <a title="Read Wiley Clapp's review. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/Ruger-SR9s/" target="_blank">SR9</a> and <a title="Read the full review of the SR40. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/ruger-sr40c-review/" target="_blank">SR40</a>, has become a popular choice for modern pistol owners. This year the company is adding an eagerly anticipated version of this pistol chambered in the all-American .45 ACP, aptly named the SR45. </p><p>One trait that makes the SR pistol series likable right out of the box is the styling. I heard one shooting expert call a particularly famous line of striker-fired pistols "soul-less guns." Needless to say, plenty of plastic pistols, while reliable, aren't exactly easy on the eyes. The SR45, on the other hand, is a two-tone semi-auto showing sleek lines with some thoughtful touches. </p><p>Like the other SR pistols I've handled, the fit and finish of the SR45 was top notch. The slide is rounded (not square) with polished flats and a satin top. The muzzle end of the slide is nicely curved and cut. A loaded chamber indicator on the top of the slide provides both visual and tactile indicators when a cartridge is in the pipe. The blued-steel Novak sights are of the three-dot variety with an adjustable rear sight. The stainless-steel barrel is 4.5-inches, with traditional six land-and-groove rifling that will work with all bullet types, including cast lead.</p><p>Removing the slide reveals a recoil assembly consisting of a flat-wire spring captured on a polymer guide rod by a metallic rod base. The slide rides on aluminum rail support blocks molded into the high-performance, glass-filled nylon grip frame. The trigger and ambidextrous magazine release are also nylon. The external safeties of the SR45 include a trigger safety and an ambidextrous thumb safety. The thumb safety blocks both the slide and trigger from cycling. </p><p>Translating a successful pistol design to accommodate a larger caliber is not always a successful process when it comes to handling qualities. For those with smaller hands, holding a double-stack .45 can feel like squeezing a 2x4. Although dimensional changes to the SR45 frame were necessary, Ruger did a good job of keeping the pistol's grip shape hand friendly.  </p><p>Rather than fattening the grip to brick-like proportions to accommodate a 13- or 14-round magazine, this one was slimmed down to a comfortable 10-round capacity. The top of the grip frame is rounded with a generous beavertail extension to protect the shooting hand from slide bite. The grip is checkered on the front and sides for positive purchase. Half-moon dimples, extending from the magazine release to the opening of the magazine well on each side of the grip make it feel even slimmer. The back strap is a soft rubber strip that can be removed and flipped over to give the user a choice between a straight backstrap, similar to a 1911, or a bit of a palm swell. </p><p>At the shooting range, the SR45’s grip design, barrel length and 30.15 ounces of weight worked together to keep the muzzle flip controllable. The pistol reliably fed, fired and ejected a variety of practice- and defense-grade .45 ACP loads. The reliability needed for a defensive pistol was right where it needed to be. Formal accuracy testing, conducted from the bench at 25 yards, kept five-shot group sizes right at the 2.5- to 3-inch mark, demonstrating solid accuracy as well.</p><p>The ambidextrous magazine release is a good size and can be reliably operated from the right or left side with either a thumb or index finger. The slide stop and thumb safety are sleek and small, especially if you are used to the boat-paddle shaped safety of a modern 1911. Although the thumb safety was easy to disengage with a downward sweep of the shooting hand thumb, it was fairly tough to re-engage in the same manner. Again, 1911-ers may not like it much. </p><p>The trigger proved to be quite good, but a bit different from what might be expected in a striker-fired pistol. It was smooth and grit-free in its operation, tipping the digital trigger gauge at 6 pounds, 8 ounces. This would be a bit heavy for this kind of gun except for its relatively short travel distance and crisp break. What makes it unusual is the lack of play in the trigger. Many pistol triggers can be pulled part way through their arch of travel and then released without the gun firing. Some shooters prefer this freedom of movement in case a “shoot” scenario suddenly changes to a “no shoot” situation. With the SR45, the trigger starts right at the break point. This means that once the short trigger stroke begins, the gun goes off. This trigger design resulted in easier accuracy at the range, but it would need to be treated like a light single-action trigger in the field. </p><p>Since the SR45 is a duty-size pistol with more than an inch of tactical rail space, it provided a good opportunity to test drive the new TLR-2 HL laser/light module from <a href="http://www.streamlight.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Streamlight</a>. The HL in the name stands for high lumen, and they're not kidding. The C4 LED technology combined with a TIR optic produces a concentrated 630 lumen beam. A toggle switch allows the user to switch quickly between this blinding light source, a bright 640-660nm red laser or to use both at the same time. Two 3-volt CR123 lithium batteries keep the light running for 1.25 hours, or the laser only for up to 45 hours. </p><p>As accurate and reliable as this pistol, caliber and laser/light combo proved to be, it may seem too big for concealed carry. The good news is that <a href="http://holstercollection.com/main.sc" target="_blank">Springtac Holsters</a> continues to expand its holster systems for accessorized handguns. Springtac recently released a modular shoulder holster harness that not only makes it possible to carry a full-size gun with a laser/light unit attached, but to do so painlessly as well. The harness supports Springtac’s 3 inch and 5 inch standard belt holsters. The holster just snaps into place. A stiff support arm located under the holster transmits much of the pistol's weight to the user’s belt, which significantly reduces the pressure on the neck and shoulders. This system is fully ambidextrous and can be configured to support one pistol, a pistol and spare magazines or two pistols. It was surprisingly comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. </p><p>Ever since the first SR 9 mm pistol hit the market a few years ago, customers have been asking for a version in .45 ACP. The SR45 does not disappoint. The accuracy is better than one would expect from an off-the-shelf polymer-frame pistol, and the SR45 proved to be reliable with a variety of ammunition. The attention to ergonomic and cosmetic details makes this a .45 that is merciful to aesthetic sensibilities as well as to shooter's hands and wrists. The SR45 is a solid defensive option for both seasoned shooters and those who are just getting started. </p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co., Inc.; <a href="http://www.ruger.com/index.html" target="_blank">www.ruger.com</a></p><p><strong>Model:</strong> SR45</p><p><strong>Action:</strong> Striker-fired double-action only</p><p><strong>Caliber:</strong> .45 ACP</p><p><strong>Slide:</strong> Brushed stainless steel or black nitride alloy steel</p><p><strong>Grip Frame: </strong>High-performance, glass-filled nylon</p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> Adjustable three-dot</p><p><strong>Barrel Length:</strong> 4.5”</p><p><strong>Overall Length:</strong> 8”</p><p><strong>Height:</strong> 5.75”</p><p><strong>Width:</strong> 1.27”</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 30.15 ozs.</p><p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 10+1 rounds</p><p><strong>Twist: </strong>1:16” RH</p><p><strong>Rifle Grooves:</strong> 6</p><p><strong>Accessories:</strong> Two 10-round magazines, magazine loader, hard case, lock, manual</p><p><strong>Suggested Retail Price:</strong> $529</p><p><img title="SR45 Shooting Results" src="../../Webcontent/gallery/250/2024NRA_ARW_SR45s_web.jpg" alt="SR45 Shooting Results" width="644" height="413" /></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>In a recent home assault, a homeowner fought off two armed assailants without receiving an injury. According to the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/06/05/louisiana-homeowner-fatally-shoots-armed-home-intruder-police-say/?test=latestnews" target="_blank">news report</a>, the Lafayette, La., man stopped the attackers at the door by exchanging gunfire with the pair. </p><p>As there were two, both with firearms, it is my assumption that the homeowner had a good cover location from which to defend his home. It is a good idea to pre-plan several cover locations from which you can defend, as most homes have multiple points for access. This means that you should determine potential cover, something that can stop a bullet, throughout your home. </p><p>You can even move items, such as a bookcase full of books, to provide defensive zones. Of course, concealment, such as furniture, is better than nothing as it can provide for a surprise attack that forces the assailants to flee, but understand that hiding behind a chair or a couch leaves you venerable to a determined attacker. </p><p>I personally have three locations scouted that provide cover against anyone trying to enter through my exterior doors on the lower level. Unfortunately, my upper level has more concealment than cover at the present time, but I&rsquo;m looking into improving this deficiency. </p><p>A good home-defense plan is the best way to ward off a home invasion, and this includes areas from which you can safely defend. Take a look at your home and see where you can improve you cover.</p></p>]]></bodyContent>

Underwood retrieved a gun she kept in her bedroom and returned to find a 26-year-old man who had broken the window and gained entry to her home. Underwood ordered the man to get out of her home and leave her alone. Instead the man walked into another room, then walked back toward her. Underwood warned the man to stop and when he didn't she pulled the trigger. The gun misfired, So Underwood fired again and missed. The man got down on the floor to avoid being shot. Underwood held the man there until police arrived. (<a href="http://www.tribtoday.com/" target="_blank"><em>Tribune Chronicle</em></a>, Youngstown, OH, 3/29/13) </p><p>A father eating with his family at Burger King was able to defeat an armed robber by using his firearm. It was 1 p.m. when a would be robber walked into Burger King, flashed his gun at one of the diners and demanded the diner fork over money and valuables, Miami police said in a CBS report. The robber was exiting when the father, who feared for his and his family's lives, CBS said, took out his gun and shot the suspect in the leg. The suspect then fled, and was later found by police. He was taken to the hospital for treatment and charged with three counts of armed robbery, according to police. (<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/" target="_blank"><em>Washington Times</em></a>, Miami, FL, 4/8/13)</p><p><strong>From The Armed Citizen Archives</strong></p><p><em>August 1971: </em>A young mother who killed a 37-year-old felon after he forced his way into her home was cleared of manslaughter charges by District Court Judge Robert Simms in Tulsa, Okla. Mrs. Keith Boyce, alone with her nine-month-old baby in a home that had been burglarized twice before, shot the intruder with a .22 pistol while holding her baby in her other arm. Judge Simms approved. "If more people did this," he said, "we would have less of the problem we have in this country." The slain man had a 20-year record of major crime, and was free on bond on a burglary charge when shot.

              <title><![CDATA[New Propellants Energize the .223 Rem. ]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>6/12/2013</em><br /></p><p>Handloaders always welcome new propellants in their efforts to improve the velocity and accuracy of their loads. So, in anticipation of stepping up the performance of my .223 Rem. handloads, I&rsquo;ve been using several new propellants from <a href="http://www.alliantpowder.com/" target="_blank">Alliant</a> and <a href="http://www.hodgdon.com/" target="_blank">Hodgdon</a>, including Alliant&rsquo;s AR-Comp and Power Pro series of Varmint, 1200-R and 2000-MR and Hodgdon&rsquo;s CFE 223. A few of these work well with the complete range of 0.224-inch bullets, while a couple others are restricted to a narrower range of weights.</p><p><strong>Loading Lots</strong><br />To speed up the .223 Rem. loading process I use propellants that meter precisely. Four of these new options have fine spherical-shaped granules and in five charges dropped from a measure they varied at the most 0.10 of a grain in weight. AR-Comp is a cylindrical propellant with short and thin kernels, and it varied 0.20 of a grain over five thrown charges. Still, its extreme spread of velocity of 42 fps was actually the narrowest of the five propellants over 10 shots.</p><p><strong>1200-R</strong><br />Alliant states that a maximum charge of 1200-R imparts a velocity of ,3805 fps to 40-grain bullets. The 24-inch barrel of my much-fired Remington Model 700 SPS launched Hornady 40-grain V-MAX bullets at slightly more than 3,700 fps with that maximum 26.8 grains of 1200-R. That&rsquo;s about the fastest I&rsquo;ve been able to fire that weight bullet with any of a dozen propellants loaded in the .223 Rem. </p><p><strong>Varmint</strong><br />Varmint has a slightly slower burn rate than 1200-R, which makes it useful in the .223 Rem. loaded with 40- to 55-grain bullets. I was a bit disappointed, though, with chronograph readings from four .223 Rem.-chambered rifles that were 200 to nearly 400 fps slower than the velocities Alliant states for Varmint. Alliant lists 50-grain bullets at 3,377 fps with 26.3 grains of Varmint and 3,700 fps for 40-grain bullets with 27.9 grains of the propellant. The Remington&rsquo;s 24-inch barrel turned in 3,131 fps with 50-grain bullets using 26.3 grains of the propellant, and 40 grainers reached 3,276 fps with 27.5 grains of Varmint. That 40-grain combination lost only 90 fps when fired through a 20-inch barrel.</p><p><strong>AR-Comp</strong><br />According to Alliant, its AR-Comp provides consistent pressures and velocities whether the season is searing summer or arctic winter. The extreme spread of velocity for 10 shots was only 42 fps shooting AR-Comp with Berger 52-grain bullets on a 30 degree F day. Velocity was entirely acceptable at 3,302 fps. Accuracy was great, too, with five-shot groups at 100 yards as tight as 0.58 inches from the Remington SPS&rsquo;s pencil-thin barrel. Here&rsquo;s a winter winner. </p><p><strong>CFE 223</strong><br />This propellant reduces copper fouling by depositing an ingredient that shields the pores of the metal in the bore, hence the name Copper Fouling Eraser. That means little to me because I reach for a cleaning rod and solvent at the mere glimpse of a dirty bore. However, I am partial to CFE 223 for its good accuracy and the fairly high velocities it gave 55-grain bullets fired from the .223 Rem. My Savage Model 10 grouped five Nosler 55-grain Varmageddon bullets as tight as 0.54 inches at 100 yards. When propelled by 28.0 grains of CFE 223 the Varmageddon&rsquo;s velocity of 3,173 fps was on par for the top speeds of other propellants fired from my Savage&rsquo;s 22-inch barrel, but less than the 3,292 fps reached with a 24-inch barrel used in the Nosler Reloading Guide 7. </p><p>CFE 223 didn&rsquo;t show all that much loss of bullet velocity when shot from shorter barrels. Hornady 55-grain V-MAX bullets, with an average velocity of 3,067 fps fired with 27.5 grains of CFE 223 from the Savage&rsquo;s 22-inch barrel, lost only 32 fps from a 20-inch barrel and about 200 fps from a 6-inch-shorter, 16-inch barrel of a JARD J16 autoloader.</p><p>The Savage&rsquo;s 1:9-inch twist barrel is not supposed to stabilize Sierra 77-grain MatchKing bullets, but it did with CFE 223, and five groups averaged 0.63 inches at 100 yards. Velocity came up a bit short of Hodgdon&rsquo;s stated 2,811 fps. But a little velocity in exchange for a great measure of accuracy is always a good swap. </p><p><strong>2000-Medium Rifle</strong><br />Alliant&rsquo;s 2000-MR is a relatively slow-burning propellant best matched with 68-grain and heavier bullets. A maximum load of 26.6 grains of the propellant produced a velocity slightly higher than 2,800 fps with Sierra 69-grain MatchKing bullets when shot from my Savage rifle. That was a bit slow compared to Alliant&rsquo;s results of 3,070 fps. </p><p>The maximum amount of 2000-MR filled cases to the bottom of the neck, thereby resulting in a slightly compressed charge when seating Sierra bullets to a cartridge overall length of 2.260 inches. After doing so, that tight propellant column no doubt was responsible for an extreme spread of velocity of 55 fps over 10 shots. Groups, though, had a nice, round shape. One Sierra hit a smidgen high from one group and another landed a tad low from another group. But chronograph readings showed the velocities of the two bullets were close to average. I&rsquo;m to blame for their waywardness. Had I not sent the two bullets on the wrong course, the 2000-MR and MatchKing combination would have rivaled the accuracy of any of the loads tested. </p><p>After firing several hundred .223s loaded with these new propellants, a few recipes are sure keepers. So excuse me as I again retreat to the basement bench to load a few of these propellant and bullet combinations for the .223 Rem. to last the rest of the year.</p><p><img title="223 Rem powder loads" src="../../Webcontent/gallery/253/2038223SelectPowders_web.jpg" alt="223 Rem powder loads" /><br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><em>6/12/2013</em></p><p>Although we have covered the Colt 1903 Pocket Hammerless before, the gun shown here makes it worth revisiting, because it is a classic example of how condition affects value. But first, a brief background on what the Colt factory called its Model M-the company’s first handgun to incorporate a grip safety.</p><p>The John Browning-designed 1903 Pocket Hammerless in .32 ACP chambering was one of Colt’s most popular handguns, with 572,215 made between 1903 and 1945, along with enough parts to keep it in production until 1953. Actually, the gun was not hammerless at all, as its hammer was merely concealed within the frame. Standard finishes were blue or nickel. Early stocks were checkered hard rubber; later guns featured checkered walnut with Colt medallions. In an age when revolvers dominated the handgun scene, the instruction sheet explained that even though the 1903 Pocket Hammerless was an “automatic,” the trigger had to be pulled for each shot, stating “... it is impossible to fire all the shots by pulling the trigger only once.” </p><p>Collectors break down the Model M into five basic variants. The Type I (1903-1908) featured a 4-inch barrel, while the Type II (around 1908-1910) changed to a 3¾-inch barrel. Type III (1910) eliminated the barrel bushing, Type IV (1926) introduced the magazine disconnect, and Type Vs were World War II-production guns, most of which were Parkerized.</p><p>The gun presented here is a Type IV and, looking at its left side, it appears immaculate, complete with two-tone magazine, original box and instruction sheet. But the right side of the slide, frame and trigger guard are deeply pitted. Watermarks on the bottom of the box give further evidence of improper storage. Thus, what was once an NRA Excellent Condition collectable has become an NRA Good Condition shooter. </p><p>To put this in perspective, two years ago at Wally Beinfeld’s Las Vegas Antique Arms Show, an NRA Excellent Condition gun with box and brochure sold for $950. Last year at Beinfeld’s show, the gun depicted here, priced at $750, had no takers. A dealer offered $600, which was refused. This gun finally sold for $650. All of which shows that when buying or selling guns, price guides-as good as they are-do not always represent the absolute word, because visual appeal reigns supreme.</p><p><strong>Gun:</strong> Colt 1903 Pocket Hammerless</p><p><strong>Caliber:</strong> .32 ACP</p><p><strong>Serial No:</strong> 5061XX</p><p><strong>Condition:</strong> NRA Good (Modern Gun Condition Standards)*</p><p><strong>Manufactured:</strong> 1930</p><p><strong>Value:</strong> $650 to $750 (including box and instructions)*</p><p><strong>*Note:</strong> This gun’s otherwise 98 percent NRA Excellent Condition has been dramatically affected by excessive pitting on its right side and slight water damage to the box, which alone carries a value of $150 to $200.</p><p><img title="Colt 1903 Hammerless side" src="../../Webcontent/gallery/253/2038IMG_7561_2_web.jpg" alt="Colt 1903 Hammerless side" width="644" height="412" /></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[The American Longrifle]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>6/12/2013</em><br /></p><p><em>&ldquo;Bemis Heights (Saratoga) 7 Oct., 1777&rdquo; by H. Charles McBarron; Courtesy of the Army Art Collection, U.S. Army Center of Military History</em></p><p>On the morning of Oct. 7, 1777, Timothy Murphy, a Continental Army sergeant and master sniper, loaded a lead ball into his American longrifle while perched in a tree on the edge of the Second Battle of Saratoga in upstate New York. His target was a man on a horse 300 yards distant.</p><p>British troops under the command of Simon Fraser, a Scottish aristocrat and British brigadier general, were rallying on the battlefield for what seemed to be an imminent victory over Colonial troops, a triumph that could put an end to the American Revolution.</p><p>Spotting the British general&rsquo;s success at marshalling his troops for a final attack, Gen. Benedict Arnold, then considered the finest officer in the American army and George Washington&rsquo;s anointed favorite general, called out to Daniel Morgan, commander of an elite brigade of Virginia riflemen: &ldquo;That man on the grey horse is a host unto himself and must be disposed of&mdash;direct the attention of some of the sharpshooters amongst your riflemen to him!&rdquo;</p><p>Colonel Morgan then said to Murphy, one of his finest marksmen, &ldquo;That gallant officer is General Fraser. I admire him, but it is necessary that he should die. Do your duty.&rdquo;</p><p>From his shooting perch in a tree, Murphy pointed his flintlock longrifle at the general, riding on a hill some 300 yards away, and squeezed the trigger.</p><p>As the rifle&rsquo;s hammer dropped, the firearm&rsquo;s surprisingly slow process of ignition unfolded, a fragile, complex procedure that on a flintlock rifle is nowhere near as fast as the firing of a modern cartridge arm. </p><p>When I first fired a vintage, blackpowder flintlock longrifle, I was amazed by two things. As a U.S. Navy SEAL, I was used to handling arms weighing 20 pounds and 40 pounds or more. But the typical American longrifle was around 9 pounds, a sleek, surprisingly lightweight gun, more like a precision combat surgical instrument than a battlefield tool.</p><p>And second, the process of firing the gun is incredibly slow. You line up your shot through the superb sighting system, and pull the trigger. Sparks shower as the flint strikes the frizzen. There&rsquo;s a quick flash as the sparks ignite the powder in the pan, and a delayed sensation of contact in the gun. A little bit of smoke escapes from the pan as it ignites. A flash of flame passes through a hole into the breech of the barrel, which kicks off the powder charge behind the patched lead ball. Then a big puff of grayish smoke blasts out of the end of the barrel and the smoke fills the shooter&rsquo;s whole field of vision. The rifle is so light that, rather than a sharp rap, the recoil feels more like a push against the shoulder. </p><p>If the wind was right, and if he&rsquo;d used enough blackpowder for the ball to travel faster than sound, Murphy might have heard dull cracks from sonic reflections echoing back as the projectile passed the nearby trees. Meanwhile, the bullet continued toward the British general. </p><p>Throughout the war, British officers were horrified to see American riflemen like Murphy intentionally aiming at enemy officers as a way of decapitating the opposing leadership, as well as aiming at other strategic targets of opportunity such as Native American guides and British artillerymen. In the earlier combat at Saratoga, rebel riflemen hiding in and around trees had shredded the lines of stunned British officers. </p><p>For the American riflemen, the tactics of hit-and-run, concealment, ambush and surprise, and targeted killings were simply smart guerilla tactics. To the Brits, they were war crimes, pure and simple.</p><p>The commanding British general at the battle, Gen. John Burgoyne, who was the boss of Brig. Gen. Fraser at the Battle of Saratoga, later wrote of the sudden deadly impact of the American riflemen: &ldquo;The enemy had with their army great numbers of marksmen, armed with rifle-barrel pieces; these, during an engagement, hovered upon the flanks in small detachments, and were very expert in securing themselves, and in shifting their ground. In this action many placed themselves in high trees in the rear of their own line, and there was seldom a minute&rsquo;s interval of smoke, in any part of our line without officers being taken off by a single shot.&rdquo; </p><p>The British feared the Colonial riflemen so much they called them &ldquo;widow-makers.&rdquo; Indeed the best picture of American riflemen comes from the unfortunate British troops who had to face them in battle. British Capt. Henry Beaufoy wrote that his combat-hardened troops, &ldquo;when they understood they were opposed by riflemen ... felt a degree of terror never inspired by general action, from the idea that a rifleman always singled out an individual, who was almost certain of being killed or wounded.&rdquo; He explained that the Americans &ldquo;were in the habit of forming themselves into small bands often of twelve, who, accustomed to shooting in hunting parties, went out in a sort of predatory warfare, each carrying his ammunition and provisions and returning when he was exhausted. From the incessant attacks of these bodies, their opponents could never be prepared: as the first knowledge of a patrol in the neighbourhood was generally given by a volley of well-directed fire, that perhaps killed or wounded the greater part.&rdquo; </p><p>Col. George Hanger, a British officer who served in South Carolina, was so impressed by the American&rsquo;s deadly skill he wrote to the folks back home: &ldquo;I never in my life saw better rifles (or men who shot better) than those made in America.&rdquo; Another British officer reported that an expert rifleman could hit the head of a man at 200 yards, and if he &ldquo;were to get perfect aim at 300 yards at me, standing still, he would most undoubtedly hit me unless it were a very windy day.&rdquo;</p><p>The British had never heard of such behavior as the deliberate targeting of officers, and they were totally shocked. To them it seemed repulsive, very un-European and a tactic born of sheer cowardice. But their leaders like Fraser had not fully absorbed the implications of the tactic, and on this day on the battlefield at Saratoga, Fraser was a sitting duck, out in the open, and he had fallen into the gun-sight picture of Timothy Murphy&rsquo;s eye. </p><p>The British general could actually see Murphy in his distant sniper post in the tree, but at 300 yards away he probably felt in little danger. His own troops, for example, were armed mainly with British Army regulation .75-cal. &ldquo;Brown Bess&rdquo; muskets, which&mdash;because of their quicker-loading smooth bores&mdash;usually couldn&rsquo;t hit much past 80 yards on purpose.</p><p>Murphy&rsquo;s bullet missed. Instead of hitting Gen. Fraser, it lightly nicked his horse. Murphy, who reportedly was armed with a rare handmade double-barreled rifle, would have pulled a catch to flip up the pre-loaded bottom barrel. He would have performed a quick series of complex mental calculations, trying to adjust his aim for wind, elevation, and for the inevitable vertical and lateral drift of the bullet, which at that far distance could be severe.</p><p>The American sniper fired again. The second bullet missed, again clipping the general&rsquo;s horse. At that point, Murphy either would have paused to begin the time-consuming process of reloading his flintlock longrifle, which even for a crack shot like Murphy could have taken as long as 30 seconds, or more likely, someone would have passed him up another, pre-loaded longrifle.</p></p><p><p>In any event, Sgt. Timothy Murphy lined up his target for his third attempt. The fate of the United States of America hung in the balance. He squeezed the trigger. The bullet flew.</p><p>The guns used by Sgt. Murphy were uniquely American. In fact, I would argue the American longrifle is the arm that made the United States of America. It opened up the frontier, penetrated the wilderness, served as an engine of American commerce and family life, conquered human and natural enemies, and helped enable European settlers to overthrow the shackles of tyranny and establish the beginnings of a great nation in a vast, rugged and often hostile land.</p><p>Like the country itself, American longrifles were the heirs of a long tradition of European knowhow. And yet they were also uniquely transformed for use in the rugged New World frontier.</p><p>The new nation of America was forged by rugged settlers, trappers, and soldiers often armed with American longrifles, which were first produced by European-born gunsmiths in the 1620s and adapted from the shorter-barreled, larger-caliber Swiss-German Jaeger hunting rifle used in the forests of central Europe.</p><p>The lighter Americanized guns featured barrels of up to four feet in length, often adorned with nicknames and personalized designs and inscriptions. The new guns were noted to be &ldquo;long, graceful and accurate in both hunting and warfare.&rdquo; </p><p>This gun and its close relatives saw action in the French and Indian Wars, the American Indian Wars, the American Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Texas War of Independence, and in countless long-forgotten battles with lethal animal predators. It fed America, freed it from tyranny, and set it on a course toward astonishing growth and prosperity. </p><p>The American longrifle was also known as &ldquo;the Kentucky rifle&rdquo;&mdash;as Kentucky was once the catch-all word used to describe much of the little-known Western wilderness of the Appalachians and beyond&mdash;and &ldquo;the Pennsylvania rifle,&rdquo; as Lancaster and other Pennsylvania towns were a &ldquo;Silicon Valley&rdquo; of innovation and creativity for gun designers in the 1700s. </p><p>In his 1924 book <em>The Kentucky Rifle</em>, John Dillin traced its evolution as a kind of rhapsody: &ldquo;From a flat bar of soft iron, hand forged into a gun barrel; laboriously bored and rifled with crude tools; fitted with a stock hewn from a maple tree in the neighboring forest; and supplied with a lock hammered to shape on the anvil; an unknown smith, in a shop long since silent, fashioned a rifle which changed the whole course of world history; made possible the settlement of a continent; and ultimately freed our country of foreign domination. Light in weight; graceful in line; economical in consumption of powder and lead; fatally precise; distinctly American; it sprang into immediate popularity; and for a hundred years was a model often slightly varied but never radically changed.&rdquo;</p><p>The next time you feel especially proud to be an American, you might like to take a minute to think of a rifle commander named Daniel Morgan, who was Sgt. Tim Murphy&rsquo;s commanding officer that day on at Saratoga, and his squads of riflemen from the villages and backwoods of Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky and elsewhere on the frontier. And you might like to say a private word of thanks to them, because they were vitally important in the creation of the United States. </p><p>I feel connected to Dan Morgan and his riflemen for another reason, too. My seventh great-grandfather on my father&rsquo;s side, a fellow from Virginia named Samuel Houston, was reported by his own son to have been one of Morgan&rsquo;s riflemen, and at least one account places him with Morgan and Murphy at Saratoga, as an officer and paymaster. As paymaster, I&rsquo;d wager he was popular among the troops! I served in the Iraq War as a U.S. Navy SEAL sniper, and if these accounts of Sam Houston&rsquo;s service are true, it turns out I&rsquo;ve got sniper&rsquo;s blood in me going way back to the Revolutionary War. (Believe it or not, I didn&rsquo;t find out about this until I was researching this book.) </p><p>Dan Morgan was a big, ornery, professional wagon-driver with a strong taste for liquor, gambling, getting into fights and pre-marital sex. He set up house with a gal named Abigail Curry &ldquo;without benefit of clergy,&rdquo; as they said back in those days, who bore him two daughters before finally marrying her in 1774. He was also one of the greatest marksmen in Colonial America. Remember, this was a country of sharpshooters on the frontier, a country where every week, from Maine to Georgia, shooting contests were held where civilian riflemen attempted to snuff out the light of a distant candle without damaging the wick or candle.</p><p>The American longrifle brandished by Morgan and his riflemen was not the main infantry arm of the rebellious Colonists, not by a long shot. Less than 10 percent of the American troops carried them. The most common infantry gun for both sides in the Revolutionary War was the European-style smoothbore flintlock musket, which had a shorter range than the longrifle but had the advantages of being faster to reload&mdash;15 seconds was a typical reload time, twice as fast as the longrifle&mdash;and unlike the longrifle, it could be fitted with a bayonet, which was very handy for close-quarter combat. And in the worst case, you could swing a musket like a club and do some damage. Not so with the longrifle. If you tried to clobber someone with a longrifle, chances are it would snap into pieces.</p></p><p><p><br /></p><p>I&rsquo;ve been in some hairy combat scrapes myself, but it&rsquo;s difficult to picture how tough it would have been to work an American longrifle on the battlefield. After you fired one round, you had to stand up and fiddle with pouring an exact measurement of dry powder into the muzzle, plus lead ball, and push it in with a long wooden rod, all the while praying to God to save you from the wind blowing your powder all over your boots, or the rain gumming up the mechanism, or an all-too-common misfire, or getting shot while standing up fully exposed out in the open for 30 seconds. No wonder so many riflemen hid behind trees whenever they could. </p><p>The longrifle&rsquo;s lack of a bayonet occasionally proved tragic for the Americans. At Guan Heights during the Battle of Long Island on Aug. 20 and 21, 1776, Hessian mercenary troops armed with faster-loading, bayonet-tipped muskets overwhelmed troops of Gen. John Sullivan&rsquo;s rifle battalion while the Americans were trying to reload. Many Americans were quickly slaughtered in macabre fashion. &ldquo;The greater part of the riflemen,&rdquo; recalled one Hessian officer, &ldquo;were pierced with the bayonet to the trees.&rdquo; </p><p>In fact, many of the great battles of the war did not feature American guerilla attacks from the woods. Instead, they were head-on, open-air shoot-outs, bayonet charges and slugfests featuring British troops often armed with Brown Bess muskets, facing Colonial troops armed with an assortment of European-sourced muskets and locally produced copies, with both sides supported by cavalry, artillery and other accoutrements of war, including sabers, some flintlock pistols and even tomahawks and hatchets.  </p><p>Following the logic of musket technology, and the traditions of European military tactics, musket firing on both sides was typically group-volley fire at enemy linear formations en masse at short ranges, rather than individually aimed fire at specific long-distance targets. Even the Revolutionaries&rsquo; legendary hit-and-run pursuit of British troops from Lexington and Concord through woods and country roads at the start of the war on April 19, 1775, was conducted by Colonial militia mostly armed with muskets and bird guns known as &ldquo;fowling pieces,&rdquo; not longrifles. The epic American defense of Bunker Hill and Breeds Hill two months later was fought mainly with muskets, too. </p><p>But American riflemen and their longrifles, which were originally designed not to kill British soldiers but to nail small-to-medium-sized game on the frontier&mdash;as well as hostile Indians&mdash;provided a powerful extra edge to the Revolutionaries in several critical moments of the war. The rifling of the longrifle&rsquo;s barrel imparted spin on the ball as it flew out of the muzzle, greatly increasing its stability in flight and thereby its accuracy over the smoothbore musket.</p><p>Through the Revolutionary War, Gen. Washington periodically deployed companies of riflemen, such as Morgan and Murphy, as long-range scouts, rangers, skirmishers and snipers, and as a shock force that could, when they were available, provide a powerful overlay to Continental Army regulars and Colonial militia. And in several pivotal moments, the frontier-bred riflemen from places such Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia delivered spectacularly, and may even have affected the course of the war and sped the American victory. </p><p>Which brings us back to the battlefield at Saratoga, at around 11 a.m. on Oct. 7, 1777.</p><p>Sgt. Timothy Murphy&rsquo;s third shot found its target. It squarely hit British Gen. Simon Fraser in his belly, who probably never dreamed he was in danger of being shot from so far away, at least not 300 yards. Murphy&rsquo;s bullet created one of the most painful of battle injuries, a stomach wound. As he lay dying, Fraser spoke of seeing the American rifleman who shot him, far off in the distance.</p><p>When they saw their leader fall and get dragged off the battlefield, British troops panicked, broke ranks and soon fell back in retreat. The tide of battle was reversed. The loss of Gen. Fraser, explained his boss, Gen. Burgoyne, &ldquo;helped to turn the fate of the day.&rdquo; Ten days later, he and 6,000 British troops surrendered to the Americans, handing them a spectacular victory.</p><p>I like to think of my ancestor, Sam Houston, standing beside Morgan, Murphy and the other American riflemen, proudly clutching their longrifles as they watched the redcoats surrender. It&rsquo;s recorded that the Americans graciously treated the defeated British officers to a delicious feast to show their honor. If my seventh great-grand-daddy was part of the festivities and if his appetite was anything like mine, I&rsquo;ll bet he had a prime spot in the chow line.</p><p>The American triumph at Saratoga, the first time the rebels beat the British in a set-piece battle, stopped the British plan to sever the rebellious Colonies in two. And in Paris, the French ministers of government were so impressed that they soon decided to formally enter the war on the American side, a development most historians now believe meant that from that moment on, in the long run, the war was essentially won, or at least the chances of defeat were radically reduced.</p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>I remember 1973 well. I had this former-professional-football-player-turned biology teacher who put a snake in a cheerleader&rsquo;s purse one day. She shrieked, jumped from her seat, raised imaginary pompoms and cried, &ldquo;Yeah team, fight, fight, fight.&rdquo; The snake was unimpressed, but the display burned into my brain the power of autonomic reflexes, <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blogs/fundamentals-win-fights/" target="_blank">muscle memory</a>, and I never missed another of my high school&rsquo;s football games. </p><p><a href="http://www.streamlight.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Streamlight</a> was founded that same year, and unlike the involuntary subject in an experiment that would result in mandatory counseling for witnesses, the company&rsquo;s products savored danger from the beginning. Over the course of 40 years, Streamlight has gained a reputation for building quality gear for law enforcement, first responders and outdoorsmen. </p><p>Weaponlights and lasers are part of Streamlight&rsquo;s lineup now, and I&rsquo;ve been very pleased with the performance of my TLR-1. When the TLR-2G arrived for testing, its profile, eye-catching green laser and slender, single-battery operation tickled a few memories.</p><p>It&rsquo;s billed as weighing 4.58 ounces by the company, with the provided battery, although mine tipped the scales at 4.5 ounces. The main body measures 3.090 inches long, but the activation paddles (it&rsquo;s ambidextrous, by the way) add another .3 inches. That&rsquo;s a good thing, though, because finding those on-off switches is nearly intuitive, even with gloves on in the dark. </p><p>The TLR-2G has a 1.47-inch waistline, and is 1.83 inches tall when measured from the top of the rail to the bottom of the unit. White-light output is 200 lumens, which is more than adequate to momentarily daze a perp or illuminate a standard-sized room. </p><p>The main body is constructed of 6000-series, machined aircraft-grade aluminum and it has the rugged feel of a weaponlight. A polymer housing rounds out the unit. Everything is flat black, as it should be, with the exception of a thin silver ring encircling the LED housing, Streamlight model number, website and that annoying bright-yellow, legally mandated warning label that details how pointing the laser at a perpetrator may permanently damage his eyesight worse than the case of lead poisoning he&rsquo;s about to get if he doesn&rsquo;t cease and desist. </p><p>It mounted instantly on my <a title="Read the full review of the Springfield XD. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/springfield-xdm-reviews/" target="_blank">Springfield XD</a>, and according to Streamlight will do so with anything having Picatinny rails. A five-key kit included with the TLR-2G allows you to adapt it to a variety of other rail systems. </p><p>Once mounted, the activation paddles are close to the front of the trigger guard. In my case, the right-side paddle was just below where my index finger rests along the frame during a proper drawstroke. Finding it was fast and easy. From the right side (directions are reversed on the left side), pushing down turns on the constant-lighting mode and up provides temporary activation. Tap twice, fast on the upstroke and the strobe function comes on. To keep the strobe going, tap twice, then move real fast to the constant position. </p><p>That&rsquo;s the source of my only complaint. There&rsquo;s a bad guy in the house, he may be armed and it&rsquo;s dark, yet I&rsquo;m supposed to remember that? It&rsquo;s eerily reminiscent of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7Jvsbcxunc" target="_blank">Tony Orlando and Dawn song</a>: &ldquo;Tap Three Times&rdquo; if you want to strobe me. Thankfully there&rsquo;s a way to disable the mode by (and I&rsquo;m not making this up), &ldquo;&hellip;tapping the momentary switch ten times very rapidly and holding down the tenth time&hellip;&rdquo; There&rsquo;s more to the instructions, so I&rsquo;ll stick with the regular light function for now. If the unthinkable happens and I inadvertently activate the function, I&rsquo;ll confront the criminal in disco style. </p><p>A small and protected switch found at the back of the weaponlight allows you to choose modes. Leave it in the center and you get white light. Turn it to the left and you get only the laser. Toss it to the right for both laser and light. Dial it to your preferred setting and forget it.</p><p>Green lasers are slightly more visible to humans, thanks to evolution, but they go through battery power fast. With the TLR-2G, expect that single battery to last about 1.25 hours when using the light and laser simultaneously. The unit also comes with a small Allen wrench for adjusting the laser&rsquo;s windage and elevation. MSRP is $550, but Streamlight&rsquo;s limited-lifetime warranty means it could be the last weaponlight you&rsquo;ll ever need to purchase. </p><p>The user manual also states the laser&rsquo;s operation temperatures are between 32 degrees and 104 degrees Fahrenheit, which I thought odd. So after the weaponlight passed a brief range test with flying colors, I ran my usual freezer test. The unit is water resistant, so I only covered the LED and reflector housing in water and tossed it next to the okra. The laser on the TLR-2G actually projects through a hole in the LED&rsquo;s reflector, so I surmised the relatively protected unit could function reliably somewhere below the freezing point. </p><p>The laser powered up, worked perfectly and continued to do so during its glamour photos. I&rsquo;m sure 32 degrees is some sort of critical mark in the circuitry, and while this is far from a torture test, the unit survived, held zero and has the kind of operating controls ideal for self-defense. If I ignore the toe-tapping cadence required to engage strobe mode, I like this Streamlight a lot. </p><p>In all honesty, I pretty much knew how the freezer experiment was going to end. I&rsquo;ve only been able to kill one weaponlight with similar efforts (so don&rsquo;t place a lot of weight on the test), and back in high school even that cheerleader&rsquo;s laser green eyes still pierced the layers of ice she put between us after the reptile incident. Where was her warning label?</p><p>Check out the <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/GalleryItem.aspx?cid=22&amp;gid=254&amp;id=2339" target="_blank">Photo Gallery</a><br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><em>6/18/2013</em></p><p><em>“Fight For The Colors” by Don Troiani; courtesy of Historical Art Prints; (203) 262-6680; <a href="http://historicalartprints.com/" target="_blank">historicalartprints.com</a></em></p><p>The lieutenant grabbed his sergeant’s Sharps carbine, dropped the lever, slipped a linen cartridge into the open chamber, closed the action, cocked the hammer and capped the nipple. Using a fence rail for a rest, he jacked up the sights to what he thought an appropriate height for the range and squeezed off a shot at the advancing Confederate infantry, some 600 yards away. The bullet hit the ground in a puff of dust halfway to the Rebs. He had miscalculated, but had accomplished what he set out to do. Forever after, 2nd Lt. Marcellus E. Jones of Milton, Ill., and the 8th Illinois Cavalry could claim the honor of firing the first shot of perhaps the greatest of American battles: Gettysburg.</p><p>Unlike most of the encounters of the first two years of the Civil War, including Manassas and Antietam, Gettysburg involved significant cavalry action at both its outset and its end. As dawn broke on July 1, 1863, Brig. Gen. John Buford’s cavalry division, including Lt. Jones’ regiment, was deployed on the ridgelines north and west of the little Pennsylvania town. Buford’s job was to seek out the Army of Northern Virginia while shielding his own Army of the Potomac from prying enemy eyes. That morning both armies, primed for a climactic, perhaps war-ending, fight, were converging via roads that radiated outward from a Gettysburg hub.</p><p>The campaign began in the wake of Gen. Robert E. Lee’s “perfect battle” triumph over Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker at Chancellorsville in May. As with Second Manassas the previous year, Chancellorsville provided Lee with a springboard for an invasion of the North. The Confederate commander intended to take the war out of ravaged Virginia, supply his army off the enemy’s land, encourage anti-war elements in the Union states and perhaps capitalize on unforeseen events. Hooker followed, too tentatively for President Abraham Lincoln, who, given an opportunity, replaced him with Maj. Gen. George G. Meade. </p><p>As battle drew nigh, both forces began to concentrate near Gettysburg, where, following Jones’ shot, Buford’s horse soldiers traded fire with Confederate infantry skirmishers. The Union cavalry managed a gradual fighting withdrawal, delaying the enemy while federal foot soldiers marched to the rescue. Union infantry, the First and then the Eleventh Army Corps, arrived in the nick of time, halting the Rebel advance. As the day wore on, however, more Confederates poured into the fight and the advantage swayed back and forth until the Union line broke and defeated Yankees streamed back through Gettysburg to the high ground on Cemetery Ridge, where they rallied and set up a defensive position. </p><p>During the night, reinforcements arrived for both sides and July 2 found the Army of the Potomac deployed in a “fishhook” line, anchored on its barb end at Culp’s Hill. That afternoon Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles advanced his Third Army Corps from its position on the shank along Cemetery Ridge forward to the Emmitsburg Road, his left flank hanging in the breeze at an ancient glacial rock formation. Sickles, who thought he was improving his tactical situation by advancing, was unaware that Lee had planned an attack on the Union left. The assault, delayed by organizational difficulties, was launched late that day, and in heavy fighting at sites that would forever after be part of the American military iconography-Devil’s Den, Little Round Top and the Wheatfield-the stubborn federals were driven back to Cemetery Ridge, from where an exhausted Confederate force could push them no farther. An evening strike at Culp’s Hill failed as well.</p><p>July 3 opened without major combat, but an afternoon artillery duel preceded the disastrous Confederate infantry assault known forever afterward as “Pickett’s Charge” after Maj. Gen. George Pickett, who commanded one of the three divisions. A lesser known fight, of interest to students of firearm technology, occurred some three miles behind the Union lines as Maj. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart, moving his cavalry division to exploit any advantages gained by the infantry attack on the Union center, engaged a federal cavalry division under Brig. Gen. David M. Gregg in a series of dismounted firefights and conventional saber charges. </p><p>Gettysburg was a small arms watershed, with every type of firearm technology available during the war, from obsolete muzzleloading smoothbore muskets to more modern rifle-muskets, breechloading, single-shot rifles and carbines, revolvers, sabers, long-range target rifles, and state-of-the-art repeating rifles in action somewhere on the battlefield during the three days of fighting. </p><p>By mid-1863, the Union cavalry was a heavily armed force, with each trooper carrying a breechloading carbine, saber and cap-and-ball revolver. At first glance, dismounted horse soldiers, with their faster-firing shoulder arms backed up by six-shot handguns, might seem to have an advantage over infantrymen armed with single-shot muzzleloading rifle-muskets. In reality, however, Civil War cavalry did not engage in stand-up fights with infantry, as the mounted arm’s tactical role was quite different than that of foot soldiers. In addition to not being schooled in infantry tactics, a dismounted cavalry force immediately lost a quarter of its potential firepower, as every fourth man was required to hold horses behind the skirmish line. </p><p>Breechloading carbines had long been preferred for cavalry, as they could be fired and reloaded on horseback. Such use in the Civil War was rare, however, and carbines were primarily used for dismounted skirmishing. In addition to the Sharps, the men in Buford’s cavalry screen were equipped with a variety of carbines, including the Burnside, Sharps &amp; Hankins, Gallager, and Smith and Merrill. The guns fired .50 to .54-cal. cartridges with 40- to 45-grain powder charges. All, save the Smith and Merrill, were operated by lowering a trigger guard lever to expose the chamber for loading. All but the Sharps &amp; Hankins used semi-fixed ammunition-a cartridge containing powder and bullet with priming supplied by a percussion cap placed on an external nipple. Civil War carbines used a variety of non-interchangeable specialty cartridges of different shapes and materials, some of which acted as breech seals, although the Sharps and Merrill depended on mechanical breech sealing. Such ammunition diversity proved an ordnance officer’s nightmare, especially when, as was often the case, a unit was armed with several varieties of carbines.</p><p>The sturdy and accurate Sharps used a combustible .54-cal. linen cartridge (which replaced the old paper cartridge that allowed loose powder to migrate into places where it could explode), and was the most common and popular carbine. The Gallager chambered a .52-cal. brass cartridge that had to be manually extracted after firing, often with great difficulty, and was variously described as “inefficient” and “not equal to a bar of iron” in field evaluation reports by the men to whom it was issued.</p><p>The .54-cal. Burnside, as durable and accurate as the Sharps, fired a tapered brass cartridge loaded in a breechblock chamber that tilted upward and featured a primitive bump extractor that jarred the fired case loose on opening the action. The .50-cal. Smith employed a rubber cartridge that expanded to seal the chamber on firing, and then shrank for easy manual removal. A well regarded gun during the war, it has remained so in original and reproduction form among carbine shooters in the North-South Skirmish Ass’n. The .54-cal. Merrill used a paper cartridge which, like the Sharps paper rounds, was fragile and often broke up in cartridge boxes due to the “jouncing” effect conveyed by trotting horses. The majority of respondents to a late war survey of carbine effectiveness considered the Merrill “worthless.” </p><p>The most modern gun on the field that day was the Sharps &amp; Hankins designed by Christian Sharps after he left the company that produced carbines bearing his name. It fired a .52-cal. rimfire cartridge with powder, bullet and priming compound all in one convenient water- and jounce-proof copper package. Most Sharps &amp; Hankins carbines were purchased by the navy, but New York bought some as well, apparently including those carried by three companies of the 9th New York Cavalry at Gettysburg.</p><p>Historical myth has long held that Buford’s troopers were armed with seven-shot repeating Spencer carbines on July 1, and credits the firepower of the Spencers with delaying the Confederate advance. In reality, the fighting that morning was between loosely deployed skirmish lines on both sides. The cavalry presence forced the Confederates, who did not know where the Union infantry was, to deploy into line of battle, which took up the time needed for Union infantry to arrive. Casualties were light on both sides. One cavalryman reportedly fired only a dozen rounds from his carbine all morning. </p><p>Spencer repeating rifles (not carbines, which would not be produced until October 1863) firing rimfire cartridges were indeed used in combat at Gettysburg, but not until the July 3 cavalry fight. General Gregg’s division included Brig. Gen. George A. Custer’s Michigan Brigade. The 5th and part of the 6th Michigan Cavalry had recently been issued Spencers, and the 6th had used them for the first time in the eastern theater of war in a skirmish at Hanover, Pa., on June 30. </p><p>When he encountered Gregg, Gen. Stuart ordered the 34th Virginia Cavalry Battalion to dismount and hold the Rummel farm. After two regiments with Sharps and Burnside carbines failed to dislodge the 34th, the Spencer-armed 5th Michigan was ordered to drive the Virginians out. The 34th was actually a mounted infantry outfit armed with a mixture of muzzleloading Enfield and Richmond rifle-muskets and shorter-barreled Richmond rifle-muskets purpose-built for such service, as well as revolvers. The outcome of the ensuing firefight between two approximately equal forces armed with old and new technology was ambiguous. The Wolverines had to withdraw when they ran low on ammunition, but the Virginians, though holding the field, suffered an astounding 75 percent casualty rate compared to the 8.7 percent rate suffered by the Michigan men-statistics that did not bode well for a Confederate future. </p><p>In the wake of the dismounted firefight, Stuart ordered a mounted charge and the subsequent series of wild melees saw sabers and cap-and-ball revolvers, mostly .44-cal. Colt Model 1860 Armies, used at point-blank range. One soldier remembered that handguns were “discharged … into the very face of the foe” as the horsemen slammed into each other. Most of the 7th Michigan Cavalry’s casualties that day were caused by sabers and revolver bullets. Confederate Brig. Gen. Wade Hampton was severely slashed in the head twice by troopers from the 1st New Jersey Cavalry before the Rebels retreated, ending the fighting for the day. </p><p>Artillerymen were issued a limited number of revolvers, mainly to dispatch mortally wounded horses, although they were used on occasion to defend a battery. Infantry officers usually carried personally owned handguns, more as badges of rank than offensive arms. At Gettysburg some of those handguns were indeed fired at the enemy, however. In the Wheatfield fight Capt. Garrett Nowlen of the 116th Pennsylvania used his revolver in close action, and Confederate Col. Franklin Gaillard of the 2nd South Carolina remembered that the fighting “was so desperate I took two shots with my pistol at men scarcely thirty steps from me.”</p><p>Although cavalry action at Gettysburg was extensive in comparison to previous major battles, the infantry bore the brunt of the fighting over the three days of combat. Blockade runner deliveries of British Pattern 1853 Enfield pattern arms coupled with captures at Chancellorsville and a small but steady domestic production, primarily at Richmond Armory, resulted in an Army of Northern Virginia that was, according to Confederate Col. Edward P. Alexander, 90 percent armed with rifled .54- and .58-cal. arms as it entered Pennsylvania. An even higher percentage of the Army of the Potomac’s soldiers were armed with imported Enfields and Austrian Lorenzes and Model 1861 Springfield rifle-muskets from vastly expanded armory production and deliveries from contractors. </p><p>With the exception of specialized units in the Army of Northern Virginia, marksmanship training had improved little in either army since the war began. Ironically, the 21st New York infantry, which took shooting practice seriously at ranges up to 500 yards, was mustered out of the service prior to the Gettysburg campaign. The 121st New York, 15th New Jersey and other regiments conducted some familiarization firing at various known distances in the spring of 1863, but ignored range estimation and marksmanship basics.</p><p>Occasional attempts at long-range fire by line outfits at Gettysburg, including a volley aimed by the 56th Pennsylvania at the 55th North Carolina at an undetermined distance on July 1, proved ineffective. Brigadier General Hobart Ward, commanding a brigade on Houck’s Ridge between the Wheatfield and Devil’s Den on July 2, ordered his men to hold fire until the Rebels were 200 yards away, which, following modern verification by range-finder at various spots on the field, turns out to be the average infantry engagement range at Gettysburg.</p><p>Although the rifle-musket was predominant on the Gettysburg battlefield, there were older .69-cal. smoothbore muskets in service in some regiments on both sides. When the 6th Minnesota infantry charged the railroad cut west of town on July 1, a number of the Badgers suffered buckshot wounds from smoothbore “buck-and-ball” rounds. One Yankee struggling with the 2nd Mississippi’s color bearer for that regiment’s flag had “a ball and three buckshot … through the skirts of my frock coat … .” Around 10 percent of the arms captured by the Union First Army Corps that day were smoothbores, reflecting the accuracy of Col. Alexander’s arms estimate. </p><p>The New York and Pennsylvania regiments of the Irish Brigade used their smoothbores to good effect when they closed with the enemy on the slope of a stony hill adjacent to the Wheatfield, but perhaps the most significant smoothbore story at Gettysburg was that of the 12th New Jersey Infantry. In their position on Cemetery Ridge, the Jerseymen disassembled their buck and ball cartridges on July 3 while awaiting Pickett’s charge, creating massive ad hoc charges of fifteen or more buckshot for their Model 1842 muskets. The men of the 12th laid low until Confederate infantry came within 50 yards of their position, then delivered a massive volley into the 26th North Carolina, a regiment already battered on July 1, virtually destroying what remained of the unit. Years after the war, when the veterans of the 12th erected their Gettysburg monument, it was surmounted by one large sphere and three small ones-and inscribed with the words “buck and ball.”</p><p>The combat role of Civil War sharpshooters is often confused with that of modern snipers. Although some were detailed to what could be called long-range sniping duty, most sharpshooters were intended to be expert skirmishers, deployed in front of a main line of battle in loose formation in advance or retreat. The Army of Northern Virginia formed a number of brigade sharpshooter battalions, selected from a brigade’s best shots, in early 1863. Those men were armed with rifle-muskets, but well trained to use them effectively, and did so in the Gettysburg campaign, delivering heavy harassing fire on Cemetery Ridge from the area of the Bliss barn and the town’s rooftops. A South Carolina battalion commander estimated that his men fired more than 200 rounds each on the morning of July 3. </p><p>Perhaps the most famous Gettysburg incident attributed to Confederate sharpshooters was the death of Maj. Gen. John Reynolds on July 1, but a close examination of that incident by Gettysburg scholar Dr. David Martin disproves several such claims and concludes that Reynolds, who was indeed too far forward for a general, was hit by fire from the opposing line of battle. The scope-sighted British Whitworth rifle is often associated with Southern sharpshooters, but despite the unsubstantiated postwar claim of one veteran, it is unlikely any were in use at Gettysburg. Likewise, the long-told story of a heavy New England-made target rifle allegedly discovered in a Confederate position at Devil’s Den after the battle, despite the fact that the gun was on display at the battlefield museum for many years, is also, to be kind, extremely suspect.</p><p>Although there had been proposals in the spring of 1863 to create sharpshooter battalions in the Union Army, the plan never materialized. There were, however, several regiments and companies of sharpshooters distributed unevenly through the Army of the Potomac. The two regiments of Berdan’s sharpshooters, both assigned to the Third Army Corps, were armed with Sharps rifles, with one heavy barrel, long-range rifle per company carried in the regimental supply wagons for retrieval in static combat situations. Parties of Berdan’s men did good work on the southern edge of the Gettysburg battlefield, particularly in the fight for Little Round Top. Interestingly, when four companies of Berdan’s First Regiment, supported by the 3rd Maine, encountered Brig. Gen. Cadmus Wilcox’s Alabama brigade on a reconnaissance in force into Pitzer’s Woods on the morning of July 2, the resulting 15-minute firefight, in which the sharpshooters expended 95 rounds per man, cost the Alabamans only 56 casualties. </p><p>The army’s two companies of Massachusetts sharpshooters had disposed of most, but not all, of their heavy state-supplied W. D. Langdon target rifles in exchange for Sharps rifles after Antietam, but also counted a few Merrill rifles in their ranks at Gettysburg. When Rebel sharpshooters firing from Gettysburg rooftops decimated a party of New York skirmishers, the First Company was deployed in response, and killed and wounded a significant number of their Confederate counterparts. Capt. Richard S. Thompson of the 12th New Jersey recalled watching some Massachusetts sharpshooters armed with scope-sighted target rifles firing from Cemetery Ridge at Confederate sharpshooters in the Bliss barn. Thompson’s description of their tactics, with a three-man team including a shooter and spotter, bears a striking similarity to modern sniper techniques.</p><p>Although many Confederates thought they had gained, at worst, a draw in the immediate aftermath of the battle, Gettysburg would prove, in retrospect, to indeed be the “high water mark” of the Confederacy. Lee withdrew his battered army south, with Meade tentatively following. Almost two years of bloody combat remained, but from then to the end of the war, the Army of Northern Virginia would remain on the defensive, hoping for a game-changing event that would never come.</p><p>In the years after the battle there were other contenders for first-round honors, but none seriously challenged Lt. Jones, who left the Union Army as a captain in 1865. For decades thereafter, until his death in 1900, Jones no doubt regaled the members of Grand Army of the Republic E.S. Kelly Post No. 513 in Prospect Park, Ill., with tales of his historic Sharps shot. At one point he and some comrades came back to Gettysburg and erected a small monument on the spot, then private property, now within the National Military Park boundary. It still stands.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>One afternoon, a 37-year-old mother of two heard a knock at the front door of her home. At first, the woman assumed the visitor was a solicitor and told her 9-year-old twins not to answer. When the knocking continued and the door bell began ringing repeatedly, the woman called her husband at work. Her husband advised her and the children to hide while he called 911. The family hid in a crawlspace in the attic. Meanwhile, the intruder had forced his way into the home using a crowbar. After rummaging through the home, the intruder worked his way to the attic where he was met with a .38-cal. revolver. The woman fired six times. The intruder was later transported to a local medical center and was expected to survive his multiple gunshot wounds. (<a href="http://www.ajc.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em></a>, Loganville, GA, 1/5/13)</p><p>A local 31-year-old man may have thought breaking into a senior citizen's home early Saturday would be easy pickings. But that was before he met the 88-year-old woman who owns the residence. Sgt. Brice Woolly, Ardmore Police Department Patrol Division, said dispatchers received a call about 4:35 a.m. "The call was from an alarm company. They said there was an intruder in the house and the owner had the subject and was holding him at gunpoint," Woolly said. Officers arrived at the residence and took the intruder into custody without incident. He was booked into the Carter County Detention Center pending formal charges.

Meanwhile an accomplice climbed in a front window. Mrs. Farkas fired a shot that sent both men fleeing, one leaving behind a machete. Police apprehended three men later and charged two with malicious entry.

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>6/17/13</em></p><p>Victory Defense Consulting partners up with some of the industry's most influential companies to host the Colorado Freedom Shoot on June 29-30, 2013. The competition will be held at Colorado's largest public range, the Pawnee Sportsmen's Center in Briggsdale, CO. This family-friendly event will have handgun, carbine and long-range challenges for cash prizes, gear and giveaways. Participants may shoot solo or compete as teams. </p><p>&ldquo;Due to the recent legislation that was passed by the Colorado state legislature, this could very well be the last competition of its kind held in Colorado,&rdquo; stated President of Victory Defense Consulting, J.J. Sutton. &ldquo;This shoot is important because it's the last shoot where one can acquire magazines that can carry, or be adapted to carry more than 15 rounds in the state of Colorado.Not only that, but the new legislation now sends jobs, manufacturers and tens of millions in revenue to other states &ndash; leaving many without jobs.&rdquo;<br /><br />Along with the competitions will be skeet, trap and sporting clays events. Featured shooters will be on hand to provide demonstrations, instruction and pose for photographs.Several of Colorado&rsquo;s Senior Law Enforcement Officials who have joined together in a Law Suit against the new legislation will also be in attendance to discuss their efforts in protecting the freedoms Colorado citizens are seeing altered.</p><p><strong>Saturday June 29th</strong> <br /><em>Handgun Competitions:</em>From the Concealed Carry, speed and accuracy drills ($50) <br /><em>Speed Steel Challenge:</em>5 rounds/reload/5rounds $5/Challenge<br /><em>Carbine Competition:</em>Defensive engagement using steel and paper ($50)<br /><em>Long Range Competition:</em>Mission Key Card with Sequenced Engagement of known distance steel targets ($50)<br /><em> &ldquo;The Biden Challenge&rdquo;</em>: $25, firearm and ammunition included<br /><em>&ldquo;MOD Armory Night Vision Shoot&rdquo;</em>: $25 firearm and ammunition included. Contestants will compete for a $1,000 gift certificate and other prizes provided byMOD Armory.</p><p><br /><strong>Sunday June 30th</strong><br /><em>4-Person Team Event:</em>$160/team. Each team will provide one shooter per competitive evolution; each evolution will be a blind challenge revealed to competitors only after the shooter has been selected. Events may include some or all of a selection of handguns, carbines and long range shooting platforms.<br /></p><p>All weapon class shooting is limited and will be at a first-come, first-serve basis. There will be a $20 discount for those engaging in all three events. All competitions will be using a &ldquo;defensive shooting&rdquo; theme, to include low round counts, mandatory movements and forced reloads. </p><p>For further information on weapons, weapon configurations, accessories and how to sign up, check out<a href="http://www.victorydefense.com/training.cfm" target="_blank">www.victorydefense.com/training.cfm</a>or visit theevent <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/102974203245194/" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>.</p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Merkel RX Helix]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>6/14/2013</em><br /></p><p>Though the classic American big-game rifle is clearly adapted from European designs, rifles from the continent have never really gained much of a foothold in the modern U.S. hunting market. Part of that disconnect is pure misunderstanding, as many European rifles have features adapted to their style of hunting that appear non-traditional to many of us stateside. The <a href="http://www.merkel-usa.com/" target="_blank">Merkel</a> RX Helix is just such a rifle, built from the ground up for the quick action and fast shooting of driven hunts. Lightweight and ergonomic, the RX Helix is right at home in the woods. </p><p>The RX Helix is a straight-pull bolt-action rifle designed for rapid follow-up shots. The fixed bolt handle is perched just above the shooter&rsquo;s grip to allow for quick access and slides straight to the rear and then returns to the in-battery position with no lifting necessary. When the bolt is cycled, the bolt head unlocks and rotates mechanically inside the aluminum receiver to extract and eject the spent case before feeding a fresh round from the single-column, detachable-box magazine. The process is smooth and far faster than that of a traditional turn-bolt action and with less motion to take the shooter&rsquo;s eyes from the target. In addition, since the bolt does not protrude through the rear of the action, there is a theoretical margin of safety provided by the solid rear of the receiver facing the shooter. As for safeties, the RX Helix&rsquo;s intuitive two-position manual safety catch is located on the tang. It is actuated by a sliding the generous button rearward and is released by forward movement, the rifle&rsquo;s bolt cannot be cycled with the safety engaged. </p><p>Like the action, the two-piece stock is designed for rapid offhand shooting with a generous vertical pistol grip. Made of European walnut with a glossy finish, the stock features a modern yet functional checkering pattern and a soft and effective recoil pad. The shape of the stock lends itself to quickly mounting the rifle and makes it comfortable to shoot from the standing position. The overall appearance is futuristic yet very Teutonic with its flaring palmswell grip cap and angular cheekpiece. Synthetic stocks and upgraded wood are also available. </p><p>Although not evident at first glance, the RX Helix is a take-down design that allows the user to quickly disassemble the rifle for travel or storage as well as to change calibers. Breaking it down into its three primary components requires no tools. The fore-end is released by depressing the release latch button at the six o&rsquo;clock position and sliding the stock forward and off the receiver. With the fore-end removed, a single lever protruding below the barrel is turned 90 degrees downward and the barrel slides forward with a slight twist. Reversing the procedure assembles the rifle in a few seconds; it&rsquo;s easier to assemble and disassemble than it is to explain the process. There are three caliber groups: Mini (.222 Rem., .223 Rem.), Standard (6.5x55 mm Swede, .308 Win., 30-&rsquo;06 Sprg., etc.) and Magnum (7 mm Rem. Mag., .300 Win. Mag.). Calibers are interchangeable within each group but not across the full spectrum of cartridges. Additional barrel configurations featuring different contours, sight options and lengths are available and the fore-end&rsquo;s barrel channel is relieved slightly to accommodate them.</p><p>The rifle was tested for accuracy using a 6X hunting optic, not a target scope. Though the accuracy was acceptable, this is a hunting rifle, not a benchrest gun. The RX Helix really shines when you step away from the bench and shoot offhand. With an exceptional trigger and a functional stock design, it proved to be extremely &ldquo;shootable.&rdquo; Though otherwise a consistent and reliable rifle, we did encounter some issues with the <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester</a> Supreme XP3 ammunition. Accuracy ranged from fair to poor with that load and, in one circumstance, the bolt froze and had to be beaten open. Inspection of the ammunition and spent cases did not offer a diagnosis, but the problem did not occur with the other three types of ammunition used. This single ammunition-related failure-to-extract was the only malfunction encountered out of more than 200 rounds expended. </p><p>Our test rifle featured &ldquo;driven hunt&rdquo; red- and green-dot fiber-optic iron sights, which are drift-adjustable for windage and adjust for elevation using a hex screw on the interchangeable front sight. The receiver has two integral sections of Picatinny rail and optional quick-detachable rings are available. The only mechanical issue we encountered, which was attributable to the rifle, was a rear sight that &ldquo;walked&rdquo; out of the dovetail after more than 100 rounds; some thread-locker on the setscrew would likely solve the problem.</p><p>Assuredly, the European styling may be a bit different than what we are accustomed to, but the RX Helix is very good at what it&rsquo;s designed to do. It would be ideal in hunting locales where lever- and slide-action rifles are commonly used. This rifle would not be the best choice for Western hunts where cross-canyon shots might be possible, but at normal hunting distances, in timber, or in any tight cover, the RX Helix is in its element. </p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Merkel, <a href="http://www.merkel-usa.com/" target="_blank">merkel-usa.com</a><br /><strong>Importer:</strong> Steyr Arms, Inc.; (205) 655-8299; <a href="http://www.steyrarms.com/" target="_blank">steyrarms.com</a><br /><strong>Caliber:</strong> .308 Win.

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>6/26/2013</em></p><p>As firearm design standardized around prevailing types of locks, a unique nomenclature evolved for describing specific parts common to most or all guns. That terminology grew along with the emergence of different kinds of guns and operating systems, and today, those who manufacture, sell, repair and shoot firearms rely on a highly developed vocabulary. Even though certain models contain parts unique only to that particular gun, and while some makers may call a similar part by different names, everyday firearm nomenclature is in fact very functional.</p><p>Language differences aside, gun folks the world over know that a &ldquo;slide&rdquo; is the moving top piece of a semi-automatic pistol, that &ldquo;locking lugs&rdquo; can be found on the &ldquo;bolts&rdquo; of various rifles and shotguns, and that the majority of &ldquo;repeaters&rdquo; have an &ldquo;ejection port.&rdquo;</p><p>Specialized gun-speak certainly can appear arcane and mysterious to the novice shooter, but for many firearm enthusiasts, learning to talk the talk is part of the fascination and fun.</p><p><strong>Parts Common to Most Guns</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_common_large.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_common_small.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="293" /></a></p><p><strong>Bolt-Action Rifles</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_bolt_action_large.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_bolt_action_small.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="118" /></a></p><p><img src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_bolt_assembly.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="266" /></p><p><strong>Over/Under Shotguns</strong></p><p>Even though parts may have the same name from platform to platform, they may not have the same function. A bolt in a semi-automatic shotgun has a different function from the bolt&mdash;really the locking bolt&mdash;in a revolver. </p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_overunder_large.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_overunder_small.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="191" /></a></p><p><img src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_overunder_action.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="263" /></p><p><strong>Semi-Automatic Shotguns</strong></p><p>Regardless of whether it is a rifle, shotgun or pistol, most cartridge firearms have some parts nomenclature in common, such as the receiver, trigger, extractor, firing pin and sear. Repeating firearms generally have a bolt and an ejection or loading port, sometimes referred to as an action port.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_semisg_large.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_semisg_small.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="209" /></a></p><p><img src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_semisg_action.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="296" /></p><p><strong>Semi-Automatic Pistols</strong></p><p>When it comes to semi-automatic pistols, some terms, such as &ldquo;dust cover,&rdquo; have a completely different meaning than when they are used in reference to a rifle. The &ldquo;dust cover&rdquo; on an M1911 just refers to the front part of the frame that keeps dust away from the recoil spring and guide rod under the barrel. </p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_semipistol_large.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_semipistol_small.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="395" /></a></p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_pistolinside_large.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_pistolinside_small.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="314" /></a></p><p><strong>Double-Action Revolvers</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_revolver_large.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_revolver_small.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="309" /></a></p><p><img src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_revolver_interior.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="303" /></p><p><strong>Single-Action Revolvers</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_sarevolver_large.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/home-carousel/images/gp_sarevolver_small.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="281" /></a><br /></p><p><br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>6/26/2013</em><br /></p><p>Rod Herrett is a mechanical savant. He has a deep and innate understanding of mechanical processes and can implement them into the production of handgun stocks. Stocks? Don&rsquo;t most people refer to them as grips? We had to get this out of the way.</p><p>&ldquo;Back in the early &rsquo;60s,&rdquo; Rod told me as we walked through his Twin Falls, Idaho, plant recently, &ldquo;my dad had a contract with the government for walnut panels on .45 Autos (1911). The government specs called them stocks, and he said that if the government calls them stocks, that&rsquo;s what they are.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;Handles are for shovels, grips are carry-on luggage and stocks belong on guns.&rdquo;</p><p>Rod&rsquo;s dad, Steve, was a shipfitter in Panama during the 1940s. For those whose knowledge of the trades may be scant, a shipfitter is someone who can fabricate or repair just about anything found on a modern boat&mdash;everything from parts of the hull to critical engine parts to a marine-quality dining table. Steve&rsquo;s interest in handguns and hunting prompted him to start making custom stocks for his revolvers. In 1955, he moved to Twin Falls and founded <a href="http://www.herrett-stocks.com/" target="_blank">Herrett&rsquo;s Stocks</a>. Rod grew up in the sawdust-drenched environment of the stock-making business.</p><p>Herrett&rsquo;s became famous for a variety of aftermarket handgun stocks. Competitive shooters flocked to Herrett&rsquo;s for the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;Made to Measure&rdquo; stocks that provided a custom full-contact interface between shooter and pistol. That kind of custom fit affords more precise control of the handgun in terms of consistency and recoil recovery. I, for example, have a thick, meaty paw with short, fat fingers. The beautiful factory target stocks from <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CustomContentDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=750001&amp;catalogId=750051&amp;content=11001" target="_blank">Smith &amp; Wesson</a> on my treasured N-frame revolvers are so thick that I must twist the revolver in my hand and suck up the recoil with my thumb in order to have the correct amount of purchase on the trigger with my index finger. The result is my thumb joint gets hammered every time I fire the gun. When the cartridge is .44 or .45 caliber, it can be distracting at best, and even debilitating to get off subsequent shots; hence the need for an aftermarket solution.</p><p>However, as interesting and pleasing as custom stocking is, it will not entirely support the business of running a shop with several employees. Herrett&rsquo;s contracts with a number of aftermarket handgun &ldquo;grip&rdquo; companies&mdash;many of which you may know&mdash;to produce their products. Also, many smaller gunmakers contract with Herrett&rsquo;s to produce their company&rsquo;s stocks, which includes laser engraving of the company logo. It is in this environment that Rod shines.</p><p>When I arrived for my tour of the facility, Rod had me join him at a CNC machine where he had just modified the program to add a step in the manufacture of 1911 stocks made from acrylic for one of those contract companies. CNC machines are typically used to machine metal&mdash;usually under a shower of water-soluble oil coolant&mdash;but Rod adapted it to wood and synthetics by installing high-speed router motors and not using coolant.</p><p>Later we looked over several machines he and his dad designed and built from scratch. Some were nearly 50 years old and still in service. As one who has some mechanical ability but lacks anything beyond the most simple design capabilities, I was greatly impressed at the innovation and execution of these machines.</p><p>Then we visited the finishing and custom stock room where Dee Eiselein holds court. For the last 36 years every set of custom handgun stocks has been shaped in her hands. She is a master stockmaker&mdash;part custom prosthetic designer, combined with the highest level of woodworking skills&mdash;and is teaching her craft to her daughter. She showed me a set of stocks she made for a customer who is missing the index finger of the shooting hand. The stocks are shortened and modified to allow the middle finger to serve as a trigger finger. I tried it and found it remarkably adaptive, without a strange feeling. Then I offered up my hand for fitting.</p><p>A hallmark of Herrett&rsquo;s custom stocks is a hand tracing to determine critical dimensions. Normally you would follow the directions for a tracing found on the website, but I had the advantage of having the master fit me. She traced the outline of my hand on a piece of paper with the last three fingers separated from my index finger and the thumb comfortable to the side. I then went to the stock room and chose two blanks of exhibition-grade walnut with a beautiful flame grain. One would become a Detective Gun Stock for my Smith &amp; Wesson Model 24 .44 Spl. with a 3-inch barrel, a gun that is with me nearly every day. The Detective pattern provides a substantial grip with a minimalist profile to better facilitate concealed carry. </p><p>For the other, we tried to find a way for me to fit into the Jordan Trooper pattern because it transfers recoil to the center of the palm better than most other styles, but, alas, my fingers are just too short. That pattern, by the way, was designed by <a title="See Bill Jordan on American Rifleman TV. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/videos/artv10-bill-jordan-speaks/" target="_blank">Bill Jordan</a>&mdash;the Border Patrolman and exhibition shooter, rather than the camo pattern designer. I met Jordan years ago, and when we shook hands his totally engulfed mine much as a child&rsquo;s hand gets lost in an adult&rsquo;s hand, so it&rsquo;s no mystery as to why he designed these stocks. We settled for the Roper style that carries on much of the style of the S&amp;W target stock but in a thinner and less bulky execution. This set of stocks will cloak one of my other Model 24 Smiths, a 4-inch version. An aside for S&amp;W aficionados: Herrett&rsquo;s testing gun for N-frame Smiths is a 6 1/2-inch barreled, five-screw Model 1950 Target in .44 Spl. Devoid of blue and incapable of being fired, it is the test gun for every set of custom N-frame stocks. </p><p>Several weeks later my stocks arrived, and, of course, I could not wait to get them on their new homes. Ms. Eiselein once again performed her magic. Both stocks fit perfectly, and the flame-grain pattern dresses up each revolver beautifully. Before I wrote this, I ran a few rounds through each revolver. The load I use is 8.0 grains of Alliant Unique behind a 245-grain Lyman 429421 semi-wadcutter. It&rsquo;s a warm load but safe in modern revolvers. I would not shoot it in a vintage Triple Lock. In the relatively light Model 24 one needs to pay attention in order to recover fast enough for a follow-up shot. The new stocks filled my hand very well, dispersing recoil throughout the palm, yet my trigger finger still had plenty of purchase allowing good trigger control.</p><p>Each set of stocks set me back a couple of bucks shy of a C-note, plus $50 for the exhibition grade walnut. Some will recoil at the cost, but for a custom, hand-made pair of stocks it&rsquo;s really a bargain. I&rsquo;ve tried other aftermarket stocks on my Smiths. Some were functional but plain; most of the others are too bulky. With these from Herrett&rsquo;s I have the best of both worlds&mdash;a good fit and beauty.</p><p><img title="Herrett's Stocks" src="../../Webcontent/gallery/255/2045_MG_2372_web.jpg" alt="Herrett's Stocks" width="644" height="429" /><br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>While I&rsquo;ll always believe that a handgun is the best concealed option for self-defense (notice I said concealed option), I&rsquo;ve been taking a look at knife laws because of a recent discussion with Doug Ritter, chairman of <a href="http://www.kniferights.org/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1" target="_blank">Knife Rights</a>. </p><p>In my research I&rsquo;ve found that knife laws can be even more confusing than gun laws in some areas. Some states have laws that limit the type of knife&mdash;fixed versus folding&mdash;and even the blade length that can be carried. To make matters worse, cities have jumped into the fray by making their own laws that often conflict with state laws. </p><p>My discussion with Ritter revealed that I&rsquo;ve probably broken a few knife laws over the years, but there is no way I&rsquo;m going to divulge where those transgressions occurred. Suffice it to say that my research showed that I might have skirted the law with a knife in a state where I was legal to have my .45 on my hip. Does that make any sense? </p><p>Thankfully, some states are <a title="Find out what law Alaska recently passed. " href="http://beforeitsnews.com/survival/2013/06/alaska-governor-parnell-signs-knife-rights-act-2478466.html" target="_blank">realizing the ignorance</a> of some of their knife laws, and are working to remedy the situation. If you&rsquo;ve ever looked into the knife laws of your state, post your knowledge to help others. Who knows I might get the opportunity to visit your state, and I&rsquo;ll want a knife to come along. <br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

At its lowest setting, this scope provides a 28-foot field of view at 100 yards, while the highest power setting pulls distant targets in for more precise shot placement. </p><p>&ldquo;With the 6:1 zoom ratio of the VX-6 erector assembly, we&rsquo;re able to deliver far more range and utility than ever before,&rdquo; said Pat Mundy, communications manager for Leupold &amp; Stevens, Inc. &ldquo;There is simply no distance from 100 to over 1,000 yards that the VX-6 4-24 can&rsquo;t handle.&rdquo;</p><p>Two illuminated reticle options are available: the Boone and Crockett Big Game reticle and the Varmint Hunter. Both feature Finger Adjustable, pop-up resettable 1/4 m.o.a. adjustments, push button illumination and side focus parallax, and are compatible with Leupold&rsquo;s Custom Dial System. </p><p>The non-illuminated model offers the TMOA reticle, which features tic marks in 1 m.o.a. increments on the vertical and horizontal crosshairs allowing for range estimation and accurate wind drift and bullet drop compensation. Also new are the VX-6 Target Adjustments with resettable zero and an elevation zero stop.</p><p>Other features include 34 mm matte-black maintube, generous eye relief, Leupold&rsquo;s Quantum Optical System combined with Xtended Twilight lens coating for light transmission and clarity, and DiamondCoat 2 exterior lens coating for resistance to scratching and abrasion. The optics are also waterproof, fog proof and shock resistant. <br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

The youths wore what appeared to be blood-spattered clothing. The neighbor retrieved a firearm and confronted the interlopers. They were held at gunpoint until police arrived. The teens had run away from a juvenile rehabilitation camp just two days before. They had broken into the cabin and brutally murdered the elderly couple staying there before the armed citizen was able to stop them.

They found Jasper Brisbon, 32, in the living room of one of the units, with a gunshot wound to his torso. He was taken to Abidngton Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Police said Brisbon had forced his way into an apartment and confronted a resident, who got an AR-15 and insisted Brisbon leave. When Brisbon approached him instead, the resident fired one shot, then called 911, authorities said. The resident has not been charged with a crime, said Montgomery County First Assistant District Attorney Kevin Steele.

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>In researching several topics, I keep coming up with quotes from several handgunners of note. Some of them are well known, others may be the sort that gets lost in the pages of history. There is a great deal of wisdom in this kind of stuff, and I thought that readers would be interested in seeing what the old-timers were thinking about and also how they expressed themselves. Some of the language seems stilted and awkward, but I think you&rsquo;ll agree that they can really make a point that is as true today as it was a century back. How about this one?</p><p>&ldquo;No possible rapidity of fire can atone for habitual carelessness of aim with the first shot.&rdquo; </p><p>If that doesn&rsquo;t make the point, I don&rsquo;t know what will. Apparently spray-&lsquo;n-pray was a problem in the 1880s when Theodore Roosevelt penned those words. Feel free to let me know what great gun quotes you like.<br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[We Don’t Need No Stinking Permits]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>When I first moved to North Carolina, pistol-purchase permits were as confusing as directions from the locals. The moonshiner&rsquo;s farmhouse burned to the ground in &rsquo;63, but instead of writing it off, it&rsquo;s still the county&rsquo;s main navigational aid and the source of many a folk song. I was equally lost trying to feel my way through a nearly 100-year-old law that requires a permit from the local sheriff to purchase a handgun (in addition to the NICs check), and were it not for the help of the personnel at the Hoke County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office I&rsquo;d still be singing the blues. </p><p>They walked me through the forms, explained the fees, the week I&rsquo;d be waiting to hear back and informed me I could only get five permits per year. Yeah, only five, and in my case that applies to every handgun I have on loan for testing. However, the staff at each sheriff&rsquo;s office is only enforcing the law, so there&rsquo;s no need to raise your voice or argue. In Hoke County&rsquo;s case, they were awesome and diligent. I may still have that deer-in-the-headlights look, but at least they steered me out of the road. </p><p>Five permits may sound bad, but other sheriffs in the state aren&rsquo;t nearly as generous, and that&rsquo;s part of the problem. The sheriff determines the rules, and each county has a different sheriff. Add elections and it&rsquo;s pretty easy to understand why the state House of Representatives is considering legislation that would change things, but the North Carolina Sheriffs&rsquo; Association has come out against the measure according to this <a href="http://www.nraila.org/legislation/state-legislation/2013/6/north-carolina-sheriffs-association-attempting-to-derail-repeal-of-permit-to-purchase.aspx" target="_blank">NRA-ILA alert</a>. </p><p>Even the number of handguns you can purchase in North Carolina gets confusing. In Cabarrus County, you can apply <a href="http://www.cabarruscounty.us/government/departments/sheriff/civil-records/Pages/Handgun-Purchase-Permit.aspx" target="_blank">once a month</a>, but you can get five permits per application. Forsyth County allows you <a href="http://www.co.forsyth.nc.us/sheriff/handgun_permits.aspx" target="_blank">12 permits per year</a>. Hoke County <a href="http://www.hokecounty.net/index.aspx?nid=436" target="_blank">allows five</a>, but it&rsquo;s only <a href="http://www.co.iredell.nc.us/departments/sheriff/permits.asp" target="_blank">four permits per day</a> in Iredell County. </p><p>As for reasons you can be denied, nearly all sheriff&rsquo;s offices list being of sound moral fiber as the first requirement to obtain a permit. That&rsquo;s a pretty subjective qualification, but I slid in under the radar despite my irregularity, so I assume they&rsquo;re relatively lenient in that regard. </p><p>In some of the other counties, the guidelines are a little more, well, weird. In Wake County you cannot have a suspended driver&rsquo;s license (<a href="http://www.wakegov.com/sheriff/divisions/pages/pistolpermits.aspx" target="_blank">check out No. 12</a>). That might make a little sense with DUIs, etc., but in Columbus County you&rsquo;d better not have an upcoming court date for any traffic violation, at all. </p><p>Then there are places that make it more like an employment application. Current and past employers are required in <a href="http://www.columbusco.org/dotnetnuke_2/sheriff/Permits/tabid/755/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Onslow County</a>, as well as signatures from three references. It&rsquo;s the same in <a href="http://www.carteretsheriff.com/images/stories/Press_Releases/Applications/Purchase_Permit_App.pdf" target="_blank">Carteret County</a>. </p><p>Of course there are always oddball things that catch your eye when you&rsquo;re researching a story. My personal favorite is the graphic Catawba County uses on its <a href="http://www.catawbacountync.gov/sheriff/concealed.asp" target="_blank">handgun-permit page</a>. It&rsquo;s a Desert Eagle pointed menacingly over the reader&rsquo;s shoulder. Some may claim it&rsquo;s aimed at shying homeowners away from even applying for a home-defense handgun. It&rsquo;s not. That&rsquo;s the same way people keep pointing me in the general direction of the long-dead moonshiner&rsquo;s shack&mdash;must be a southern thing.</p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[The Kel-Tec Sub 2000 9 mm Carbine]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>6/24/2013</em><br /></p><p><a href="http://www.keltecweapons.com/" target="_blank">Kel-Tec</a> is not a typical firearm manufacturer. Although it's a relatively small company in regard to its production volume, Kel-Tec has a catalog of products demonstrating innovative gun design and creative problem solving. For example, Kel-Tec recently garnered all kinds of attention with its unusual dual-magazine bullpup <a title="Read the full review on the KSG. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/kel-tec-ksg-review/" target="_blank">KSG shotgun</a>. In 2001, it released an update to its blow-back operated folding pistol-caliber carbine, the SUB 9, and called it the SUB 2000. Available in 9 mm or .40 S&amp;W, this rifle is unlike anything else on the market.</p><p>The most remarkable feature of the SUB 2000 is its ability to fold in half. This is done by pulling down on the trigger guard while swinging the barrel assembly up and over onto the receiver. When fully folded, the barrel is locked into place by a spring-loaded stud set into the shoulder stock's buttplate. This same barrel retention device can be locked to prevent the barrel from swinging back down into place using a proprietary brass security key. When unloaded and folded, the SUB 2000 weighs 4 pounds and will comfortably fit into a 16-inch long, 7-inch wide storage space. </p><p>Designing a carbine to fold required the designers to re-think just about every feature of the rifle. The blued barrel is 16-inches long and encased in a flat-sided polymer handguard. The front sight is a hooded fluorescent-orange fiber optic that is adjustable for windage and height. The rear sight is a pop-up aperture that folds out of the way when the gun is collapsed. </p><p>The receiver is constructed of black polymer with a textured pistol grip. The primary external safety, a large crossbolt safety button, is located just above the grip. When engaged, it blocks the hammer and disconnects the trigger. The magazine release is an oblong button located on the left side of the grip. The trigger is also polymer. </p><p>The components of the Sub-2000's action are housed in a blued steel pipe attached to the receiver, which also serves as the rifle's shoulder stock. The ambidextrous steel charging handle is located below the stock between the grip and the buttplate. The bolt can be locked in the open position by pulling the charging handle all the way to the rear and tipping it to the right, however the bolt does not lock open when the last shot is fired. </p><p>The SUB 2000 is designed to use common pistol magazines instead of a proprietary magazine. For this review, the 9 mm GLK17 model of the rifle was used, which accepts Glock 17 pistol magazines. Kel-Tec also makes versions of this gun that accept Beretta 92 and 96, Glock 19, SIG 226 and Smith &amp; Wesson Model 59 type magazines. The Glock version is popular because even if you don't own the pistol, the magazines are usually affordable, reliable and easy to find. </p><p>Taking the SUB 2000 to the shooting range was an enjoyable event. No other rifle on the range looks, or handles, like this one. Although it sacrifices some creature comforts for utility, the SUB 2000 is definitely fun to shoot. Let's get a few nits out of the way first. The magazine release felt stiff and a bit clunky. It functioned properly, but not prettily. You may find it takes some time to get used to the sight system. I had to move my cheek back and forth on the steel stock pipe until I found the right view. Speaking of that pipe, it's not the most comfortable cheek rest available. But none of these issues were game changers, especially when compared to the positives. </p><p>The level of felt recoil produced by the SUB 2000 qualifies it as a <a title="Learn more about low-recoil self-defense options. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/defensive-pistols-low-recoil/" target="_blank">low-recoil shooting option</a>. There were a few failures to eject during the first 50 rounds fired, which happened to be light practice rounds. The recoil spring and bolt for this gun are heavier than those found on a pistol, so don&rsquo;t be surprised if some varieties of weak-powered, low-quality rounds don&rsquo;t run well. After the first box of practice rounds, the gun worked reliably with all of the ammunition it was fed using 10, 17 and 33-round Glock factory magazines. The trigger on this particular rifle required 7 pounds of pull to cycle, but it was smooth with a crisp break like a quality double-action revolver. </p><p>In addition to the mild recoil, this rifle feels feathery light when pressed to the shoulder. With most of its 4 pounds of weight located at or behind the grip, this is an ideal gun choice for training new rifle shooters or for those who are not used to supporting a heavy rifle for extended practice or plinking sessions.</p><p>Formal accuracy testing consisted of firing five consecutive, five-shot groups from a bench rest into 25-yard targets. Group sizes hovered right around the 1.5-inch mark, with none of them exceeding 1.75 inches in size, with some as tight as 1.25 inches. For informal testing, a <a href="http://www.grizzlytargets.com/index.php?route=common/home" target="_blank">Grizzly Targets</a> IPSC Torso Target in a 2-in-1 combo stand was set at 50 yards. The tough AR500 steel plate rang with the regularity of a church bell. So the reliability and accuracy of the SUB 2000 are right where they need to be. </p><p>But one question in particular tends to show up when evaluating a pistol-caliber rifle like this one. Does a 9 mm carbine really offer a sufficient level of stopping power to be useful for home or personal defense? Logic dictates that if a 9 mm pistol loaded with quality hollow points can get the job done, then the increased accuracy and bullet velocity provided by a 16-inch rifle barrel would be even better. But hard data is always more useful than conjecture.</p><p>Using a <a href="http://www.cedhk.com/shop/" target="_blank">CED</a> M2 chronograph, 10-round strings of the two defense-grade loads tested for accuracy were clocked for velocity. The <a href="http://www.hornady.com/" target="_blank">Hornady</a> Custom 147-grain XTP, designed to operate at the sub-sonic velocity of 975 feet-per-second (fps) from a pistol, averaged 1,171 fps from the SUB 2000. <a href="http://www.doubletapammo.com/php/catalog/index.php" target="_blank">DoubleTap's</a> 124-grain +P brass-jacketed hollow points, which travel at 1,300 fps from a 4.5-inch barrel pistol, jumped to 1,655 fps from the SUB 2000. This increase in velocity boosts the level of energy for a 9 mm cartridge significantly. The Hornady load went from an estimated 310 ft.-lbs. of energy to 447 ft.-lbs., with the DoubleTap round increasing its energy from 465 ft.-lbs. to 754 ft.-lbs. As a point of reference, DoubleTap offers 125-grain .357 Mag. hollow points that strike with 710 ft.-lbs. of energy. That means this low-recoil rifle, when loaded properly with an extended magazine and fired at home defense distances, hits like a .357 Mag. over 30 times before it needs to be reloaded. Yep, that should do the trick. </p><p>The SUB 2000 is a handy little rifle that arrives from the factory ready to work. It has more than a decade on the market to attest to its reliability and usefulness. Like other pistol-caliber carbines, it fills an important shooting niche that floats between the high-power rifles and semi-auto handguns. It stretches the range and power of the 9 mm cartridge beyond what a pistol can provide. At the same time, owners will appreciate the cost-savings of ammunition and magazine compatibility with the pistols they already own. </p><p>But unlike other light carbines, the SUB-2000's compact folded size makes it exceptionally flexible in its possible applications. It can fit in a bug-out bag, laptop case or a small day pack for carry in the field. This rifle could be conveniently tucked into various nooks and crannies inside a car, truck or RV. It can be used for casual plinking, close-range small-game hunting or as a camp gun. It would be a top-notch second gun to match up with a personal-defense pistol, at home or while on the road. </p><p>Some folks need a piece of polished walnut attached to their rifle in order to think it&rsquo;s a good looking gun. But Kel-Tec knows that handsome is as handsome does. The polymer-framed SUB 2000 is fun, functional and available at a very reasonable price. What more do you want from a folding pistol-caliber carbine? </p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Kel-Tec CNC Industries, Inc.; <a href="http://www.keltecweapons.com/" target="_blank">www.keltecweapons.com</a><br /><strong>Model:</strong> SUB 2000 GLK17<br /><strong>Action:</strong> Blow-back operated semi-auto<br /><strong>Caliber:</strong> 9 mm<br /><strong>Finish:</strong> Matte black<br /><strong>Grip &amp; Forend:</strong> Black polymer<br /><strong>Rear Sight:</strong> Folding aperture, <br /><strong>Sights:</strong> Adjustable fluorescent blade with circular hood<br /><strong>Barrel Length:</strong> 16.1&rdquo;<br /><strong>Overall Length Open:</strong> 29.5&rdquo;<br /><strong>Overall Length Folded:</strong> 16&rdquo;<br /><strong>Weight Unloaded:</strong> 4 lbs. <br /><strong>Magazine Type:</strong> Glock G17<br /><strong>Twist:</strong> 1:16&rdquo; RH<br /><strong>Rifle Grooves:</strong> 6<br /><strong>Accessories:</strong> One 10-round magazine, brass security key, sight adjustment tool, manual, lock<br /><strong>Suggested Retail Price:</strong> $409</p><p><img title="Kel-Tec Sub 2000 Folded" src="../../Webcontent/gallery/255/2043KTSub2000_clsmgs01a_s_web.jpg" alt="Kel-Tec Sub 2000 Folded" width="644" height="299" /><br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>Now that the persistent chill has finally released it grip, more people are working to eliminate those extra pounds that developed over the winter through walking and running. While this is great for overall health, folks need to remember to keep themselves safe when out for cardio enjoyment. </p><p>When exercising outdoors, there are many external hazards in the world that can harm life or limb. These include vehicles, dogs and even two-legged predators. Many of these can be avoided by simply paying attention to surroundings, but I continue to see people listening to music via ear buds. While there is nothing wrong with music, and thank you for not forcing me to listen to whatever screeching you deem necessary to put one foot in front of the other, plugging both ears renders an important self-defense tool useless. </p><p>If you can&rsquo;t hear, how are you going to know whether a car has veered off of the road behind you, a dog is growling around the next corner or a bad person is trailing along until you reach a secluded location before attacking? I&rsquo;ve even seen bicycle riders using ear buds on busy northern Virginia streets. Not only is this against the law, it is amazingly stupid, and just continues the bogus mentality that people don&rsquo;t have to be responsible for their own safety (we are from the government, and we are here to help you). </p><p>While personally, I&rsquo;ve never needed music to work out, if you do try using only one ear bud. This allows one ear to be free to listen for potential problems. You could also work out in pairs, providing you with a partner if something happens and entertainment to help the workout feel less monotonous, eliminating ear buds. It also greatly decreases your chances of being attacked. </p><p>Lastly, always carry something with which you can fight back. While considered a fashion faux pas, there are numerous fanny packs designed to carry a handgun, along with your wallet, keys, etc. If you&rsquo;re uncomfortable carrying a gun, you could always carry a <a href="http://www.kimberamerica.com/pepperblaster" target="_blank">Kimber Pepperblaster</a>, <a href="http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/Search.aspx?site=All+Products&amp;num=15&amp;q=expandable+baton&amp;fgb=t" target="_blank">expandable baton</a> or even short walking stick. In the words of Captain Woodrow F. Call in one of my favorite books and movies: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it.&rdquo;<br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

For example, the Protector Polymer, like the Model 85, has a five-round cylinder and is rated to handle .38 Spl. +P ammunition. Other likenesses include a barrel that is a bit less than 2 inches long, an exposed hammer that operates in conjunction with a transfer bar and a frame-mounted firing pin, and a round-butt frame.</p><p>But rather than using steel or aluminum for the frame like the Model 85, the Protector Polymer relies on&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;polymer.

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>6/20/2013</em><br /></p><p>In the hall outside the press room at the <a title="Check out the Annual Meetings blog. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/BlogList.aspx?cid=25&amp;id=52" target="_blank">NRA Annual Meetings &amp; Exhibits</a> a few years ago there was a chance gathering of a half-dozen older gun writers; the hardcore, trigger-pulling kind, the guys who live for shooting. Well into the conversation somebody said &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; for about the hundredth time and we all broke out laughing. Of course that led to the old joke, &ldquo;What is an old shooter&rsquo;s favorite word?&rdquo; &ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo; </p><p>The dedicated shooters of my grandfather&rsquo;s generation suffered severe hearing loss rather early in life because they never used any hearing protection. My father&rsquo;s generation, those born during the Depression, picked up on the concept of ear protection, but too late to help. As well, it turns out that sticking cigarette filters in your ears is not the best protection. Folks my age, the 50-somethings, are probably the first generation to seriously use hearing protection when shooting. Even at that, I was an adult before I started using muffs regularly. My kids, and most of their generation, have used ear protection from day one.</p><p>The hard, cold truth is that if you live in America today you will suffer some noise-induced hearing loss in your lifetime. Loud music, city noise, concerts, movies, airplanes, lawn mowers, even your vacuum cleaner, they all add up. We can mitigate the degree of loss a great deal by wearing high-quality hearing protection when exposed to loud noises, but often the noise catches us unaware and is over before we act to plug our ears. Or, we simply don&rsquo;t think much about it, until the cumulative effect rears its ugly head years later in the form of a high-frequency hearing loss.</p><p>Remember that rock concert you attended or the NASCAR race? Or that time your knucklehead brother-in-law shot right beside your ear in the duck blind? Remember how your ears rang for days after? That ringing was an indication of permanent damage. You probably didn&rsquo;t notice anything at the time, but each one of those was a small deposit. It&rsquo;s like putting pennies in a jar. You don&rsquo;t notice much difference until, one day, you look and it&rsquo;s full. Or in this case, you can&rsquo;t understand what they are saying on the television. </p><p>If you are a shooter and spend a lot of time around guns, even if you are careful about hearing protection, you will probably experience a bit more hearing loss than the average citizen. Think about the times you removed your hearing protection in the range parking lot so you could have a conversation with your buddies.</p><p>Noise-induced hearing loss is caused in two ways. First is by a one-time exposure to an intense &ldquo;impulse&rdquo; sound, such as a gunshot. But it can also happen by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time. </p><p>Sound is measured in units called decibels. On the decibel scale, an increase of 10 means that a sound is 10 times more intense, or powerful. To the human ear it will sound about twice as loud. Normal conversation is approximately 60 decibels; heavy city traffic is about 85 decibels. A gun shot might be as loud as 170 decibels. Hearing loss occurs when your ears are exposed to continuous noise above 85 decibels or impulse noise above 140 decibels. The louder the sound, the more damage it creates. </p><p>Hearing works in humans because of a series of events that change sound waves in the air into electrical signals, which the auditory nerve then carries to the brain. Sound waves enter the outer ear and travel through a narrow passageway called the ear canal, which leads to the eardrum. The eardrum vibrates from the sound waves and sends those vibrations to three tiny bones in the middle ear called the malleus, incus and stapes. The bones amplify the sound vibrations and send them to the inner ear, called the cochlea. The cochlea is shaped like a snail and is filled with fluid. There is an elastic membrane that runs through the cochlea, called the basilar membrane. The sound vibrations cause the fluid inside the cochlea to ripple, and a traveling wave forms along the basilar membrane. There are hair cells, which are sensory cells, on top of the membrane. They move with the waves. As the hair cells move up and down, their bristly structures bump up against an overlying membrane and tilt to one side. This tilting action causes channels on the surface of the bristles to open, allowing specific chemicals to come in, creating an electrical signal. The auditory nerve carries the electrical signal to the brain, which translates it into a &ldquo;sound.&rdquo;</p><p>The hair cells near the base of the cochlea detect higher-pitched sounds, while those nearer the apex or center detect lower-pitched sounds. Exposure to loud sounds causes damage to those hair cells, as well as to the auditory nerve. The hair cells at the base are closer to the source of the noise and more susceptible to damage, and the result from noise-induced damage is a hearing loss in the higher frequencies. That kind of hearing loss may be accompanied by tinnitus; a ringing, buzzing, or roaring in the ears or head. </p><p>With a high-frequency hearing loss the sounds a person hears may become distorted or muffled, and it may become difficult for the person to understand speech. Any background noise makes it worse, and speech becomes very difficult to understand. People often think we are anti-social or grumpy, and I suppose some of us are, but mostly we just can&rsquo;t hear.</p></p><p><p><br /></p><p>I have been living with this for a very long time. Time and again over the years I was told by audiologists that they would be happy to sell me hearing aids, but that I would likely not use them. They were right, as I tried them anyway. The problem with the analog technology available at the time, and with the hearing amplifiers sold for hunting, is that they were not tuned to a specific individual&rsquo;s hearing loss and all noise was amplified across the entire frequency spectrum. But I didn&rsquo;t need that. I only needed the sounds at the higher frequencies to be amplified. My hearing is normal at the low- to mid-range frequencies. </p><p>The hearing amplifiers drove me crazy. They made everything too loud and were incredibly annoying and distracting. I could wear them for a few hours at best and that depended on what I was doing. It always ended with me clawing them out of my ears and basking in the relief that followed. That is why your grandfather and father always seemed to forget to use their hearing aids. Being socially deaf was preferable to the anguish of using those amplifiers for long periods of time. </p><p>With the emerging digital technology, the hearing aids on the market today are a modern wonder. If you have suffered a hearing loss and have not explored the new technology, you owe it to your loved ones to do so. Forget that it will change your life; you cannot imagine how family relations will be improved. I can again be part of a conversation without constantly asking people to repeat themselves, which for reasons I could never understand, seemed to annoy them.</p><p>I am hearing things I forgot existed, like the rustling of winter beech leaves in a gentle breeze or birds singing. I could hear that with some of the hearing aids I used in the past, but the difference now is that rather than being distracted and disoriented by a full spectrum of amplified sound, the specially-tuned enhancers improve only my deficient range and I forget I am even using them. I put them in during the morning and have gone to bed with them in, because they are so unobtrusive that I forget to remove them. </p><p>The newest digital hearing aids are tiny and hide behind the ear so they are virtually unnoticeable by others. Mine are &ldquo;open ear&rdquo; design so that air travels easily through my ear canal, which means there is no &ldquo;plugged up&rdquo; feeling that you have with a lot of hearing aids. </p><p>With digital technology and using the results of a hearing test, the hearing aids are programmed exactly to a specific hearing loss. Only the sounds you need amplified or modified are affected. They can be further controlled to adapt to different conditions. For example, most modern, high-end digital hearing aids have multiple automatic programs. One is normal for everyday use in conversation and gives you sharp clear sounds.</p><p>Another is for noisy backgrounds that will tune out the background noise while allowing the speech you want to hear to come through clearly. This actually lets you hold conversations at places like the NRA show, rather than just grin and nod your head like a fool. Another program is for talking on the telephone. You can adjust sound and clarity with some of the units by using a small hand-held remote control. These changes can be temporary for specific situations, or made permanent in the auto programs. When using the auto program in some units, the hearing aids can sense the environment you are in and change programs to adapt to the conditions, often without the person wearing them even being aware. Or they can be changed manually with a simple push of a button. They even have Bluetooth capability. While there are many options for digital hearing aids, Dr. Robert W. Hartenstein in Rutland, Vt., fitted me with a set of <a href="http://unitron.com/content/unitron/splash.html" target="_blank">Unitron</a> Moxi hearing aids. It&rsquo;s an overused clich&eacute;, but the truth is, they changed my life. Beware, though, this is not an inexpensive endeavor. My units were priced from $2,335 to $7,206 (each).</p><p>Digital technology has revolutionized life in America. Everything from our telephones to our toasters has changed. If you are suffering from hearing loss and have been waiting for the technology to advance, your wait is over. Call your audiologist today and come back to the world of the hearing. It&rsquo;s a remarkable place.</p><p><strong>NRA Hearing Benefits</strong><br />NRA Hearing Benefits gives NRA members access to free hearing screenings and discounts on hearing aids, and its hearing provider network has more than 1,500 offices nationwide.

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>6/20/2013</em><br /></p><p>There is no shortage of pre-owned but serviceable bolt-action rifles for sale at modest prices. Whether unwanted hand-me-downs, relics of bygone days, platforms that are &ldquo;past their prime&rdquo; or simply single-season splurges, used rifles&mdash;deemed to be in safe, firing condition by a gunsmith&mdash;can be easily upgraded and customized to enhance their downrange potential and aesthetics. Such improvements needn&rsquo;t break the bank, nor require the services of a veteran gunsmith, either, and the resulting firearm will not only be purpose-built for a specific task, it will also reflect the owner&rsquo;s personality.</p><p>In the subsequent pages you&rsquo;ll see a sampling of products used to breathe new life into a neglected, bead-blasted, bare-bones $200 <a href="http://www.remington.com/" target="_blank">Remington</a> Model 700 ADL. Know upfront that, like automobiles, rifle customization can run the gamut with regard to cost. Likewise, seldom will costs incurred during customization be recouped in a resale, so it is prudent to focus only on improvements that, in the end, serve a purpose; it&rsquo;s difficult to justify many high-end aftermarket add-ons. None of the items used for this project exceeded $300, and most were significantly less. Each was selected for its utility and value.</p><p>Although not a novice, I&rsquo;m not a full-fledged gunsmith, either. My experience level enabled me to approach the project with an eye toward the beginner, and the results can be easily replicated provided the manufacturer&rsquo;s directions are followed. In total, the build, which occurred in phases during a multiple-week period, took about four hours of labor to complete. Most of that time was spent in preparation. As for cost, sans the rings, bases, optic, bipod and sling, and excluding the original rifle cost, customization was about $650. That can seem expensive when compared to the prices of numerous high-quality low-cost rifles available new from manufacturers such as Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co., Remington Arms, Savage Arms, Stevens, Marlin Firearms and O.F. Mossberg &amp; Sons. But for a &ldquo;custom&rdquo; rifle outfitted with premium components, it can also legitimately be considered a bargain. </p><p>In addition to an authentic appearance, the Model 700 that emerged proved capable of delivering respectable accuracy; the same could not be said before the build, at which time 2-inch-plus group averages at 100 yards were commonplace. It&rsquo;s likely that, given some attention, you too can create an original piece that will excel on the range and in the field.</p><p><strong>Nikon Prostaff Riflescope</strong><br /><a href="http://www.nikonsportoptics.com/index.page" target="_blank">Nikon&rsquo;s</a> economical Prostaff riflescopes are possibly the best example of items selected because of their combination of utility and value. Despite constant re-zeroing when swapping between rifles, heavy recoil (from .300 Rem. Ultra Mag. to .375 H&amp;H Mag. and .416 Rem. Mag.) and frequent air travel, I&rsquo;ve yet to have a Prostaff fail, so it made sense that I&rsquo;d select one for this project. Nitrogen-purged, O-ring-sealed one-piece main tubes ensure that Prostaff scopes are waterproof, fogproof and shockproof. Additionally, the scopes have fully multi-coated lenses, Zero-Reset turrets with clicks valued a 1/4 m.o.a., 3.7 inches of eye relief, and 50- or 100-yard parallax settings. Offered in a range of magnification settings and objective lens sizes, I opted for a 4-12X 40 mm version with the standard Nikoplex reticle. Weight and length were 15.7 ounces and 14.1 inches, respectively. As to price, I found my scope in <a href="http://www.cabelas.com/" target="_blank">Cabela&rsquo;s</a> Bargain Cave for $160, with the company&rsquo;s regular price being $209. Expect the manufacturer&rsquo;s set retail price to be slightly more. </p><p><strong>Timney Trigger</strong><br />A smooth, consistent and, preferably, user-adjustable trigger is essential to extracting maximum performance from a rifle. Best described as &ldquo;horrendous,&rdquo; the factory trigger&rsquo;s replacement was mandatory, not optional, so I chose one from <a href="https://www.timneytriggers.com/" target="_blank">Timney Triggers</a>. Manufactured in the company&rsquo;s Phoenix, Ariz., facility, the triggers are hand-assembled from heat-treated components and said to have 0.0005-inch tolerances. The Model 700 version comes with an &ldquo;improved&rdquo; safety that blocks the trigger, not the sear, when engaged. Adjustable from 1 pound, 8 ounces to 4 pounds, I found the trigger&rsquo;s crisp, repeatable factory-set pull of 3 pounds to be ideal. Installation took less than five minutes. In addition to the Remington Model 700, the company offers replacement triggers for other manufacturers and models, too. Price: $135. </p><p><strong>Limbsaver Precision-Fit Recoil Pad</strong><br />Few people relish recoil; rather, most seek to reduce it. Among the best products for doing just that are those available from <a href="http://www.limbsaver.com/" target="_blank">Limbsaver</a>, a company best known for vibration-reducing products for compound bows. According to the company, recoil abatement is upward of 70 percent. Depending on a stock&rsquo;s design, the all-weather recoil pads can be replaced as easily as withdrawing two screws, removing the old pad, adding the new pad and retightening said screws. Such was the case on the Model 700&rsquo;s synthetic stock. Few things gunsmithing-related tasks are as simple. Price: $42. </p><p><strong>Lauer Custom Weaponry DuraCoat Shake &rsquo;N Spray Finishing Kit</strong><br />Nothing screams boring, bland or &ldquo;cookie cutter&rdquo; as loudly as a rifle with a black synthetic stock. To enhance durability and aesthetics, the choice was obvious: the <a href="http://www.lauerweaponry.com/" target="_blank">DuraCoat</a> Shake &rsquo;N Spray Finishing Kit. The $35 kits have everything necessary to finish a firearm, including cleaner/degreaser, scouring pad, 4 ounces of paint (choose from more than 200 colors), hardener, and a Preval Aerosol Sprayer. No preheating, baking or blasting is necessary, and the results are permanent. For this project I selected three colors: Norwegian Army Light Green, French Army Tan and Rhodesian Brown. As for stencils and templates, Lauer Custom Weaponry sells them, too. My stencils came from flora around the yard. <br /></p></p><p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Bergara Barrel</strong><br />The barrel is often referred to as the heart of a rifle, and for the build in question, a transplant was necessary&mdash;the prior owner&rsquo;s neglect resulted in a barrel that was ruined both inside and out. Perhaps the easiest, most economical choices for Savage and Remington rifles are replacements from Bergara. Featuring a Savage-style locking nut system and being pre-chambered, provided the owner has the proper tools (all of which are available from Brownells), swapping barrels takes only minutes. Unless one anticipates rebarreling rifles frequently, spending money for a vice, inserts, strap wrench, chamber gauges and rosin, among other things, is not advised. Fortunately, the barreled action can be shipped to <a href="http://bergarausa.com/" target="_blank">Bergara Barrels</a> North America in Duluth, Ga., where, for the cost of the barrel, shipping and $50, the company will remove the existing barrel, clean the action and bolt, and install and headspace the Bergara barrel. Barrels are available in both blued 4140 chromoly and 416 stainless versions, and in chamberings ranging from .223 Rem. to .300 Win. Mag. Price: $300 (blued chromoly) to $340 (stainless). </p><p><strong>Harris Bipod</strong><br />Outside of Camp Perry high power competitors, few shooters are able to place shots accurately at distance from the standing, offhand position. Although marksmanship improves when engaging targets while kneeling and sitting, precision bullet placement is best achieved from the prone position. For this very reason, a bipod accompanies me on the majority of my big-game hunts. Often imitated, U.S.-made <a href="http://www.harrisbipods.com/" target="_blank">Harris</a> bipods have proven the most user-friendly and durable of any that I&rsquo;ve used. Made of heat-treated steel and alloys, the bipods are easily affixed to the forward sling swivel stud on conventional rifle stocks; adapters enable attachment to various fore-end designs and rails. At rest, the bipod&rsquo;s spring-loaded legs run parallel the barrel of the rifle, yet when deployed, each leg is individually adjustable to level the rifle on uneven terrain. Harris offers a host of models from the Bench Rest (6 to 9-inch height) to the Model 25C (13&frac12; to 27 inches) in both solid and hinged configurations. Price: $92 to $156. </p><p><strong>Leupold Rings and Bases</strong><br />Because the rifle was devoid of iron sights, utilizing a riflescope was an absolute; however, a strong foundation is required to get the most from an optic. For the project rifle, I opted for the tried-and-true two-piece <a href="http://www.leupold.com/" target="_blank">Leupold</a> STD base with the windage-screw-secured rear ring, which offers ample hold for a .30-&rsquo;06 Sprg.-chambered rifle. For magnum chamberings, the dual-dovetail configuration is preferred. A benefit of the former is that, in case the receiver&rsquo;s drilled and tapped holes are misaligned, windage adjustments can be made on the base, not just the scope. As for rings, they were corresponding STD rings in medium size (0.770 inches in height). The bases and rings, which are available in matte black, gloss black and silver finishes, are machined from forged steel for maximum strength. Installation is both easy and quick. Price: $22 (bases), $28 (rings). </p><p><strong>Quake Industries Contour Rifle/Shotgun Sling</strong><br />Tired of your slung rifle or shotgun shifting or falling off your shoulder when trekking, especially during ascents? That&rsquo;s the very reason I prefer <a href="http://quakeinc.com/" target="_blank">Quake Industries&rsquo;</a> Claw Contour Rifle/Shotgun Sling. Manufactured from a durable, lightweight, weatherproof non-slip material permanently molded in place on the nylon webbing, Claw slings stay in place and are available in several color and camouflage schemes. Hush Stalker II swivels come standard. Price $25 to $41. </p><p><strong>Brownells Glasbed</strong><br />The reality is that even &ldquo;low-cost&rdquo; replacement stocks are not inexpensive, and frankly, there was nothing wrong with the standard synthetic stock, so I opted to &ldquo;improve&rdquo; rather than replace it. The obvious fix was glass-bedding, with <a href="http://www.brownells.com/" target="_blank">Brownells</a> Glasbed being the preferred product. Proper glass-bedding ensures a snug, consistent fit of the barreled action into the stock, and the epoxy was applied in the area ahead of the forward action screw (especially in the recoil lug recess) and at the tang. Glasbed, which is pre-colored either in black or brown, requires no cups or measurements for mixing, so there&rsquo;s no mess and uniformity is assured. Provided that directions are followed exactly, and that the non-flammable release agent is applied liberally, the results can be phenomenal. Consider it $32 well spent.</p><p><img title="Rifle Anew Shooting Results" src="../../Webcontent/gallery/254/2039RifleAnewShootingResults_web.jpg" alt="Rifle Anew Shooting Results" /><br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>By Paul Rackley </p><p>This season&rsquo;s Top Shot continues to be all about the shooting at the range, rather than the drama in the house, or in Colby&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;All star, all skill season.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s fine with me, and pretty much everyone I&rsquo;ve spoken to about Top Shot recently agrees. Who cares about how these people get along? Just show me some really cool firearms and make the competitors take some crazy shots. </p><p>This week&rsquo;s episode started with the longbow, a Black Widow longbow to be exact. Competitors had to hit a 30-foot target at 100 yards, with each circle in the bullseye representing different amounts of points. I was surprised at how poorly the group did as a whole. Only four shooters out of 13 broke 100 points, and only Gary surpassed 200 points. There were even two competitors&mdash;William and Kyle&mdash;who couldn&rsquo;t even hit the target. As expected, both were sent to the Proving Ground, along with Alex and Jamie, to test their bullseye skills with a Steyr SSG 08 at 200 yards. With the two furthest shots from the bullseye, Kyle and Jamie went to the Elimination Challenge to battle it out with a gun that almost every shooter would like to try at least once&mdash;the <a title="Learn more in this first episode on the Gatling Gun from American Rifleman TV. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/videos/artv-2011-gatling-gun-pt-1/" target="_blank">Gatling Gun</a>. </p><p><em>American Rifleman</em> contributor Garry James was the expert for this challenge, sharing his expertise with both shooters, who had to mow down three poles with this <a title="Watch the second episode on the Gatling Gun. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/videos/artv-2011-gatling-gun-pt-2/" target="_blank">iconic firearm</a> to stay in the quest to become History&rsquo;s Top Shot. While Kyle seems like he would be a nice guy to get to know, Jamie, an Elimination Challenge veteran, handily defeated him by being consistent in his motions and steady in his aim. </p><p>Top Shot is now down to 12 shooters vying for the $100,000 and <a href="http://www.basspro.com/" target="_blank">Bass Pro Shops</a> speedboat, and as long as the show continues the current format, I think we&rsquo;ve got a great season going. <br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Adjustable Sights ]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>The last revolver I carried as a peace officer was a <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CustomContentDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=750001&amp;catalogId=750051&amp;content=11001" target="_blank">Smith &amp; Wesson</a> Model 581. That is a fixed sight gun, so it requires a little skullduggery to zero for windage. In this case, it wasn&rsquo;t too difficult and I regularly qualified with the gun, even running the Colt Target PPC clean once or twice. </p><p>This happened a long time ago, but it got me to thinking about adjustable sights and whether or not they are worth the trouble. Millions of revolvers were made with adjustable sights during the time I was a cop, but at least as many without them were in use before I came along. Adjustable sights have lots of little parts that can break or come loose. If it is going to be used hard, you are probably better off to go with a revolver with plain fixed sights, as long as they are big enough to see. </p><p>Automatic pistols are a little different because their iron sights are typically mounted in dovetail slots, rather than cut from the metal of the frame. There&rsquo;s an important advantage to dovetail mounting a sight. It is instantly adjustable for windage, by simply tapping it to the right or left in its dovetail slot. Windage adjustments are seldom needed on a continuing basis, particularly after the first adjustment laterally centers the group. Elevation adjustments are a different problem. Changes in ammo, as well as other mechanical problems, sometimes force the shooter to come up or down a little. On a gun with dovetailed sights, the solution is a higher or lower front sight blade. I believe that changes in elevation are much more common on today&rsquo;s pistol ranges than changes in windage.</p><p>For reasons of handling, Designer/Pistolsmith Wayne <a href="http://www.novaksights.com/novak.html" target="_blank">Novak</a> came up with the original angled shape of the sight that bears his name. Of course, the main reason for developing the sight was to create a nearly indestructible system for aiming a pistol. Over 2 million have been made and they have been widely copied all over the world. Several years ago, Novak came up with something for those shooters who wanted to keep the classy contours of the original, but also have vertical adjustment capability. That sight in now available directly from Novak&rsquo;s.<br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>6/27/13</em></p><p>Boy Scout leaders in Nebraska were finding that the shortage of ammo was going to make the shooting and safe handling of firearms portion of Camp Cornhusker impossible, until they put out a call for donations. About 1,000 campers were going to have to shoot air guns instead of .22 caliber rifles, according to the <a href="http://siouxcityjournal.com/news/state-and-regional/nebraska/nebraska-boy-scouts-get-their-bullets/article_540d6ac8-4b30-540f-8c9f-49821b57e912.html" target="_blank"><em>Sioux City Journal</em></a>, so they asked for 24,000 rounds to be donated by the time camp commenced. Not only did they reach their goal, but far exceeded it, with a whopping donation of 65,000 rounds from donors as far as Florida. Now the Cornhusker Council is prepared to teach the safe handling of firearms not only this summer, but for the next three years.<br /></p><p>Jerad Reimers, Cornhusker Council district director, said, "Practicing with BB guns just isn&rsquo;t the same, even if they look like the real McCoy, Reimers said. A Scout won&rsquo;t treat the shooting experience the same way, because it&rsquo;s not." </p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>By Paul Rackley </p><p>With only 12 shooters left in the house, Top Shot producers brought back a popular challenge from Seasons One and Two. In what I&rsquo;m calling dropping dice, the competitors split into teams captained by two of my favorite shooters&mdash;Kelly and Jamie&mdash;to compete head-to-head with the Remington New Army 1875. </p><p>In the challenge, shooters shot out the dots on dice for one point for each hit. However, in a twist the shooter who knocked out the dots on the dice first closed the door on the competition. Gabby jumped Kelly&rsquo;s team to a quick lead that continued for the next two pairs to shoot. But as the dots increased Jamie&rsquo;s team ties the score before Chris humiliates Brian Zims and sends Kelly and group to the proving ground. There, the producers twisted things up by having Kelly, Brian, Gary, Alex, Gabby and Joe try to send three bullets through the center of three CDs for a point for each successful shot. </p><p>To be honest, it was pretty disappointing to see three of the six shooters go zero for three, but Kelly exhibited his rifle-shooting skills with three perfect shots. Of course with three shooters at zero, a tie-breaker was used to send Gabby and Alex to Elimination where they faced an old fashioned shooting gallery with the <a title="Check out one of the first articles on the Ruger 10/22. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/ruger-10-22-rifle-review/" target="_blank">Ruger 10/22</a>. </p><p>While Gabby is a great shooter, especially in her discipline, I quickly realized that she was probably headed home after this challenge. She had never fired this iconic rifle, much less set up her own little shooting gallery as a kid. She did very well, considering, hitting 45 of her 100 targets. Unfortunately for her, Alex hit 58. </p><p>I&rsquo;m going to miss Gabby. She wasn&rsquo;t a great female shooter. She was a great shooter who happened to be female. She is also the only woman to have ever made it to the individual stage of the competition, and the only woman to win an Elimination Challenge. <br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Terminology: Lanyard Ring (Or Loop)]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>This is an old term that describes the means by which a handgunner can tie his handgun to his person. Without exception, a lanyard ring is a steel ring or oval mounted on a swiveling mount on the butt of the handgun. The shooter uses a lanyard (heavy cord) that usually goes around his torso and snaps into the ring on the gun. If the handgunner goes into the water or takes a serious fall in rough country, he can be assured that the gun won&rsquo;t stray too far. </p><p>Popular mythology holds that this is a feature of the cavalry, but it was once a system used by anyone carrying a handgun. Both S&amp;W and Colt 1917 Model revolvers had lanyard rings, but the 1911 .45 pistols had a closely related device called a lanyard loop. This is a non-swiveling loop of steel mounted in the 1911 butt (bottom of the mainspring housing). </p><p>Curiously enough, the lanyard system is making something of a comeback. They show up on the incredibly complicated system of pouches, belts and armor worn by SWAT cops. And they also find their way to the butts of some of the best custom hunting and defense revolvers ever built. Top revolver smith Hamilton Bowen makes the rings to mount on his custom revolvers and even commissioned a run of period-correct lanyards to go with them. <br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Sgt. Leigh Ann Hester, Raven-42, & the Silver Star]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>7/3/13</em></p><p>They were shadowing a half-mile long convoy of 30 civilian  tractor-trailers that day, March 20, 2005, just south of Baghdad. They  were from the 617<sup>th</sup> Military Police Company, Kentucky National Guard, assigned to the 503<sup>rd</sup> Military Police Battalion/18<sup>th</sup> Military Police Brigade from Fort Bragg and they were there in three  Humvees serving as the security team for the other vehicles. Their call  sign was Raven-42. As the arid scrubland near the town of Salman Pak  slid past, the squad leader came on the radio to announce that the enemy  had just attacked one of the vehicles ahead. With that report the  Humvees sped up and rolled down the length of the convoy on the shoulder  of the road to meet the threat. In doing so, they put their vehicles  between the insurgents and the trucks making up the convoy, drawing the  enemy&rsquo;s fire off of the tractor-trailers. As Raven-42 swung into action,  the gunners on each Humvee started laying down suppressing fire with an  M2HB .50-caliber machine gun, a Mk. 19 40 mm grenade launcher, and an  M249 Squad Automatic Weapon. The insurgents had taken up positions in a  farmer's orchard next to the convoy&rsquo;s route and were using a pair of dry  irrigation ditches parallel to the road as an expedient trench line.  From behind effective cover, they began directing fire at the MPs using  Kalashnikov automatic rifles, belt-fed machine guns and rocket-propelled  grenade launchers. Near a house at the back of the field, seven  automobiles sat waiting with their engines running&mdash;obviously the enemy&rsquo;s  means of escaping the scene of the ambush.</p><p>The MPs quickly executed a right turn onto a perpendicular road that  put their Humvees in a position to flank the attackers. Just as Raven-42  did this, an RPG round struck one of the Humvees, wounding the three  soldiers inside. Simultaneously, ten insurgents moved forward across the  field to a position within about 60 feet of the spot where the  Americans had come to a halt. In the rear vehicle, Staff Sgt. Timothy  Nein threw the passenger door open, dismounted and dashed toward a  nearby berm as the enemy&rsquo;s bullets sliced the air around him. 23-year-old Sgt. Leigh Ann Hester of Nashville, Tenn. followed. From the cover of the berm, the two soldiers then opened fire  with their Colt M4s. In addition to the 5.56 mm bullets they directed  toward the ambushers with their carbines, five-foot-four Sergeant Hester  pumped out several 40 mm high explosive rounds from her M203 Grenade  Launcher.</p><p>At this point in the firefight, it was all up to Nein and Hester.  Three of their team members had been wounded early on and were therefore  incapable of contributing to the battle. &ldquo;We could not help them  because we were still being fired upon by the insurgents,&rdquo; Hester  recalled. The other team members were either treating the wounded, or  firing one of the mounted crew-served weapons. By virtue of these  circumstances, Staff Sgt. Nein and Sgt. Hester had become the tip of the  spear and they alone would have to take the fight to the enemy. Hester  later described the battle in these terms: &ldquo;The adrenaline was pumping,  the bullets were flying, and I didn&rsquo;t have any choice but to fight  back.&rdquo; Before deploying to Iraq, she managed a <em>Shoe Carnival </em>store in Nashville, but that Sunday afternoon outside of Salman Pak she was involved in the battle that would make her famous.</p><p>By that point in the firefight, the attackers had moved into the  ditches and hidden behind several trees along the backside of the lot.  The two MPs treating the wounded on the ground behind the rear Humvee  then came under sniper fire as the skirmish continued to escalate. Both  soldiers responded by firing AT-4 rockets toward the farmhouse where the  sniper was hiding. With the fire of the .50-cal. machine gun and the  SAW beginning to thump away at the enemy&rsquo;s flank, Staff Sgt. Nein and  Sgt. Hester laid down a continuous volume of fire at the 10 insurgents  in the closest ditch. Although the Americans were fighting back, the  situation had reached a stalemate. Despite the fact that they were up  against a numerically superior, heavily armed enemy force, the MPs could  not disengage. The lead Humvee was not going anywhere because of the  RPG hit, and a withdrawal was definitely out of the question because of  the wounded. Since their ammunition supply would run out long before a  relief force could get to them, Staff Sergeant Nein and Sergeant Hester  had only one real option: attack.</p><p>Hester then realized that her individual ammunition load-out was  getting dangerously low&mdash;too low to push forward and mop up the  ambushers. So she dashed back to one of the Humvees under fire and  retrieved more magazines for her M4, additional 40 mm rounds for her  M203, and a few M67 fragmentation hand grenades. Returning to the berm,  she handed a few magazines and grenades to Staff Sgt. Nein, and the two  rolled over the berm and spilled into the ditch to begin a final assault  to finish the opposition off once and for all. The vehicle-mounted  weapons forced the enemy to keep his head down while Nein and Hester  pushed forward tossing grenades and firing their M4s. When one needed to  do a magazine change, the other provided covering fire. Using this  method, Nein and Hester swiftly leap-frogged down the length of the  ditch and overwhelmed their opponents. Sgt. Hester killed three  insurgents with her M4 Carbine and a fourth with a 40 mm HE round from  her M203 grenade launcher. &ldquo;It was either them or me&mdash;and I wasn&rsquo;t going  to choose the latter,&rdquo; she later recalled.</p><p>At the end of the 30-minute long engagement, the battlefield was  found littered with 24 dead and six wounded insurgents. One unwounded  Iraqi was taken prisoner after apparently feigning injury in order to  avoid the battle. In addition to that, the MPs collected an impressive  haul of weapons and ammunition: 22 Kalashnikov rifles, six  rocket-propelled grenade launchers, 16 rockets, 13 RPK-type light  machine guns, three PKM belt-fed machine guns, 40 hand grenades, and a  mountain of small arms ammunition&mdash;123 loaded AK magazines and 25,000  rounds of belted 7.62x54r for the PKMs. Clearly, this had been no  lightweight insurgent ambush. Sgt. Hester and the other MPs also made a  chilling discovery in the aftermath of the firefight when several of the  insurgents were found to be in possession of handcuffs&mdash;a clear  indication of their intention to take prisoners that day. But that never  happened because the ambush of Raven-42 had not gone according to plan.  Rather than stopping the convoy with automatic weapons fire and  rocket-propelled grenades, most of the trucks rolled on toward their  destination unscathed. Rather than taking prisoners to be used for  internet propaganda, the insurgents captured no one. Rather than  controlling the firefight, the insurgents were dominated by a well-lead  and disciplined squad of U.S. Army soldiers that included two women.</p><p>Throughout the Global War on Terror, they have served the United  States military conspicuously and, in many cases, courageously. They  fly, they drive, they care for the wounded, they police, and they fight.  Their role in the military has changed a great deal during the last  century of U.S. military history. From the limiting, gender-specific  roles of the World Wars, through the evolving attitudes of the Vietnam  era, women have seen barriers lifted to such an extent that they now  serve in units that can expect to come under enemy fire. In the ranks of  the Army&rsquo;s Military Police Corps, Leigh Ann Hester&rsquo;s service provided a  rare opportunity for a woman to experience direct combat with the  enemy. In a 2005 interview, she described the uniqueness of those  circumstances herself:<em></em></p><p><em>There&rsquo;s no difference in gender here in the MP Corps&mdash;we&rsquo;re all  doing each other&rsquo;s jobs&mdash;the same jobs&mdash;there&rsquo;s no difference. We have  female squad leaders, female team leaders, female gunners, female  drivers&mdash;it&rsquo;s all the same job. We&rsquo;re all soldiers in the United States  Army.</em></p><p>Although she is certainly not alone in having experienced combat, Leigh Ann Hester <em>is</em> alone in one important distinction. In a ceremony at Camp Liberty near  Baghdad on June 16, 2005, she was awarded the Silver Star in recognition  for the way she fought that day near Salman Pak. This was the first  time since World War II that the Silver Star was awarded to a woman and  it is the only time an American woman has received that particular  decoration for direct combat action with the enemy. The significance of  this award was definitely not lost on her either, because after  receiving it Hester said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honor just to be considered for the  Silver Star because it&rsquo;s a very prestigious award and not too many  soldiers receive it.&rdquo; But when thrust in front of the cameras afterward,  Hester deflected questions that were directed at her as an individual.  Instead of talking about herself, despite having every good reason to do  so, the only satisfaction that she would express was that everyone in  her squad survived the battle: &ldquo;Mainly, I&rsquo;m just glad that we&rsquo;re all  here to talk about it.&rdquo; But the memories of March 20, 2005 are still  with her:<em></em></p><p><em>I think about it every day&mdash;the actions and the play-by-play of how  it happened. The pictures that are stuck in my mind about what I saw  that day. My fellow soldiers lying there bleeding, and me trying to  give them aid and get them to the hospital&mdash; medevac&rsquo;ed out on a  helicopter.</em></p><p>Although 2005 was firmly situated in an era that seemed at times  heavily characterized by shallow self-absorption and narcissism, Sgt.  Hester the shoe-store-manager-turned-decorated-war-hero still thought of  herself as being a member of a team. Her devotion to duty and devotion  to comrades might make you recall the closing line of the 1954 feature  film <em>The Bridges at Toko-Ri</em>. In that line, Rear-Admiral George  Tarrant (played by Fredric March) has just been informed of the loss of  Lt. Harry Brubaker (played by William Holden) and he asks, "Where do we  get such men?" The example of Leigh Ann Hester might inspire a  modernized version of that quote: &ldquo;where do we get such women?&rdquo;</p><p> </p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>7/3/2013</em><br /></p><p><a title="Find out how to get into NRA Action Pistol. " href="http://competitions.nra.org/news-and-events/action-pistol.aspx" target="_blank">NRA Action Pistol</a> is a challenging sport. Its national championship, the <a href="http://competitions.nra.org/championship-tournament/nra-action-shooting-championships.aspx" target="_blank">Midway USA &amp; NRA Bianchi Cup</a>, is considered by many professional shooters to be one of the toughest events on the calendar each year due to the extreme accuracy required to win. I&rsquo;ve been shooting the Cup for five years now, and over that time have collected some advice from the top shooters about the Bianchi Cup.</p><p><strong>Accuracy</strong><br />&ldquo;Shoot the match with the same quality of sight picture regardless of the distance to the target.&rdquo; &mdash;Dave Sevigny, 2009 Production Champion.</p><p>Dave means that unlike other matches where your sight picture will vary based on the distance to the target, at Bianchi Cup it&rsquo;s important to have a crisp front sight focus picture at all times when you&rsquo;re shooting an iron sight gun. Letting your focus go hazy will put rounds out of the 10 ring and into the eight ring, or worse yet the five ring of the target. Keep that front sight crystal clear and you&rsquo;re on the path to success.</p><p><strong>Time</strong><br />&ldquo;Six seconds is all the time in the world.&rdquo; &ndash; Bruce Piatt, multiple time Bianchi Cup champion.</p><p>At the new shooter&rsquo;s introduction in 2009, Bruce said that to a room of new shooters, myself included. I wrote it down and have remembered it since, because it&rsquo;s a constant reminder to slow down. At the Bianchi Cup, all the events are fired on a par time, meaning you have a fixed amount of time to fire the number of shots required by the string. Invariably, it&rsquo;s plenty of time. Too many new shooters rush and fire all their shots, instead of just relaxing, taking their time and only firing when the sights are where they should be.</p><p><strong>Nerves</strong><br />&ldquo;Just relax and shoot &lsquo;em in the middle.&rdquo; &ndash; Julie Golob, 2012 Midway USA &amp; NRA Bianchi Cup Women&rsquo;s Champion.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a big match! A national championship, with all the pageantry you&rsquo;d expect from a match this size. There are social events, a huge awards banquet with a dress code, and just about every major firearm media outlet shows up to cover the match. It is only natural that you would be a little nervous.</p><p>But don&rsquo;t sweat it. It&rsquo;s easy to get wrapped up in the competitive spirit, but that just leads to the jitters. Don&rsquo;t worry about the jitters, just relax. After all, this is supposed to be fun, right? </p><p>That&rsquo;s really the best part about Bianchi Cup&mdash;it&rsquo;s fun. Yes, you get to challenge your shooting skills on a great match, but you also get to spend four days surrounded by some of the best people in the firearms community. The people who shoot the Bianchi Cup each year are close knit&mdash;everyone knows everyone, and yet it&rsquo;s extremely welcoming of new shooters.</p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[More than Marksmanship]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>Ten year olds were playing checkers, Uno ruled the main hallway, and a group of 8 year olds were constructing a house of cards with more square feet and floors than my current home. Smartphones, iPads and videogames were mysteriously absent. The politeness ran thick in the group of more than 2,000 people and 54 teams of young shooters from across the nation crowded into the Rogers, Ark., convention center.</p><p>Conversations ruled&mdash;not text messages&mdash;last weekend at <a href="http://www.ibbgcm.com" target="_blank">the 48th Annual Daisy National BB Gun Championship Matches</a>. The anti-gun crowd prefers to ignore the evidence, but the shooting sports promote social skills and instill discipline, honor, integrity and respect in the youths who participate. Concentration skills are even polished, and that often reflects positively in their schoolwork.</p><p>In four days, with multiple relays and hundreds of Daisy BB guns going back and forth to the firing line, I never once had a gun pointed toward me or my camera. That&rsquo;s discipline, particularly with youngsters between the ages of eight and 15 who are competing in the oldest and most prestigious competition of its kind in the world.</p><p>Fingers stayed off triggers until the range went hot. Shooters in the next relay waited patiently and quietly in a chair staged behind the firing line. When&rsquo;s the last time you saw a kid this age sit, with barely a fidget, for 10 minutes (shooting time), plus setup time and practice with nothing else to do but watch a teammate? I&rsquo;d enroll my youngest grandson if my county <a href="http://www.4-h.org" target="_blank">4-H</a> had a shooting program. </p><p>In regard to honor and integrity, consider the actions of one competitor last year. He turned himself in after he thought he delivered a shot a nano-second after a short cease fire. No one else apparently agreed, including the range officer. But he insisted, endured the penalty and this year Daisy rolled out the Daisy Sportsmanship Scholarship in honor of his integrity. It went to Elisabeth Keeler, who helped lead her team back to the championships despite breaking her arm, breaking her hand, helping an elderly woman who lives nearby, knitting Afghans, giving them to the needy, and a lot more. </p><p>Part of the competition includes a safety exam, and it weighs toward their overall scores. One mother told me when she signed up her youngster and attended the first practice it was nothing like what she expected&mdash;one hour of shooting practice and another hour in the classroom was a surprise. </p><p>Targets are 5 meters from the shooter, or roughly 15 feet. The 10-ring is only .125 inch, as dictated by the NRA Rules. To put that into perspective, a dime has roughly a .7-inch diameter. The 9-ring is .425 inch and a spring-loaded gun like the <a href="http://www.daisy.com/node/106" target="_blank">Avanti Champion Model 499</a> is used. With a ballistic coefficient rivaling a piece of pumice, the .177-caliber round BB leaves the barrel at a &ldquo;scalding&rdquo; 240 fps. There is no rifling and, oh yes, as if all this doesn&rsquo;t make things a bit challenging, only iron sights are allowed. And the kids hit the bull&rsquo;s eye with scary regularity. That should be the Webster&rsquo;s definition for precision and concentration. </p><p>The short distance involved and low velocity also makes it easy for parents to construct practice ranges at home. Jarrett Bialas, from Armour, SD, was at the event to watch his two sons compete. His small range in the garage is where you&rsquo;ll find them shooting many nights, together, away from television, videogames and the Internet. </p><p>Quality time with parents is a good thing, but according to Stacey Miron from Sioux Falls, SD, her son&rsquo;s shooting has positively impacted his schoolwork. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s taught him if you study, you get a better grade or score.&rdquo; Fifteen-year-old Kendra Jacobs probably gave the best adult-like summary among all the young shooters I interviewed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of life lessons you can learn from it,&rdquo; she said. </p><p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, every youth who had to battle their way through state finals to qualify, families, coaches and those at Daisy who took part in this event are all winners. So I won&rsquo;t name the official honorees (friend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DaisyOutdoor?fref=ts" target="_blank">Daisy Outdoor</a> on Facebook if you&rsquo;re really curious). </p><p>Daisy helps underwrite the travel expenses of each team, and planning for next year&rsquo;s event is already underway. It&rsquo;s a huge financial and manpower undertaking for the company, one in which it rightfully takes a great deal of pride. Every person I spoke to agreed the company&rsquo;s efforts are making a huge difference. </p><p>This blog may not provide details on some sort of new gun gizmo, but my discovery last weekend is every bit as exciting. The youthful pleasure of BB guns, including the <a href="http://www.daisy.com/node/49" target="_blank">Red Ryder</a>, isn&rsquo;t dead. They may not be fashionable enough to garner much press from the mainstream media, but the magnetism that captured us all continues to work its magic.</p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[How to Read Center-Fire Ammunition Boxes]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>7/2/13</p><p>I was just a couple of years into my handgun shooting career when a family member was kind enough to buy a couple of boxes of ammunition for my birthday. They had driven all the way across town to find what I wanted. When the present was unwrapped, there was an unfortunate sense of disappointment. The handgun in need of ammunition was a .38 Spl. revolver. The not-so-cheap ammunition in the package was .38 Super, a semi-automatic pistol cartridge that wouldn’t fit.</p><p>When it was pointed out that I could just exchange the semi-auto cartridges for revolver cartridges, I had to explain that most stores have policies in place preventing the return or exchange of ammunition. This is because firearm cartridges are explosive devices that can be tampered with, altered, or exchanged for an inferior product. If a cartridge malfunctions and causes damage to a gun, or the person shooting it, then liability issues come into play. Since there is no way for a store clerk to verify that the exact same cartridges that walked out of their location are walking back in to it, they stick with the simple and safe policy of no returns.</p><p>So what should you do if you need to buy ammunition, but shooting is not your forte? The best way to avoid the expense and frustration of buying the wrong ammunition is to know what you are looking for before heading out to the sporting goods store. Most modern firearms have the ammunition type stamped on them in a visible location. Usually it's somewhere on the barrel or the frame. If you have a gun that doesn’t have clear ammunition markings, then take it to an experienced gunsmith to properly identify the right ammunition.</p><p>The same caliber and cartridge information stamped on the gun will be included on an ammunition box label, even if it is a bit cryptic. The following tips will help you determine what information a label provides, and how to identify differences in cartridges of the same caliber. This is not an exhaustive ammunition guide, but it should be enough information to get you through a trip to the store.</p><p>The following photo shows an ammunition label and the major categories of information included on a center-fire ammunition box (we'll save rimfire ammunition and shotgun shells for another day):</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/02_RAB_30-30_Diagram_s.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24367" title="02_RAB_30-30_Diagram_s" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/02_RAB_30-30_Diagram_s.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="275" /></a></p><p><strong>Ammunition Brand:</strong></p><p>Ammunition is a branded product made by several different companies. This means the name of the manufacturer is often, but not always, a dominant feature of the label. Many shooters develop a brand preference once they learn which ammunition functions best in their particular firearm, so which brand you buy can be important if you are purchasing a gift for someone else.</p><p><strong>Bullet Diameter &amp; Cartridge Name:</strong></p><p>The diameter of a bullet, or how wide it is across its circular base, is used as a defining feature of the cartridge name to make quick ammo identification easy. Similar calibers are usually grouped together on dealers’ shelves. Bullet diameter is usually represented on a box using one of two measurement systems: Caliber or Millimeters.</p><p><strong>Caliber</strong>, the more common measurement for ammunition developed in the United States, is a decimal point representation of hundredths of an inch. In the example photo, the bullet has a 0.38-inch diameter, so it would be said to be a .38-caliber bullet. When saying the name out loud, the decimal is left out, “ I would like a box of thirty-eight Special ammo, please.” Sometimes bullet caliber is displayed to two decimal points (.38 Special, .44 Magnum, .45 ACP) or to three decimal points (.223 Remington, .357 Ruger, .327 Federal).</p><p>The other measurement system used for bullet width is <strong>Millimeters</strong>. This tends to be applied to cartridges developed overseas. Bullet diameter in Millimeters can be displayed as a whole number (9 mm, 10 mm) or as a decimal point (7.62 Tokarev, 6.5 Creedmoor).</p><p>Most of the modern ammunition available today will be loaded with bullets ranging from the very small .17 Caliber bullets to large .50 Caliber projectiles. Why is the bullet diameter so important? A cartridge with a bullet that is too large for the gun will not fit into its chamber, while a cartridge with a bullet that's too small will rattle around the barrel as it flies down the barrel and produce rotten accuracy. More importantly, loading the wrong cartridge into a gun may cause it to literally explode. There are no approximations when it comes to ammunition. The caliber numbers on the box must match the numbers on the gun exactly.</p><p>The full name of the cartridge may, or may not, have more to it than the bullet caliber. For example, the 9 mm Luger cartridge is often shortened to just 9 mm, or the word following the caliber is abbreviated to conserve space on the label. Cartridge names often include the name of the individual who invented it (.475 Linebaugh), the gun company that developed it (.30-.30 Winchester), or a descriptive term (.221 Fireball).</p><p><strong>Bullet Weight:</strong></p><p>In most cases, bullet weight is represented in Grains. This is an archaic unit of measurement that's not commonly used any more. It takes 437.5 Grains to equal an Ounce, and the larger the number of Grains listed on the box, the heavier the bullet will be. Grains can be spelled out completely on a label, or abbreviated (Grain, Gr, gr, gr.). However it's represented, the letters G and R will be in there somewhere. Shooters pay attention to how light or heavy a bullet is because the weight changes the performance down range.</p><p><strong>Bullet Style:</strong>How a bullet is shaped, and what it's made of, will affect how it behaves when striking an intended target. Far too many bullet style abbreviations are available to list here, especially since manufacturers keep developing new ones. But here are a few common abbreviations used for handgun and rifle ammunition:</p><p><strong>- FMJ (Full-Metal Jacket):</strong> A lead bullet wrapped, or "jacketed," in a thin covering of copper or brass along the top and sides, leaving the base exposed. Jacketed bullets can have a rounded or flat-nose shape. Copper is soft, but it doesn't melt like lead does at high velocity, so the jacket makes the bullet much stronger and allows it to travel much faster. These bullets are commonly used in practice grade ammunition.</p><p><strong>- TMJ (Total-Metal Jacket): </strong>The same idea as a Full-Metal Jacket, but the base of the bullet is covered in copper as well.</p><p><strong>- JSP (Jacketed-Soft Point):</strong> A bullet with the sides jacketed in copper, but the lead nose of the core is left exposed in order to allow the bullet to expand when it hits the target. These tend to be used for hunting.</p><p><strong>- SJHP (Semi-Jacketed Hollow Point): </strong>The same design as the Jacketed Soft Point, but a cavity, or "hollow" is cut or molded into the nose of the bullet. The combination of the exposed lead and the hollow point cause the bullet to expand more rapidly. These bullets are commonly used for self defense and hunting.</p><p><strong>- JHP (Jacketed Hollow Point):</strong> This is the most popular type of self defense and hunting bullet on the market. Imagine a Full Metal Jacket bullet that has a hole drilled in the nose, so that the jacket covers the whole bullet, but there is a cavity in the nose. Several designs are available, all of which are intended to allow the bullet to expand rapidly.</p><p><strong>- FRAN (Frangible):</strong> A relatively recent addition, these bullets are made of compressed metallic dust. They look like Full Metal Jacket bullets, but they are supposed to disintegrate back into dust when they hit a solid target. This disintegration is intended to reduce the chances of ricochet or over penetration. These are popular for use at indoor ranges and as training rounds.</p><p><em>*Performance Data:</p><p></em>Some companies may add a bit of performance data on a label to keep things interesting. For example, some pistol ammunition is marked with a "+P". This indicates the cartridge inside generates more pressure than some handguns are designed to handle. You might also see bullet velocity (1,050 fps) and bullet energy (269 ft./lbs.) information listed on the label. Velocity and energy information are not usually needed to identify a correct cartridge for your gun, but it’s helpful to know what the extra numbers and markings mean.</p><p>The Black Hills ammunition label below is from a center-fire handgun ammunition box. The same information presentation is used for center-fire rifle ammunition as well:</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/01_RAB_38Box_Diagram_s21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24360" title="01_RAB_38Box_Diagram_s[2]" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/01_RAB_38Box_Diagram_s21.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="259" /></a></p><p>Earlier it was mentioned that ammunition companies like to have their boxes stand out, so one of the things they do is move around and change the abbreviations for the information on the labels. Here is the Black Hills Ammunition .38 Spl. box again, but shown with other brands as well:</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/03_RAB_6-38bxs_s.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24361" title="03_RAB_6-38bxs_s" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/03_RAB_6-38bxs_s.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="220" /></a></p><p>Each of these labels display the manufacturer, caliber and cartridge name, bullet weight and bullet style, but with some variations. Most read from the top down, but HPR places their name and the cartridge information side-by-side. The Black Hills box shows the bullet caliber with a decimal point, the others delete the decimal and rely on the word Special to let buyers know what the cartridge is. The Hornady boxes abbreviate the cartridge name (SPCL) while the others spell it out completely. The blue and white box in the lower left corner is from Cor-Bon, but they chose to let their label colors do the talking and emphasized the DPX bullet style instead of their company name. The Cor-Bon box is the only one with velocity and energy data, but four boxes are marked as +P.</p><p>Take a look at the two Hornady boxes on the right. At first glance, they look nearly identical. However, subtle differences in the labeling provide important information. The top box, with the yellow Hornady Custom label bar, is from a different line of ammunition than the black bar Critical Defense line, which means they use different bullet styles. The Custom box does not have a +P mark, while the Critical Defense load does. This means the Custom load should be safe to fire in most well maintained .38 Special revolvers, while the Critical Defense load is limited to those guns rated for P+ ammunition. The Custom round has a heavier 125-grain XTP bullet style, while the other is a lighter 110-grain FTX. In other words, the two Hornady loads are the same in the sense that two cups of coffee are both filled with coffee, but one is a Latte while the other is an Espresso.</p><p>When I was working at a sporting goods store in college, I sometimes met with customers who arrived with partial ammunition information, which made filling their needs a challenge. They would say, "I'm looking for some Magnum ammunition," or "I'm trying to find some .45 ammunition." It's important to know the complete name of the cartridge because different cartridges can share the same bullet diameter or naming elements. Take a look at the following photo:</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/04_RAB_357_44_45_Boxed_s.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24363" title="04_RAB_357_44_45_Boxed_s" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/04_RAB_357_44_45_Boxed_s.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="170" /></a></p><p>On the left are two cartridge boxes labeled with .357 bullet diameters, with two .44s in the middle, and two .45s on the right. The boxes are also similar in size and labeling. Now take a look at the cartridges each contains:</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/05_RAB_357_44_45_Unboxed_s.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24364" title="05_RAB_357_44_45_Unboxed_s" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/05_RAB_357_44_45_Unboxed_s.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="321" /></a></p><p>Despite their similar name elements, these cartridges have little in common with each other. The .357 Mag. and the .44 Mag. have different diameters. The term "Magnum" is an indicator that these cartridges are larger than, or derived from, a similar cartridge. This is the relationship between the .44 Mag. and .44 Spl. The .44 Spl. was developed first, and then the cartridge was lengthened a bit and packed with more powder to form the more powerful .44 Mag. load. The .357 Mag. is a revolver cartridge, while the .357 Sig is what's known as a "bottle neck" semi-auto cartridge. The .45 ACP is a semi-auto cartridge commonly fired in 1911-style semi-auto pistols, while the venerable .45 Colt can be found in old fashioned, cowboy-action shooting revolvers.</p><p>If you are buying a gift for a shooter, and all of this ammunition box label information is a bit too much to take in or remember, then talk to the person for whom you're buying ammunition. Ask them to write down exactly what they want (manufacturer, cartridge name, bullet weight, bullet style). Or, use that snazzy cell phone camera to take a picture of the labels on the boxes of ammunition they already have. That way you can just show it to the clerk and avoid any confusion.</p><p>If you are new to shooting, then now is the time to get to know your firearm better. You can begin the process of exploring how different ammunition brands, bullet weights, and bullet styles perform in your gun. When breaking in a new gun, it’s best to buy just one box each of several different brands until you find the brands that are the most accurate and reliable in your firearm.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Passengers were picked up by a limousine driver and driven to a nightclub. Afterward, the party was taken to a convenience store. Two vehicles followed the limousine from the convenience store and pulled up on either side of the limo forcing the chauffeur to stop. There was an attempted robbery during which bullets riddled the limousine. Two passengers sustained non-life-threatening injuries. The chauffeur, who has a concealed carry permit, returned fire, fending off the attackers.

The husband and father, Javier Ortiz, pulled out his own firearm and fatally wounded two of the suspects. The third ran for his life.

              <title><![CDATA[Support-Hand Shooting]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><em>7/1/2013</em></p><p>Once a shooter has developed some skill in the basics of defensive shooting, it is time to learn to shoot with the support hand. There can be many reasons for needing to return fire with the support hand. The strong hand may have been injured and no longer has the strength to manipulate the handgun, or the strong hand may be engaged in holding on to something, or someone. And it is also possible that the attacker may have grabbed hold of the strong hand in order to prevent the defensive shooter from getting a handgun into action.</p><p>Support-hand shooting begins with a look at the defensive holster. The holster should be of a design that allows the shooter to reach a handgun with either hand. Even if the holster is carried on the strong-side hip, the shooter should be able to reach behind the back, or across the front (whichever is easiest) and get the handgun into action. For this reason, the location that the holster is worn, and any safety straps or devices, should be considered when holster selection is being made. This is one of the reasons that I prefer an open-topped holster, without thumbsnaps or other locking devices, for concealed carry.</p><p>Drawing the handgun with the support hand is a relatively slow proposition regardless of where the handgun is worn. However, dry practice will allow the defensive shooter to develop a smooth, if not fast, support-hand presentation. Be sure to practice this draw stroke with an unloaded handgun. In fact, it's best to remove all of the ammunition from the room where practice is being conducted. Check and double check the handgun to make sure it is actually unloaded. And, once you have left the practice area and reloaded the handgun don't fall into the trap of trying one more presentation. When dry practice is over, it is over, period.</p><p>Whether a person reaches behind the back or across the front to get a shooting grip on the handgun depends upon individual build and arm length. If it can be accomplished, reaching behind the back is to be preferred because a person can get somewhat of a shooting grip on the handgun immediately. As the gun is being drawn across the back, special attention should be given to make sure that the gun is slightly canted, with the muzzle pointed away from the body. If the pistol has a thumb safety, the index finger can be used to disengage the safety as the muzzle is being indexed toward the threat.</p><p>If the shooter has to reach the handgun from across the front of the body he or she will generally end up with the gun in an upside down hold. It must then be held against the body for a proper shooting grip to be obtained. Obviously, the chance of fumbling the handgun, or even dropping it, is much greater. Still, for some folks, that is the only way to get the handgun from the holster into the support hand. In this case, even more dry practice is required to develop the skill to a useful level.</p><p>Since the support hand is being used because the strong hand is disabled, or otherwise occupied, the shots are delivered one handed. However, this does not call for point shooting. The handgun should still be held at eye level and the sights used, just as in two-handed shooting. The arm should be almost straight without locking the elbow. The front sight should be clearly in focus as the shots are delivered.</p><p>Some find that by canting the handgun slightly inward the wrist is locked and recoil can be managed a bit better. We are not talking about the “Gangster Hold,” where the handgun is turned on its side. The handgun is canted only slightly, just enough to lock the wrist and manage the recoil.</p><p>Even though the shooter is using the support hand, he or she should make every effort to sight with the dominant eye. For most shooters, the dominant eye is on the strong side of the body. Simply cocking the head slightly toward the support side will allow the use of the dominant eye.</p><p>Obviously, a person is not going to be very fast when shooting with the support hand. And a good deal of practice is required in order for the movements to become smooth. However, smooth is what a person should work to obtain. And the vast majority of that practice should be dry practice, with an unloaded handgun, to avoid fumbling the gun and having a negligent discharge.</p><p>Finally, support-hand shooting is not a fast-draw technique so much as it is a survival technique. It allows the defensive shooter to stay in the fight. And, by staying in the fight, he or she has a chance to win that fight.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PSCl6dsrO-0" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Kahr Makes a Move]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><span>After Governor Andrew Cuomo railroaded the Draconian &ldquo;Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act of 2013&rdquo; through both houses of New York legislature in Albany&mdash;in which the oppressive bill wasn&rsquo;t even allowed the normal legislative comment and inspection period&mdash;<span>many wondered when Kahr Arms would make a move. We received our answer today. Kahr Arms, which also includes Auto-Ordnance and Magnum Research, will be &ldquo;expanding its corporate offices and engineering department into Pike County, Pa., which is about an hour-and-a-half west of its current location in Pearl River, N.Y. Kahr is buying 620 acres from the Pike County Industrial Park Development Group/Business Development Corporation. The site is near Scranton, and construction is said to start as early as this year. Both Kahr&rsquo;s manufacturing plants&mdash;<span>one in Worchester, Mass., and the other in Pillager, Minn.&mdash;are working at full capacity and are not included in the move, although Kahr plans to eventually expand manufacturing to the Pennsylvania site.</p><p>The company&rsquo;s release is telling.</p><p>&ldquo;We are grateful for the warm welcome and the business opportunity extended by the Pike County Industrial Park Development Group/Business Development Corporation to expand our company and relocate its headquarters office,&rdquo; stated VP of Sales and Marketing, Frank Harris. &ldquo;The Pennsylvania group has demonstrated tremendous support of our operations and Kahr looks to move forward with the project without delay. It&rsquo;s good for our business and also for other businesses in the area as we build a long-term mutually beneficial relationship with the community. We anticipate generating significant numbers of revenue and jobs for the local Northeastern Pennsylvania economy with the construction of facilities, expansion of manufacturing, and need for local vendors.&rdquo;</p><p>In case you didn&rsquo;t know, you can actually put 10 rounds in a 10-round capacity magazine in Pennsylvania without facing imprisonment by Cuomo&rsquo;s goons. I&rsquo;m sure that didn&rsquo;t occur to executives at Kahr. Nah, I&rsquo;m sure it didn&rsquo;t factor into their decision at all.</p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Ambush Rifles 300 Blackout]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><em>7/11/2013</em></p><p>The AR is a rugged and reliable platform that has proved its capabilities on the battlefield for 50 years, but its 5.56x45 mm (.223 Rem.) chambering is considered to be on the smaller end of the power spectrum by many shooters. While popular, the standard AR round is basically considered a varmint round that is illegal for hunting deer in many states. Of course, AR rifles and its variations can be obtained in larger calibers, such as .300 AAC Blackout. </p><p>The .300 AAC Blackout was developed by <a href="http://www.advanced-armament.com/" target="_blank">Advanced Armament Corp.</a> as a more-powerful caliber for AR-15 (M4) rifles using standard magazines without sacrificing ammo capacity. It was designed primarily for Special Forces units needing better performance in their rifles for specialized missions. It provides the knockdown of a .30-caliber bullet without a huge increase in recoil, and can reliably run in both suppressed and unsuppressed rifles.</p><p>It didn’t take long though for civilian shooters to realize the benefits of the .300 AAC Blackout, and manufacturers like Daniel Defense began producing rifles in this caliber. Not long after hunters also began wanting an AR in this chambering, leading Daniel Defense to produce a rifle in .300 AAC Blackout under its hunting brand <a href="https://ambushfirearms.com/" target="_blank">Ambush Firearms</a>. </p><p>The Ambush 300 Blackout is a gas-impingement semi-auto in the standard M4 configuration, including its controls. The safety, magazine release and bolt catch are all located in the standard locations. It’s listed as multi-caliber as it fires both .300 AAC Blackout and .300 Whisper ammunition, and since everything but the barrel is the same as Daniel Defense’s 5.56 rifles, the barrel can be swapped for additional calibers. It features a 16-inch cold-hammer forged barrel with a salt-bath nitride finish with 1:8-inch twist rifling.</p><p>It features a two-piece Picatinny rail along the top of the receiver with indexing marks for attaching optics in the same position every time, along with three, 2.5-inch Picatinny rail sections on the front of the modular float rail for mounting lights, lasers, bipods and other accessories. The rifle is available in <a href="http://www.mossyoak.com/" target="_blank">Mossy Oak</a> Break Up Infinity, Mossy Oak Blaze Pink, <a href="http://www.realtree.com/" target="_blank">Realtree</a> AP and standard black, and comes with a <a href="http://www.magpul.com/" target="_blank">Magpul</a> MOE buttstock, and what Ambush calls a “shotgun inspired modular hand grip.”</p><p>The hand grip is a very nice touch, and even though it is made of plastic, it provides a little bit of the wood feel of a <a href="http://www.remington.com/" target="_blank">Remington</a> 870 to the 300 Blackout, making it more comfortable to shoot, both from support and freehand positions. As I have never really liked how an AR’s forearm felt in my support hand when firing, but never considered it a major issue for an otherwise great platform, I kind of wish all ARs had this hand grip. </p><p>Other features on the 300 Blackout include some inspired by the needs of Special Forces rather than hunters, such as a threaded barrel for attaching a suppressor, with a protector on the end, and a charging handle that is more easily accessible when using optics. The Mossy Oak finish on the test model was smooth and well applied, though the deflector quickly showed signs of the finish chipping once shooting began.  </p><p>The 300 Blackout breaks down just like any AR-15 rifle, and comes with a single five-round PMAG magazine, which makes sense as many states limit magazine capacity for hunting. However, the included PMAG had a very tight fit, causing problems with both insertion and removal. Luckily, standard 5.56x45 mm AR magazines also work, such as the TangoDown and standard metal magazines also used during testing. </p><p>As for accuracy, the Ambush 300 Blackout was excellent with multiple consecutive five-shot groups measuring under an inch with three different loads. A large part of this was due to the excellent two-stage trigger that started with just a little bit of un-resisted take-up before breaking at just over 4 pounds. </p><p>The best load was <a href="http://www.hornady.com/" target="_blank">Hornady’s</a> .300 Whisper 110-grain V-MAX load with a best group of .7 inches and an average of .92 inches at 100 yards from a rest. This combination also obtained a 1.62-inch 15-round group at 50 yards. </p><p>The 110-grain load also performed best in function as both of the subsonic loads-Hornady’s .300 Whisper 208-grain A-MAX and <a href="http://www.federalpremium.com/" target="_blank">Federal’s</a> 220-grain .300 AAC Blackout-had issues with both loading and ejecting because of the heavier bullets and lower velocity, with the Federal load having the most issues. This was to be expected as Ambush claims that firing subsonic loads un-suppressed can cause failures to feed, failures to eject and failures to fire. Testing proved this to be true, but talking with a representative of Daniel Defense revealed that they had recently “tweaked” the gas system to better run with subsonic loads. Even having to load each round individually, the Federal loads showed excellent accuracy, averaging just over an inch at 100 yards, while the Hornady 208-grain load averaged 1.3 inches. </p><p>Unfortunately, accuracy testing was about all I was able to perform due to limited quantities of available ammunition. I ripped the last two boxes of the Hornady 110-grain loads in drills to check out functionality and reliability, but 40 rounds just don’t do the gun justice. Those 40 rounds did show that the rifle works well with loads that break the 1,100 fps sound barrier, and that recoil can be managed quite well with a .30-caliber bullet. </p><p>That .30-caliber bullet gives the Ambush 300 Blackout accuracy and knock-down, and its excellent features make it a prime choice for hunters desiring more power in an AR-type rifle. And for those wanting a suppressed culling gun, there just might not be a better choice. </p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Ambush Firearms; <a href="https://ambushfirearms.com/" target="_blank">Ambushfirearms.com</a></p><p><strong>Model:</strong> 300 Blackout</p><p><strong>Caliber:</strong> .300 AAC Blackout</p><p><strong>Finish:</strong> Mossy Oak Break Up Infinity (Also available in Realtree AP, Mossy Oak Blaze Pink and black)</p><p><strong>Action:</strong> gas impingement semi-auto</p><p><strong>Receiver:</strong> 7075 Mil-Spec aluminum</p><p><strong>Rifling:</strong> 1:8” RH twist</p><p><strong>Barrel:</strong> 16” Cold hammer forged</p><p><strong>Magazine:</strong> five-round PMAG</p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> none, Picatinny rail for optics</p><p><strong>Trigger: </strong>two-stage Geissele Super Semi-automatic; 4.39 lbs.</p><p><strong>Stock: </strong>Magpul MOE Buttstock</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 6.9 lbs.</p><p><strong>Accessories:</strong> manual, hard plastic case</p><p><strong>Suggested Retail Price:</strong> $1,759</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>&ldquo;Gun Geo Marker,&rdquo; a free app that went live on July 4, runs on Android smartphones and allows people to &ldquo;Geolocate Dangerous Guns and Owners.&rdquo; The creator&rsquo;s <a href="http://gungeomarker.org/" target="_blank">blog</a> indicates the<a href="http://gungeomarker.org/2013/07/04/now-the-gun-geo-marker-app-is-live-at-google-play/" target="_blank"> holiday launch date was deliberate</a>. </p><p>Less than 1,000 people have downloaded the app at the Google store, although the system is simple enough developers hope it will catch on. Open the app and the phone&rsquo;s GPS determines your location. A crosshair then plots your position on a map and you&rsquo;re asked to wait while it determines if there are any guns that have been geotagged nearby. If not, a &ldquo;Good News&rdquo; screen appears.</p><p>A yellow bar at the bottom allows users to anonymously mark any site they&rsquo;re at, but there is a one-tag-a-day limit enforced by an encrypted code sent back to the phone. The device ID stays on servers for only that day and secrecy is doubly ensured because, &ldquo;&hellip;should anyone ever subpoena our records they would only gain access to the data that existed on the particular day the subpoena was honored&hellip;.&rdquo; The group&rsquo;s full <a href="http://gungeomarker.org/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">privacy/anonymity explanation</a> has more details. </p><p>Mark a spot, provide a description of the gun or activity and a yellow marker will appear to &ldquo;warn&rdquo; other users. Some of the reasons suggested in the <a href="http://gungeomarker.org/gun-marking-guidelines/" target="_blank">instructions for tagging</a> a location include loaded firearms, unsecured firearms, first-time gun owners, a large collection, so-called &ldquo;assault weapons&rdquo; and I quote, &ldquo;Neighborhood talk, unsafe.&rdquo; </p><p>Even the <a href="http://visarts.ucsd.edu/faculty/brett-stalbaum" target="_blank">brains behind the program</a> admits it&rsquo;s &ldquo;tattle ware,&rdquo; but the lecturer at the University of California, San Diego, stands behind the app. When one article compared his software to religious persecution, the website response was, &ldquo;True enough, if your religion requires live child sacrifices to appease a cold, tubular god.&rdquo; The main developer&rsquo;s bio notes include a reference in regard to the software he developed in 1998 for the Electronic Disturbance Theater that, according to Forbes Magazine, was used by the Zapatistas to, &ldquo;Perhaps launch the first electronic attack against a target on U.S. soil...&rdquo; Partnering in the new app is Walking Tools Project, developers of software that includes the <a href="http://www.walkingtools.net/?page_id=14" target="_blank">Transborder Immigrant Tool</a>, a self-professed response to immigration policy. </p><p>I didn&rsquo;t violate someone else&rsquo;s rights by tagging someplace, but in function testing, the map appeared rudimentary, at best, response when moving was lethargic and with the app open the Droid crashed twice. Users must also be on the property they wish to tag, although the satellite-based GPS system works at night, which could be a concern in regard to trespassing or theft. </p><p>The download site had only three comments registered as of press time, with the possibility for abuse a common theme. One Droid user summarized the reactions best by posting, &ldquo;Some idiot went and marked my granny's grave. I mean, how in the world did they know that I had ol&rsquo; granny cremated so I could use the grave to hide all my weapons? That was a total secret.&rdquo;<br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>To help the competitors with the longest shot ever tried on Top Shot, producers brought back George Reinas, who was the only shooter to nail the 1,000-yard target in Season Two. He didn’t win that day, but it truly showed the skill of the trained sniper.</p><p>This time, the remaining competitors used a Barrett MRAD in .338 Lapua Mag. to take out an exploding target placed at 1,760 yards (1 mile), and Reinas helped fine tune the skills needed for such a long shot. It was interesting to see Jamie and George together again, as George was one of the main instigators against Jamie during the second season; I’m pretty sure I saw some resentment on Jamie’s face as he walked up to practice, and can’t help but wonder if that was “planned” by the producers. It was also neat to see that Jamie was the only competitor to take out the target in one shot, and he did it in the fastest time, too, winning an <a href="http://www.oculusoptics.com/scope/durability" target="_blank">Oculus</a> scope from <a href="http://www.basspro.com/" target="_blank">Bass Pro Shops</a>. </p><p>The second slot went to long-range rifle expert Kelly, which is a little sad considering that this should have been his event. Most of the shooters did fairly well though; I’m scared to think about how long or how many shots it would have taken me to complete this challenge, but four competitors took more than a minute to turn the target into a fireball and were sent to the Proving Ground. </p><p>Alex, Brian, Joe and Peter tried to center punch a target at 60 yards with an 1860 Henry, but the only one to get close was Joe, who incidentally was the only one not sent to the Elimination Challenge where the situation went back in time from one of the most high-tech rifles available to one of the first extended-distant weapons in history-the Atlatl. </p><p>Primitive weapons specialist Joe Dagger was of the opinion that the chosen three were fairly well prepared, but in this challenge, strategy proved more important than skill with the Atlatl. Peter quickly showed that he understood that by increase the pressure on his compatriots with a couple of successful throws at the closest target. And while Brian Zims might be one of the best pistol shooters in the world, he got greedy with the Atlatl and tried for the middle target when he could have ended the game with a hit on the close target. This forced a tie breaker that Brian eventually won, requiring Alex to say goodbye. </p><p>The current season is great for those who just want to see cool shots made with awesome guns, and the competitors jerked from their comfort zones with outlandish primitive weapons. But I will admit that I would have loved to hear Jamie’s thoughts on seeing George again. Maybe I do want a little drama. Of course, I’m still rooting for Jamie and Kelly, and hope one wins it all. Who are you rooting for, and why?</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Off-Body Carry Methods For Women]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>7/9/13</em></p><p><strong>More Than Meets The Eye</strong> Most people immediately think of a purse when it comes to off-body carry  for women, but that is not the only option, and it might not even be  the best option. There are a number of choices when it comes to carrying  a gun and all kinds of reasons for them. But one size does not fit all  here. Even if the concept of &ldquo;size&rdquo; is more figurative than literal, and  the gun is being carried off-the-body.</p><p>If your activity and/or mode of dress make it impractical to wear the gun on the body, various <a href="http://www.designerconcealedcarry.com/cgi-bin/waa1gate.isa?WAA_PACKAGE=BDS&amp;WAA_FORM=LIST_BDSLISTINGS&amp;C=0000000004MV&amp;U=%7C%7E%7C"><strong>purses</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.tuffproducts.com/product.php?productid=17536&amp;cat=281&amp;page=1"><strong>pouches</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.maxpedition.com/store/pc/Versipacks-c4.htm"><strong>packs</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.guntotenmamas.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?search=action&amp;category=SBOO"><strong>bags</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.usgalco.com/HolsterPG3.asp?ProductID=2769&amp;GunID=556"><strong>calendars</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.blackhawk.com/product/Advanced-Tactical-Briefcase,135,1394.htm"><strong>briefcases</strong></a> and more can offer a very viable means of carrying a firearm in a  discrete and undetectable manner. However, regardless of what &ldquo;device&rdquo;  you choose or what style it might follow, there are a number of serious  concerns about each that need to be addressed.</p><p>If designed and utilized correctly, no one should ever even know that  you have a gun in any of these carriers. But the dilemma is that the  more they look and perform like what they are supposed to be (containers  for the sometimes valuable and important items we carry with us every  day), the more that they can become the motivation for the deadly force  event that requires the use of the weapon they hold. And that&rsquo;s because  they are subject to theft.</p><p>Suddenly, the means of concealing your firearm can become one of the  reasons you might need it. I am certainly not saying that by carrying  the gun you are purposely or unintentionally causing such an event. I am  merely saying that if you are attacked and the specifically designed <a href="http://www.usgalco.com/HolsterP2.asp?CatalogID=149"><strong>purse</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.guntotenmamas.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?search=action&amp;category=WHOO"><strong>bag</strong></a>, or <a href="http://www.unclemikes.com/bags-cases/utility-bags/briefcase-with-hidden-holster"><strong>briefcase</strong></a> you are using to carry your firearm becomes involved, there is not only  the chance that you might lose your gun instead of being able to use it  but in struggling to maintain possession, the act of drawing it at all  can be greatly impeded.</p><p>If you choose (or have no choice but to use) a <a href="http://www.theconcealmentshop.com/Elite.php"><strong>purse</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.maxpedition.com/store/pc/SPATHA-Laptop-Case-13p1894.htm"><strong>bag</strong></a>, or <a href="http://www.blackhawk.com/product/Covert-Carry-Messenger-Bag,1185,1394.htm"><strong>briefcase</strong></a> to carry a handgun with you, you not only need to be aware that someone  can now attack you for that carrier (without even knowing that there&rsquo;s a  gun inside) but you must also plan and practice for what to do if that  happens.</p><p>Additionally, you need to look at the carrier itself and decide if its appearance might work against you.</p><p>For example, is your purse too upscale for where you&rsquo;re going or how  you&rsquo;re dressed? Conversely, does it look too much like a gun bag than  something that someone would normally take to work, or perhaps along to  dinner or out shopping? Does that urban backpack look like something  you&rsquo;d wear while walking, cycling or riding the bus? Or do you look  instead like you&rsquo;re on a Military Op, rather than on a trip downtown?  Does your briefcase look far too expensive for the job or way too  tactical for a civilian? There is a reason that most enforcement  agencies call this &ldquo;concealed&rdquo; and not &ldquo;broadcast it to the world&rdquo; carry  and you must remember that.</p><p>However, there is a difference between keeping a low profile and not  attracting attention, while still not appearing too demure, weak or  victim-like. Obviously swaggering with something more intended for  police work than a trip to the market is definitely the wrong approach,  but so is being so low key that you&rsquo;ll get singled out as a target.</p><p><strong>What You See Isn&rsquo;t Always What You &ldquo;Got&rdquo;</strong> Nowhere else does the overworked term &ldquo;Hidden In Plain Sight&rdquo; apply more  in this business than it does to the area of &ldquo;Off-Body&rdquo; carry methods  and equipment. As legal, civilian concealed carry has become more common  throughout the United States, the job of obscuring a gun from view,  while still making it not only readily accessible but also readily  producible, has become more difficult. Fortunately, a number of  manufacturers have been up to the task.</p><p>If the gun cannot be fastened to the torso, belt, leg or ankle, and  if it cannot be tucked into your waistband or slipped into a pocket,  toting it along in some sort of &ldquo;outboard&rdquo; device often becomes  necessary. While movies and television often feature inventive and  unusual ways of doing this, we need to separate fact from fiction when  carrying a gun in real life.</p><p>For decades, fanny packs were the choice for both men and women  carrying guns, while dressed casually and without the aid of covering  garments. In my opinion, however, most of them should have been  abandoned at least 15 years ago, but they are still around. For gun  savvy people (and I would hope, all law enforcement officials), such  bags scream &ldquo;GUN IN HERE&rdquo; as glaringly as those &ldquo;Baby on Board&rdquo; signs  once did in our vehicles. They have also become dated in regard to  certain age groups and activities.</p><p>However, they could have some applications for older people with whom such carriers like this one from <a href="http://www.unclemikes.com/holsters/belt-pouches/compact-fanny-pack"><strong>Uncle Mike&rsquo;s</strong></a> might not seem out of place, or in certain activities (biking, motorcycling, jogging, etc.) where this one from <a href="http://www.desantisholster.com/store/SEARCH-BY-HOLSTER-OR-ACCESSORY/GUNNY-SACKS--GUN-CADDIES/Gunny-Sack-Jr/SW/J-36-37-60-317-331-337-360-2-14"><strong>DeSantis</strong></a> could work. They also could help during vacations and weekend  excursions where often a shoulder bag or backpack is too big, but where a  waistpack from a firm like <a href="https://www.tuffproducts.com/product.php?productid=17517&amp;cat=281&amp;page=1"><strong>Tuff Products</strong></a> might fit right in as one drives, walks, sits and stands, while  regularly adjusting their clothing to match repeated changes in the  weather, one&rsquo;s environment and moving back and forth from indoors to  outside.</p><p>If that is the case and a fanny pack works for you, try to find one  that is not only still in vogue (the 90&rsquo;s are over) but that looks as  little like a gun carrier as possible. While I would still suggest using  one that is designed to carry a gun (i.e. one that employs a special  compartment or an internal holster), I would also look at <a href="https://www.tuffproducts.com/product.php?productid=17536&amp;cat=281&amp;page=1"><strong>colors that don&rsquo;t look paramilitary</strong></a> for you do not want to look &ldquo;tactical&rdquo; here. And maybe even go so far  as to decorate the bag with a commercial label or two &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; from  something else that&rsquo;s completely unrelated to firearms.</p><p>Finally, my recommendation that any fanny pack you choose should have a <a href="http://www.unclemikes.com/holsters/belt-pouches/gunrunner-fanny-pack-holsters"><strong>dedicated compartment</strong></a> or an <a href="http://www.desantisholster.com/store/SEARCH-BY-HOLSTER-OR-ACCESSORY/GUNNY-SACKS--GUN-CADDIES/Gunny-Sack/SW/39-53-39-54-69-44-69-46"><strong>internal holster</strong></a> actually applies to everything in this category. Merely tossing a  firearm into a bag of any kind is a mistake. Other loose items can work  their way into the bore of any firearm and they can also get into the  individual chambers of a revolver cylinder. With pistols, bigger objects  and sometimes the linings and interior walls of non-gun-carrying packs,  purses and briefcases can move safety levers out of position and  depress buttons; unintentionally releasing magazines. Carried loosely,  any gun can move out of position (or become blocked by other things) so  that a proper grip cannot be made as part of the drawing process. And  carried with other things, the trigger of any firearm can be left  exposed to inadvertent contact with them.</p><p>One of the better options I&rsquo;ve seen in regard to containing and  protecting a firearm within a non-gun-dedicated, commercial pack, purse  or bag (or even one with a gun compartment), is a just-announced product  from Galco. &ldquo;<a href="http://www.usgalco.com/HolsterP3.asp?ProductID=4436&amp;CatalogID=149"><strong>Carrysafe</strong></a>&rdquo;  is an elasticized nylon, thumb-break holster that will retain the gun  and position it for the draw as well. The holster, attached to a stiff  leather backing plate, is infinitely adjustable for carry angle and the  plate itself allows for a further-adjustable attachment to the bag&rsquo;s  interior if desired.</p><p>Not only should any bag successfully conceal the firearm but it  should also protect it, carry it safely and present it to you in such a  manner that it can be drawn cleanly and efficiently under the stress of a  deadly force engagement.</p><p>As such, purses present even greater issues. Not only do all of the  containment concerns apply, but as they are more visible and carried in a  variety of ways, there are matters of style as well performance to  consider. In the past, gun-carrying purses often looked just like what  they were. And with such little thought given to fashion or design,  they, like fanny packs, all but announced to the world that a gun could  be found inside. Other purses that didn&rsquo;t go that route, often stood out  because they were not in sync with the times or with the overall look  of those women who could have put them to good use. But today, firms  like <a href="http://www.usgalco.com/HolsterP2.asp?CatalogID=149"><strong>Galco</strong></a> on the high end (making all but outright designer knockoffs) and <a href="https://www.guntotenmamas.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?search=action&amp;searchstart=0&amp;sortkey=order&amp;sortorder=descending"><strong>Gun Tote'n Mamas</strong></a> or <a href="http://www.designerconcealedcarry.com/"><strong>Woolstenhulme</strong></a> in the middle (both with a wide range of designs for a variety of needs  and activities) make bags that you won&rsquo;t be ashamed to be seen with and  that contain many of the features thought to be beneficial in such a  device.</p><p>Still, how purses are worn or carried and how the gun is drawn from  them must be looked at closely. Obviously, the gun should not be visible  to others; either through its sidewalls or when the bag is opened for  any reason. Yet the gun must also be reachable in ways that will not  delay access to it during the draw. Magnetic closures or properly  engineered hook-and-loop seals often outshine zippers, which can clog,  break or bind. Additionally, the gun must be carried and drawn in such a  way that the user does not trace any part of their limbs or torso when  it is produced. Far too many designs (and many promotional images of  them) violate this basic tenet of gun safety.</p><p>Even simple things like shoulder straps should be considered. Not  only mustn&rsquo;t they interfere with the production of the firearm but you  need to decide about their construction. Some makers reinforce them with  unseen internal wires or Kevlar-like materials for strength and to  prevent cutting by thieves. A good thought until the idea is thought  through. Perhaps a heightened awareness of one&rsquo;s surroundings and those  who occupy it would be a better counter to purse snatching than  depending on an over-the-shoulder or around-the-arm strap so sturdy that  it might dislocate a shoulder or break an arm rather that give way  under attack.</p><p>Some of this is a bit more complex than it first might seem but all  of it is common sense driven, and none of it should keep you from making  an off-body selection or learning how to protect the gun it contains.  It&rsquo;s just that with this type of carrier, there are some additional  considerations above-and-beyond the usual thoughts given to the more  traditional body-borne holster.</p><p><strong>Out of Sight But Never Out of Mind</strong> Just as I believe fanny packs have long been pass&eacute; for most traditional applications, I am also firmly convinced that various <a href="https://www.guntotenmamas.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&amp;key=GTM0012"><strong>shoulder bags</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.maxpedition.com/store/pc/NOATAK-GEARSLINGER-12p1436.htm"><strong>backpacks</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.blackhawk.com/product/Covert-Carry-Messenger-Bag,1185,1394.htm"><strong>&ldquo;urban&rdquo; carrying devices</strong></a> are still only now coming into their own when it comes to &ldquo;Off Body&rdquo; gun possession.</p><p>Other than their sometimes &ldquo;militaristic&rdquo; appearance (although here  that could be made to work as a fashion statement of sorts at times), I  really like some of the things that <a href="http://www.maxpedition.com/store/pc/Versipacks-c4.htm"><strong>Maxpedition</strong></a> has done in this area and that others like <a href="https://www.tuffproducts.com/product.php?productid=17580&amp;cat=281&amp;page=1"><strong>Tuff Products</strong></a>, and <a href="https://www.guntotenmamas.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&amp;key=GTM0189"><strong>Gun Tote&rsquo;n Mamas</strong></a> are doing as a result of the path they blazed. Shoulder bags like this one from <a href="http://www.designerconcealedcarry.com/cgi-bin/waa1gate.isa?WAA_PACKAGE=BDS&amp;WAA_FORM=LIST_BDSLISTINGS&amp;TS=194178294&amp;U=%7C%7E%7C&amp;C=0000000004MV&amp;p1=00000000A5Y4&amp;p2="><strong>Woolstenhulme</strong></a> that don&rsquo;t look like you just shipped back home from some foreign war  zone, but that still have a readily accessible gun compartment are often  the kind of thing that passers-by never give a second look. Just make  sure that you can reach the gun while you&rsquo;ve got it on.</p><p>But like the purses and fanny packs, you also need to make sure that  you can safely produce the gun. Most important in this respect is that  the muzzle never traces any part of your body. And while most people  rightfully believe that this includes the crossing of one&rsquo;s hands and  torso while the firearm is being brought to bear upon the threat, it  also relates to the positioning of the firearm while it&rsquo;s being carried  so that you grab the grip and not some other part of the weapon when the  draw is first begun. Therefore, while a gun compartment is a good idea,  an internal holster is better.</p><p>Large portfolios and <a href="https://www.guntotenmamas.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&amp;key=GTM0155"><strong>briefcases</strong></a> are another case in point.</p><p>Simply tossing a firearm loosely into a briefcase creates all of the  same problems previously mentioned. Loose items carried in the bag can  work their way into the bore of any firearm and into the open chambers  of a revolver. With pistols, safety levers can be moved out of position  and magazines can be released. The draw can be affected for the same  reasons, as any gun can move out of position or become blocked by other  carried items so that a proper grip cannot be made as part of the  drawing process. However, the biggest issue regarding an unprotected  firearm floating around inside a briefcase is that the trigger can be  exposed to inadvertent contact with anything else inside the bag.</p><p>While the Galco &ldquo;<a href="http://www.usgalco.com/HolsterP3.asp?ProductID=4436&amp;CatalogID=149"><strong>Carrysafe</strong></a>&rdquo;  is an ideal solution to protect a firearm carried in a  non-gun-dedicated, commercial pack, purse or bag (or even one with a gun  compartment), BLACKHAWK! accomplishes much of the same thing with its <a href="http://www.blackhawk.com/product/Diversion-Adjustable-Hook-Back-Holster,1845,1577.htm"><strong>Adjustable Hook Back Holster</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Not only is it compatible with the &ldquo;loop&rdquo; covered linings and dividers  in their bags, but also with some of those found on competitor and even  non-gun-dedicated off-body-carrying packs, pouches and cases.</p><p>That said, there are some excellent compartmentalized briefcases from companies like <a href="http://www.blackhawk.com/product/Advanced-Tactical-Briefcase,135,1394.htm"><strong>BLACKHAWK!</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.unclemikes.com/bags-cases/utility-bags/briefcase-with-hidden-holster"><strong>Uncle Mikes</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.designerconcealedcarry.com/cgi-bin/waa1gate.isa?WAA_PACKAGE=BDS&amp;WAA_FORM=LIST_BDSLISTINGS&amp;TS=194253690&amp;U=%7C%7E%7C&amp;C=0000000004MV&amp;p1=00000000A5Y5&amp;p2="><strong>Woolstenhulme</strong></a>, and <a href="http://www.theconcealmentshop.com/Attache.php"><strong>The Concealment Shop</strong></a> that easily blend in with most any environment and give no clue that  there is a gun inside. They not only keep the gun properly positioned  for a ready draw from within an unseen location (even as you go in and  out of the bag) but they carry the pistol or revolver safely at the same  time. Just make sure that you don&rsquo;t overfill the bag to the point where  either it becomes too clumsy to utilize (a problem with some purses and  fanny packs too), or that it weighs so much that you are tempted to  leave it behind. The whole idea here, after going through all the effort  to obtain a concealed weapons permit, is to have the weapon with you  and not sitting on your desk while you go out to lunch or off to a  meeting.</p><p>These days, with all of the calendar and planner functions available  on our phones and easily carried computer pads and tablets, we are  seeing fewer and fewer people carry the kinds of notebooks and  schedulers that were everywhere just a few years ago. However, if such  things are still common in your world, firms like <a href="http://www.unclemikes.com/holsters/belt-pouches/small-notebook-holster"><strong>Uncle Mike&rsquo;s</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.blackhawk.com/product/Day-Planner-Holster,1814,34.htm"><strong>BLACKHAWK</strong></a><strong>!</strong> make different ones that resemble planners and <a href="http://www.usgalco.com/HolsterPG3.asp?ProductID=2769&amp;GunID=55"><strong>Galco</strong></a> makes one that actually is fully functional in that role. All of them  allow you to bring a firearm along unnoticed to places where you can&rsquo;t  &ldquo;wear&rdquo; it but you still might need it.</p><p>There is some overlapping of those smaller diaries with the still  generally unnoticed, divided pouches that are made by just about  everybody these days but that were initiated by Uncle Mike&rsquo;s almost 20  years ago. Their <a href="http://www.unclemikes.com/holsters/belt-pouches/gun-pak-belt-pouch"><strong>GunPak</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.blackhawk.com/product/Belt-Pouch-Holster,781,34.htm"><strong>BLACKHAWK!&rsquo;s Belt Pouch</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.desantisholster.com/store/SEARCH-BY-HOLSTER-OR-ACCESSORY/GUNNY-SACKS--GUN-CADDIES/The-Gun-Caddie/Ruger/SP101-2-14"><strong>DeSantis&rsquo; Gun Caddie</strong></a>,  and others can be carried in the hand or worn on the belt in ways that  fanny packs never could and they allow the wearer to carry a firearm  with them just about everywhere they go; even allowing the user to reach  inside them without revealing the handgun.</p><p>Some of these pouch-like devices are simply amazing at allowing you  to carry a firearm undetected in all kinds of situations and  environments. But that brings us full circle in regard to the subject of  additional considerations with these designs as to what you do when the  gun is still in any of these Off Body devices we have been discussing  but they are not with you.</p><p>All of the items mentioned can inadvertently promote carelessness or a  lax attitude in regard to the securing of the weapon when it is out of  your immediate control, and that is something that can creep up on even  the most safety-minded individual. While the laws in many states and  municipalities require that unattended firearms be formally secured and  both common sense and our own individual sense of responsibility (and of  right and wrong) are sure to lead us in the same direction, these  non-traditional carriers can instead, lead us astray and perhaps make us  less diligent about such matters than we should be.</p><p>When we come into our homes or maybe enter our workplace, it is very  common to remove a body-borne handgun (or maybe handgun and holster  combination) and lock it up in a safe, cabinet or desk drawer. Because  of how it is carried, we are reminded that it is a firearm and it must  be respected, handled safely and secured when not in use. But a purse  (with the gun unseen inside) can be hung over the back of a chair. A  waist pack, not looking like a gun, can be tossed on to a bed or a table  as those packs not used to transport firearms have always been tossed  aside. A briefcase, made specifically to not look like a gun carrier,  can be abandoned alongside a desk. And a calendar or notebook, designed  to fool everyone as to its true nature, can be set on top of a desk,  table or cabinet and forgotten. Worse yet, many such things can be  inadvertently left behind altogether in restrooms, restaurants, cars,  and cabs because they are not attached to us the way &ldquo;holsters&rdquo; are.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t let this dissuade you from choosing any of these items if they  can be helpful to you in defending your life, but always consider the  big picture in making any decisions as serious as these.</p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Ruger 10/22 Threaded Barrel Takedown]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p><em>7/9/2013</em><br /></p><p>With nearly half a century of shooting history behind it, Ruger's 10/22 blowback-operated semi-auto rimfire rifle is arguably one of the most commercially successful firearms in modern American history. It&rsquo;s a gun that is reasonably priced, compact, ruggedly reliable and accurate with a wide variety of .22 Long Rifle ammunition. In fact, the 10/22 is so popular it has spawned its own <a title="Learn more about accessories for the 10/22. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/GalleryItem.aspx?cid=22&amp;gid=211&amp;id=1903" target="_blank">market</a> for accessories, upgrades and magazines.</p><p>But no matter how spiffy a rifle might be, customers always seem to want something more. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if this handy little carbine could break into two parts so it could be stowed or carried in a much smaller space? In 2012, <a href="http://www.ruger.com/index.html" target="_blank">Ruger</a> introduced the <a title="See video on the Ruger 10/22 Takedown. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/videos/ruger-10-22-take-down/" target="_blank">10/22 Takedown</a> model with a synthetic stock to fill this customer request. </p><p>But even when a gun company releases a revolutionary change in an already popular product, some shooters will look it over and want just one more feature. &ldquo;Wouldn't it be even better if Ruger's Takedown rifle had a threaded muzzle for accessories like flash hiders and <a title="Learn more about suppressors. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/sound-suppressors-101/" target="_blank">sound suppressors</a>?&rdquo; This year Ruger answered this just-a-little-more request with the Model 10/22-TDT, featuring a blued-steel threaded barrel. </p><p>This version of the 10/22 arrives with the same profile features as other synthetic-stock 10/22s. The stock shape, sights and controls are all familiar. One of the nice touches with this gun is the inclusion of a 25-round BX-25 magazine instead of the traditional 10-round version. The two primary differences in this model are found at the end of the barrel and in the forearm of the stock. </p><p>The 16-inch threaded barrel is fitted with a flash hider that looks like the same one found on the <a title="Read the full review on the SR-556 rifle. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/ruger-sr-556-review/" target="_blank">SR-556 .223 rifle</a>. The barrel and forearm separate from the receiver and shoulder stock using a takedown lever located just in front of the magazine well. To break the rifle apart for storage, remove the magazine and lock the bolt in the open position. Then, press and hold the takedown lever, twist the barrel counterclockwise and pull it free of the receiver. The rifle is reassembled in reverse order. Just in case this seems like a confusing process, Ruger places a large sticker with instructions on the stock. </p><p>The 10/22 TDT arrives from the factory separated. So in addition to the usual inspection and lubrication one usually performs for factory-fresh guns, this rifle requires a little tuning before the first trip to the range. Once the barrel is installed, tighten the connection using the knurled adjustment ring in front of the receiver until it is finger tight. Then, remove the barrel and give it one or two more clicks. When the barrel is re-installed, it should feel nice and snug. Each time the rifle is separated and reassembled, the bolt should be manually cycled a few times against the empty chamber to help reseat the barrel. If over the course of shooting, it starts to have feeding or accuracy issues, double check the barrel tightness. It won't need adjusting often, but is something of which to be aware. </p><p>Ruger goes the extra mile by providing a well-designed custom carry case for 10/22-TDT. One side of the interior features two narrow pockets to hold the two halves of the gun. On the other side is a roomy single pocket to hold ammo, optics, cleaning supplies or whatever else can fit. The lower exterior pocket features pouches for 25-round magazines, and the upper pocket is padded so it can be used as a pistol case. The included shoulder strap allows the case to be carried over the shoulder or worn like a day pack. All in all, the case completes the whole takedown concept by allowing the rifle to be easily stored and transported without an obvious long-gun profile. </p><p>Of course, the 10/22 in any configuration begs to be accessorized, so the time at the shooting range was enhanced with a few useful add-ons. This rifle arrives with a scope mount. However, in order to take advantage of both an optic and the iron sights at the same time, an <a href="http://www.ncstar.com/" target="_blank">NcStar</a> model MRUHB1022 see-through scope base with matching quick-release rings was used to mount an <a href="http://www.alpenoptics.com/" target="_blank">Alpen Optics&rsquo;</a> Kodiak 3-9x32 Wide Angle riflescope. The value-priced Kodiak provided a wide, clear sight picture that was more comfortable to look through for extended shooting sessions than some of the .22-specific scopes on the market. </p><p>New for this year, Ruger and <a href="http://www.lasermax.com/" target="_blank">Lasermax</a> have teamed up to produce a laser sight for 10/22 rifles fitted with factory-style stocks. The fiberglass-reinforced nylon laser housing replaces the factory barrel band and is contoured to look like a natural extension of the forearm. The bright 635-nanometer red laser is pre-aligned at the factory for use at 25 yards, but it can be adjusted for longer distances. Two 2-inch Picatinny rail mounts allow additional accessories to be attached. This sight system is available exclusively from Ruger.</p><p>Informal target shooting out to 25 yards was just as enjoyable with the 10/22-TDT as with other versions of this rifle. Any concerns about the Takedown's ability to feed different brands of .22 Long Rifle ammunition were allayed by its reliable function with a variety of loads using a mix of factory and aftermarket magazines. No soda can, steel plate or dirt clod was safe with the Lasermax sight to enhance aiming with the iron sights. As always, the light weight and low recoil of this rifle made for a long, enjoyable shooting session both on and off the bench. </p><p>Formal accuracy testing was conducted with the rifle scoped and set into a benchrest using targets posted at 50 yards. Although the factory trigger was a little heavy, requiring 5-pounds, 8-ounces of pull to cycle, it had a short, crisp break that supported solid accuracy. Groups ranged from 1.25 inches to 2 inches in size, depending on the ammunition used. Not bad at all for an out-of-the-box .22 carbine. </p><p>The 10/22-TDT Takedown represents a real innovation in the evolution of this shooting platform. Instead of another color option or different barrel length, Ruger's designers have made it possible for the 10/22 to boldly fit where it's never been stored before. And they did it while preserving the shootability, reliability and reasonable price that have made the 10/22 platform an American mainstay at the range. </p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co.

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Tattoo artist Sean Rodriguez was working one afternoon when he was alerted to an assault taking place outside Black Cobra Tattoo. Six men could be seen assaulting an individual in the parking lot. "I couldn't just sit back and watch an innocent person being hurt,…" said Rodriguez. He grabbed the firearm he is licensed to carry and approached the group of men. Upon seeing the gun, the suspects fled. Rodriguez never fired a shot, nor did he point the gun in their direction. "That was just an incident of a responsible gun owner doing what they're supposed to do," Rodriguez explained. The victim was treated for minor injuries and nothing was stolen. It was last reported that all six suspects are still at large. (<a href="http://www.delmarvanow.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Daily Times</em></a>, Salisbury, MD, 3/21/13)</p><p>A hatchet-wielding intruder broke into an Indiana man's home on Monday morning. The homeowner was asleep when Jason Rabe, 23, shattered a window and entered the rear of the home. According to the LaPort County Sheriff's Dept., Rabe rode a moped to the house with the intent to break in. When the homeowner awoke to the breaking glass he grabbed his pistol and began to canvass his home, stumbling upon Rave who was carrying a hatchet. Words were exchanged and a fight broke out, during which the homeowner fatally wounded Rabe. The homeowner suffered some cuts and bruises, but declined medical treatment.

Only one of the two darts fired from the device connected, and an enraged Kerensky pulled out his conventional pistol and fired three times in the air, sending the man fleeing. The stun gun delivers a shock of 50,000 volts, but only if both darts strike the intended victim. (<em>The Evening Bulletin</em>, Philadelphia, PA) </p>]]></bodyContent>

" href="https://www.facebook.com/AmericanRifleman" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, I do occasionally log on to keep up with family and friends. I&rsquo;ve also discovered that a lot of useful tips get passed on through social media, including this one for finding a lost child when at a major public event. </p><p>Next time you&rsquo;re at an amusement park, fireworks spectacular, parade or other event where kids can easily separate from parents, write your cell phone number on the child&rsquo;s arm and cover it with liquid bandage. This provides an easy way for authorities to get in touch to let you know that your child is safe and where he or she can be found. </p><p>This can also be done with a bracelet or necklace, or the tactics can be combined to ensure that your child can be identified after wandering away. If you have additional tips for keeping track of your kids, share them in the comments and the best get a mention in a later post. <br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><p>I travel a great deal on the open highways of the western states. As a retired Peace Officer, I have the required permits to make it perfectly legal to carry a gun while I do this. You will never get me to condone carrying guns when it is in any way illegal. There are many laws that are nonsensical, but I have a citizen&rsquo;s duty to obey them&mdash;and exercise the citizen&rsquo;s right to vote to change them. At the outset of this discussion, please understand that when the laws of your state do not allow carrying as a motorist, the rest of what I have to say is moot.</p><p>So what is an ideal list of characteristics for a gun that stays in the car (or, in my case, truck)? Usually, the threat to a motorist is carjacking, which is probably most common in our major cities. Latter-day highwaymen sometimes stop cars in order to rob the occupants of money, jewelry or other valuables or steal the car. Guns are their favorite tools to accomplish this and, in my book, that means they qualify for armed response. </p><p>Like most criminal attacks, a carjacking is likely to be very sudden and unexpected. To defense such an onslaught, you have to respond with instantaneous, overwhelming force. If you are interested in making preparations for this eventuality, I would suggest you consider Clint Smith&rsquo;s Vehicle Defense course at <a href="http://www.thunderranchinc.com/" target="_blank">Thunder Ranch</a>. In a week, he will make you aware of the tactics and techniques of fighting from behind the steering wheel of your own car. The question is with what?</p><p>Almost any decent handgun in a properly powerful caliber will do, but my experience at Thunder Ranch caused me to re-think my position on armament. Even inside the spacious cab of a big GMC, your movements are somewhat restricted. For that reason, I would not choose a really big handgun. A longer firearm might get all tangled up in seat belts, etc. Short and powerful is a good way to go. And because you might be forced to shoot with the gun all cockeyed in your hand, it seems to me that a revolver, which is not sensitive to limp wristing, is a better way to go. That&rsquo;s an opinion.<br /></p></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Smith & Wesson K-32]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Over the many years that <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CustomContentDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=750001&amp;catalogId=750051&amp;content=11001" target="_blank">Smith &amp; Wesson</a> has been making revolvers, they’ve produced literally hundreds of different models and thousands of variations of those models. Some, like the timeless M&amp;P revolver in .38 S&amp;W Spl., have been in continuous production for decades. Others die quick deaths, because if they don’t sell, they don’t last. The revolver with which I am concerned here is the K frame .32 S&amp;W Long, which was assigned Model No. 16 when they started numbering in 1957. Made from the late 1940s to the mid-70s, the K32 had a very interesting background.</p><p>It came along when S&amp;W was booming in the post-war gun market. Actually, the sleek K frame was part of a trio of guns the company called the Masterpiece models. Others in the well-advertised series were the K22 and K38. They were K frame, blue-steel, 6-inch barreled revolvers intended for bullseye competition. S&amp;W actually went to the trouble to match the weight of the three models by changing the barrel profile. Competitive shooters of that day were often users of the revolver, so a matched set of three guns sounded rather appealing. They could use either the K32 or K38 for the “any centerfire” events and the K22 for the .22 rimfire. Shooters had to use a .45 for the other third of the 2,700 course and yep, Smith made a couple of.45 ACP revolvers. The size of the .45 cartridge mandated an N frame, so the matched-in-weight concept couldn’t be made to work here.</p><p>In practice, most shooters chose a K22 and a K38, then a match-conditioned M1911A1 or a Colt Gold Cup. When the company began to make Model 41 autos, shooters flocked to them and the K22s began to be rare birds on the Bullseye firing lines. The K38s lasted pretty well, simply because it was hard to make the .38 Spl. cartridge feed in an auto. I have never seen much in the way of evidence to justify the existence of the K32. They sold well enough to stay in the catalog for quite a while, but were eventually discontinued. They are very valuable because of their scarcity and a brand new Model 16 next to a brand new Model 14 (K38) of the same vintage will invariably command a greater price. In theory, the K32 should have been a better choice for a competitive shooter, because of the reduced recoil. I believe that it failed because of the performance of the smaller wadcutter bullet at 50 yards.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://home.nra.org/" target="_blank">NRA</a> Publications is comprised of a group of people whose business is writing about firearms and shooting, thus there are a lot of discussions in the office on guns, tactics, ammunition and training. Often those discussions lead to very interesting ideas.</p><p>Recently, I was talking with our armorer about conducting malfunction drills without a training partner. The problem is that if you set up the malfunction, then you know when and how to conduct the drill, which eliminates the surprise factor. I’ve conducted malfunction drills by having a partner implement either a stove pipe or double feed and handing me the gun, and while this provides a level of surprise, it doesn’t allow the gun to go down in a middle of a shooting string. One way to implement that situation is by loading magazine with dummy rounds or empty brass.</p><p>For this drill you need three to four magazines, some ammunition in your caliber and a few dummy rounds or pieces of empty brass. Have a partner load the magazines, slipping in a “bad round” or two in an unknown location in each magazine. You can also load the magazines yourself, but be sure to randomly load the dummy rounds and the magazines to prevent prior knowledge of the pending event. Then simply run the magazines empty, clearing any malfunctions along the way.</p><p>Firearms are mechanical tools that can malfunction, and since things always seem to go wrong at the worst possible time, it’s prudent to know how to clear a gun quickly and efficiently. And realistic practice makes one better prepared.</p>]]></bodyContent>

This is a huge breakthrough for people serious about their personal safety."</p><p>The Reactor 5 features a two-color state of charge indicator and Viridian’s Enhanced Combat Readiness to activate the laser during the draw without buttons, sliders or grips. Every Reactor 5 comes with a Viridian ECR equipped pocket holster. To arm, simply turn on the laser before holsters. The laser turns on in the holster, but activates upon the draw.</p><p>The Reactor 5 for the Ruger LCP is the first of the Reactor models.

              <title><![CDATA[Break-In]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>I’ve only had short catnaps since early Saturday morning when an attempted break-in occurred. The alleged perp’s already out on bail, sleeping less than 300 yards away. The district attorney refused to see me before the initial hearing, my wife and I wasted an entire day in a futile attempt at getting a restraining order and last night it was the rumbling of an aging ceiling fan that convinced me someone was in the driveway.</p><p>My poor initial decision is what’s really giving me nightmares. I know better, thanks to the number of tactical and self-defense courses I’ve attended. I have no doubt, however, that it was the practice and muscle memory I gained in those classes that kept me out of harm’s way once law enforcement arrived.</p><p>It all started with a trip to the bathroom at around midnight and a side trip to the fridge. That’s when I heard the smashing and saw someone using my own rake to break through a sliding-glass door into the converted garage (Lesson 1: put away all your tools, even if you’re not done with the leaves). It was locked, alarmed and the din of our floodlamps on the perp was blinding. The alarm was not sounding.</p><p>I screamed at least three times that I had called the police. “Daniel, open up the door,” was the response. Now there are two? I turned on all the lights in the garage, but the attempted break-in continued.</p><p>The rest of the incident is a blur with a few exceptions. I had an unloaded AR-15 in a photo setup covered in the locked garage, so I opened the door, grabbed the gun, and moved as fast as I could to point it through what glass remained. The person was staring directly at the business end of the flash hider and didn’t blink. I resorted to salty language and declared my intentions of using it. Nothing. Blank stare. No one was home. I worked the charging handle. So much for that old fable. She went back to work on the door while screaming for Daniel.</p><p>Sometime during the mess my wife dialed 9-1-1, but before she could back me up with her loaded <a href="http://www.ruger.com/index.html" target="_blank">Ruger</a> LCR, I was out the door and things were up-close-and-personal. The alleged burglar ran off, dropping the rake, car keys and a hemostat within about 20 yards.</p><p>By this time my wife handed me my loaded <a href="Wilson Combat" target="_blank">Wilson Combat</a> CQB Elite that I should have grabbed in the first place. That’s what’s giving me nightmares (Lesson 2: Never take an unloaded gun to a gunfight). I then cleared the rest of the garage, and there’s a lot of pie to slice in there with two storage rooms.</p><p>As I saw the squad car pulling up, my handgun was placed on the bumper of our truck in the driveway and I immediately declared its presence (Lesson 3: Instructors tell you to practice seemingly trivial stuff like that because you’ll be on auto-pilot if the unthinkable happens….I know). That, apparently, allowed the officer to take off in pursuit.</p><p>A pair of officers caught her, covered in blood, around 15 minutes later. A fall on the gravel or the thick woods behind the house apparently took their toll.</p><p>It wasn’t until the next day that I learned my wife was not on the phone with 9-1-1 the entire time (Lesson 4: Your pleas for the bad guy to leave before you use the gun need to be recorded, so stay on the line with 9-1-1 and, if like in this case, you somehow get disconnected, call back).</p><p>The only authorities discussing our proximity concerns are the awesome deputies who responded (Lesson 5: These guys have a dangerous and thankless job, keep that in mind and if you do wield a firearm to thwart an attack, declare it immediately upon police arrival and obey their instructions implicitly and instantly).</p><p>After more than a dozen years of search-and-rescue work hauling broken bodies out of the wilderness, the last thing I want to do is be forced to take someone’s life-so I’m thankful no shots were fired. Total damages came in at $2,400.</p><p>Judging by the blank stare and inability to answer basic questions, law enforcement is confident Daniel is imaginary. We’re not letting our guard down, though, so the cartridges in our guns are not.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[A Classic Returns in .257 Bob]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>The 1920s were a fascinating time in American history. Full of pride and bravado after saving the world from the Kaiser, Americans led the way in the industrial revolution, as well as a cultural upheaval. Shooters were caught up in the mix, too, with gunnies everywhere experimenting with new cartridge designs. One popular experimenter and writer of the day was Ned H. Roberts. He, as well as some other experimenters, was consumed with the idea of what were called “quarter-bore cartridges,” cartridges of .25 caliber. The idea was to have one rifle capable of being shot all day at varmints, yet have enough power and range to take deer-sized game. Roberts-after much experimentation-settled on the 7x57 Mauser as a parent case for his quarter-bore brainchild.</p><p>Custom rifles from Niedner and Griffin &amp; Howe became available for Roberts’ wildcat in 1928 and were quite popular among hunters. In 1934, <a href="http://www.remington.com/" target="_blank">Remington</a> brought the cartridge into its factory fold changing Roberts original 15-degree shoulder angle back to the parent’s 20-degree angle, naming the former wildcat the .257 Remington Roberts and chambering the company’s Model 30 bolt-action rifle for it. Winchester immediately chambered its Model 54 for the cartridge, and when it came out with the Model 70 in 1936, the .257 Roberts-as it became known-was one of the original chamberings. With the exception of World War II when all armories were supporting the war effort, the .257 Bob-a common nickname it received-was somewhat popular.</p><p>However, by the mid-’50s the 6 mm cartridges began to show up, casting a bit of a shadow over Ned Roberts’ cartridge. A big part of this was due to the fact that Remington kept the factory loads pretty mild in deference to some older receivers that weren’t up to modern pressures. Factory loads replicated the ballistics of the .250 Savage. Handloaders were able to get all the capabilities of the .257 Bob, provided the rifles they shot were strong like the Remington and Winchester. Too, part of riding the wave of a fad is the inevitable slide off the crest due to boredom. Fad shooters are just like fad anything; they are in a perpetual search for something new to stimulate their minds. Eventually the gun manufacturers quietly dropped the .257 Roberts from their chambering menu, replacing it with the 6 mm Remington and .243 Winchester. Because so many rifles were out there chambered for the Roberts’ cartridge, ammo makers continue to make occasional runs.</p><p>Winchester discontinued chambering the Model 70 in .257 Roberts in 1959. In the mid-1980s Winchester Ammunition began offering +P loads in the .257 Roberts at 5 percent to 7 percent above the Remington factory load and featured a 117-grain Power-Point at 2,780 fps from a 24-inch test barrel. Browning/USRAC also did a limited run of the Model 70 XTR in .257 Roberts. This Model 70, along with most rifles chambered for the .257 Bob, are made with 22-inch barrels.</p><p>Recently, the renewed Winchester Repeating Arms Company made a special run of 500 Model 70s in .257 Bob for <a href="http://www.cabelas.com/" target="_blank">Cabela’s</a>. I saw it at this year’s Media Day at the <a title="See what else came out at SHOT." href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blog_list.php?cat_id=43" target="_blank">SHOT Show</a>, but the frigid gale blowing that day made shooting this new chambering futile. I’ve always had a bit of a soft spot for the .257 Bob, believing the heavier 117- and 120-grain bullets to be a good performer on lighter game like deer and antelope. Cabela’s Joe Arterburn knows I am a sucker for Model 70s, so he sent me one to evaluate.</p><p>The Cabela’s rendition of this chambering is thoughtfully done in the Featherweight platform-it features a 22-inch barrel tapered to a Featherweight profile to reduce weight. The stock is A-grade fancy walnut, checkered to 20 lpi. Because this is a premium rifle, the bolt is jeweled, and the entire rifle is polished to a deep luster-both wood and metal. It is equipped with Winchester’s MOA trigger that some like and others disdain for its departure from the original design. At a bare weight of 7 pounds, it qualifies as a Featherweight in terms of Winchester Featherweight nomenclature, though lighter rifles are made today. My test sample came with a Cabela’s 3x9 scope already on it, swelling the rifle’s weight to 8 pounds, 9 ounces.</p><p>The wet, cold and downright nasty spring weather we have been enjoying postponed my range time with the new Model 70 a couple of weeks. Once there though, the rifle didn’t disappoint. My first shots using Remington Express with a 117-grain Core-Lokt bullet loaded to the same mildness Remington has always loaded this cartridge fell into a 1 3/8-inch group. Ten rounds later, my chronograph confirmed the mildness of this load showing an average velocity of 2,565 fps. Completing the test with the Remington load yielded an average group size of 1 1/8 inches.</p><p>I then switched to some semi-custom ammo from <a href="http://thehuntingshack.com/" target="_blank">The Hunting Shack</a>, out of Stevensville, Mont. Under the trade name of HSM, this ammunition is loaded with premium bullets and often powders that are not available to most handloaders. In this case, the .257 Roberts cartridges were loaded with Berger 115-grain HPBT Hunting VLD bullets. Though this was my first experience with .25-caliber Bergers, I have loaded and now regularly use the 130-grain HPBT Hubting VLD bullet in my .270 Winchesters, and they are superb in terms of accuracy and terminal performance on game. Loaded to a much zippier 2,973 fps average, this ammo was clearly the front runner with groups averaging 7/8 inch.</p><p>Several things come to mind as I ponder this rifle. First, I wish it was available 35 or 40 years ago when I did a lot of backpack hunting. Its light weight and mild recoil make it an excellent choice for the mountain hunter. Secondly, in its modern loadings or handloads, the .257 Roberts has a better downrange trajectory and hits harder than the .243 Win. or 6 mm Rem. And finally, you younger hunters take some advice from an old man that knows better now: By the time you reach my age this rifle will probably have acquired another generation of dedicated aficionados and be worth more than you paid for it.</p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Winchester Model 70 Limited Edition: <a href="http://www.cabelas.com/" target="_blank">www.cabelas.com</a></p><p><strong>Type:</strong> Bolt action</p><p><strong>Caliber:</strong> .257 Roberts</p><p><strong>Barrel Length:</strong> 22”</p><p><strong>Magazine/Capacity:</strong> Integral box/five-round capacity</p><p><strong>Trigger:</strong> 4 lbs., 1 oz.</p><p><strong>Rifling:</strong> 1:10” RH</p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> None; drilled and tapped for scope base</p><p><strong>Safety:</strong> Three-position crossbolt</p><p><strong>Stock:</strong> A-grade walnut</p><p><strong>Drop at comb/heel:</strong> 1/2 inch; 5/8 inch</p><p><strong>Overall Length:</strong> 43 3/4 inches</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 7 lbs.</p><p><strong>Metal Finish:</strong> Blue</p><p><strong>Suggested Retail Price:</strong> $1,700</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/257RobertsShootingResults1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-23074" title="257RobertsShootingResults" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/257RobertsShootingResults1.jpg" alt="" width="644" height="312" /></a></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Packing the Remington R1 Carry 1911 .45 Pistol]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.remington.com/" target="_blank">Remington</a> recently released the latest version of its popular<a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blog.php?id=15317&amp;cat=45" target="_blank"> R1 1911 pistol series</a>, simply named the <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blog.php?id=15236&amp;cat=43" target="_blank">R1 Carry</a>. With the current trends in concealed handgun design leaning toward easy-to-pack models, one might have expected this .45 to be a cut down, aluminum-framed compact with the grip heel rounded off and lasers installed in the grip. Instead, the R1 Carry is a steel-frame, full-size 1911 that has been especially configured for concealed carry. Considering the current gun market, one might wonder why Remington's chose to go this route.</p><p>Now appearing to question the usefulness of a 1911 pistol for self-defense, in any configuration, risks the wrath of a whole bunch of shooters out there. For many, all good pistols start and end with the number 1911. But before breaking out the tar and feathers, just hear me out on this.</p><p>Not all shooters are dyed-in-the-wool 1911 fans. First, the grip shape and control placement are not always a good fit for certain hand types and sizes, thus shooters with smaller hands or shorter fingers may choose other designs. Second, good 1911s are not exactly cheap, though perfectly adequate non-1911 options are available for less money. Finally, the shooting market is currently flooded with a wide variety of small, reliable, lightweight defensive semi-autos and revolvers. Does a relatively large and heavy steel 1911 pistol still make sense for daily carry?</p><p>In its favor, the R1 Carry made a great first impression right out of the box. The forged carbon-steel slide and frame are thoroughly de-horned, removing any sharp edges or corners. The frame, slide and the controls have been expertly treated with a satin-black oxide finish that complements the de-horning work. The sights consist of a dovetailed <a href="http://www.novaksights.com/" target="_blank">Novak</a> LoMount plain black rear sight and a tritium night sight in the front.</p><p>The slide is cut with angled rear cocking serrations and a lowered and flared ejection port. Internally, the pistol reflects Mr. Browning’s original simple and reliable design. The recoil assembly consists of the traditional plunger, short guide rod and single round-wire recoil spring. The 5-inch linked stainless-steel barrel has a target crown and is supported by a stainless-steel barrel bushing.</p><p>The enhanced hammer, of the skeletonized combat variety, is paired with an extended beavertail grip safety fitted with a memory bump. Having the grip safety’s memory bump cut with the same grip-enhancing 25 lines-per-inch (LPI) checkering as the main spring housing and front strap is a nice touch. The thumb safety is ambidextrous with paddles shaped to fit the natural bend of a user’s thumb for increased operator comfort.</p><p>The R1 Carry package is enhanced with a pair of handsome checkered cocobolo grip panels, attached with matte black Torx-head screws. The pistol arrives with two magazines; one is a 7-round flat base version, the other an 8-round model with an extended bumper pad base plate. The machined skeletonized aluminum match trigger, fitted with an over travel screw, tipped the trigger gauge at exactly 5 pounds. In dry fire, the trigger proved to be both crisp and smooth, feeling lighter than the trigger gauge suggested.</p><p>The R1 Carry performed beautifully at the shooting range. The action was tight and buttery smooth. The trigger's short, crisp break made it easy to stay on target. If 1911 pistols feel big and slippery in your hands, checkering on the front strap and main-spring housing can significantly improve the feel of the grip, as it did with the R1. Both of the magazines worked as expected, functioning properly and ejecting briskly when requested.</p><p>For those who haven’t shot a top-quality slab side, the reasons a full-size steel 1911, like the R1 Carry, remain a relevant choice for personal defense become quite clear during a live-fire session. The weight and balance of the 5-inch barrel and steel frame come together with the short, crisp trigger and excellent sights to produce tight target groups while experiencing moderate levels of felt recoil. A really good .45, like the R1 Carry proved to be, has a personality all its own, and folks who use them know they can trust their life to them.</p><p>Fed a diet of .45 ACP rounds ranging from budget ball loads to premium hollow points from companies like<a href="http://store.chencustom.com/" target="_blank"> ASYM</a>, <a href="http://www.doubletapammo.com/php/catalog/index.php" target="_blank">DoubleTap</a> and <a href="http://hprammo.com/" target="_blank">HPR</a>, the R1 Carry produced no malfunctions over the course of testing. Formal bench-rest accuracy testing with premium loads provided group sizes that were better than expected, even from an in-house custom pistol like this one. When an iron-sighted defensive handgun keeps bench-fired groups hovering near the 3 ½-inch mark at 25 yards, then in most cases it’s considered an accurate pistol. The R1 regularly grouped at or under 3 inches, with five group averages ranging from 2.6 to 2.75 inches in size.</p><p>So the R1 Carry is good looking, accurate, reliable and loaded with the features 1911 shooters like to see. But how did it measure up when it came to packing it around all day? If you have never carried a gun in a belt holster, then any rig is going to take time to get used to. However, as with all pistols big and small, the right holster and belt combination will literally make all of the difference in the world.</p><p>For packing the R1 Carry, a <a href="http://www.desantisholster.com/" target="_blank">DeSantis</a> Mad Max inside-the-waistband holster with a matching De Santis belt, worked out nicely. As a small-framed shooter, I don't have much room to conceal large pistols. But using this holster system, the R1 could be completely concealed with a light cover garment, and it did a great job of retaining the pistol while allowing for a smooth draw. It was a bit of a surprise to see how comfortable packing this pistol could be.</p><p>Over the course of this review, the reasons for the 1911's continued popularity as a defensive pistol were reinforced by the performance of Remington's new R1 Carry .45 ACP. With a suggested retail of $1,299, this is not a cheap gun, but the money spent to buy one would be well invested, indeed. It's important to ask yourself exactly how much confidence you have in your defensive handgun. Will it run reliably? Does it have enough stopping power? Does it provide accurate shot placement for critical first and follow-up shots? Many shooters choose to sacrifice some physical comfort for the peace of mind that comes with having a well-made 1911 at hand. If you are in the market for just such a pistol, the R1 Carry deserves your attention.</p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Remington: <a href="http://www.remington.com/" target="_blank">www.remington.com</a></p><p><strong>Model:</strong> 1911 R1 Carry</p><p><strong>Action:</strong> Single action semi-auto</p><p><strong>Caliber:</strong> .45 ACP</p><p><strong>Finish:</strong> Satin black oxide</p><p><strong>Grips:</strong> Checkered Cocobolo</p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> Novak Sights with Tritium Front Night Sight</p><p><strong>Barrel Length:</strong> 5”</p><p><strong>Overall Length:</strong> 8.5”</p><p><strong>Height:</strong> 5.5”</p><p><strong>Width:</strong> 1.34”</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 38.5 ozs.</p><p><strong>Capacity:</strong> (1) 7-Round &amp; (1) 8-Round Magazine with Bumper Pad Provided</p><p><strong>Trigger Pull:</strong> 3.5 to 5 lbs.</p><p><strong>Twist:</strong> 1:16” LH</p><p><strong>Rifle Grooves:</strong> 6</p><p><strong>Accessories</strong>: Lockable Hard Case, Lock, Owner’s Manual, Bushing Wrench</p><p><strong>Suggested Retail Price:</strong> $1,299</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Remington_R1C_Results_s_web1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-23090" title="Remington_R1C_Results_s_web" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Remington_R1C_Results_s_web1.jpg" alt="" width="644" height="418" /></a></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>With only 10 contestants left, Top Shot producers couldn’t help but try and introduce a little bit of drama into the show. They weren’t successful (I’m guessing that this is a great group of shooters who don’t want to bash one another), but they did show that fan-favorite Kelly doesn’t really hang out with the other shooters in the house.</p><p>I don’t care if the people like each other or not. I just want to see some cool shooting activities, which is exactly what was shown in the episode called “Threading the Needle.” First, all of the competitors had to use a Ruger Security Six in .357 Mag. to punch a bullseye target with a single shot. While this isn’t all that difficult in itself, these shooters had to perform this feat after being strapped into a wheel that spun them upside down three times before stopping in a position previously determined by a smaller spin of the wheel. Set up in clock fashion, each shooter had the potential of firing from any position from 1 o’clock to 12 o’clock.</p><p>Still with only one shooter measuring over 2 inches from the bulls, this wasn’t too difficult for the competitors. Chris won a Bass Pro Shop rod and reel with an awesome shot that was only .1 inch from the bullseye, barely edging Kelly who measured .3 inches. Jamie really pulled his shot and the hole 3.5 inches from the bullet’s intended point sent him to the Proving Ground. Gary, Brian and Adam joined him to use a Colt Peacemaker to hit another bullseye target 40 feet away, and for the second time that day Gary made the worst shot of the group.</p><p>Jamie joined Gary in the Elimination Competition, which consisted of firing through seven Plexiglas tubes with ranging diameters that started at 4 inches and ended at 1.5 inches. Though it was a close match, Gary hit his last target before Jamie, who received the dreaded line: “You have fired your last shot.”</p><p>While Jamie didn’t earn the title of History’s Top Shot, once again he competed with class and skill, honoring himself and the United States Navy.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Moving: It Isn't That Simple]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>"Why don't firearm manufacturers in the Northeast simply pick up and move considering all the horrible gun laws passed up there recently?” Such is typical of the letters I have received from many NRA members, particularly in light of oppressive laws passed recently in Connecticut and New York. And it’s a good question.</p><p>Firearm companies are in business for a reason, and that is to generate profit for their owners or investors. Unlike our government, which endlessly borrows money when it spends more than it takes in, when a business spends more than it earns or has on hand (or what banks will lend in promise of future profits), it closes.</p><p>Some companies have made plans to move, for both principle and good business reasons. Kahr Arms will move its headquarters and engineering operations to Pennsylvania, and JLD Enterprises (makers of the H&amp;K-based PTR rifles) is relocating to South Carolina. Magpul has boldly made the commitment to move after Colorado’s legislators rammed an anti-gun-owner law with an arbitrary magazine capacity limit down its constituents’ throats-and the accessory and magazine maker’s prime vendor is going with it. But Magpul does take a risk and an interruption in production to do what its CEO, Richard Fitzpatrick, believes is the right thing for his company, his workers and his consumers.</p><p>Mark Malkowski of Stag Arms in New Britain, Conn., is weighing numerous attractive offers to move to another state. As a matter of fact, while the “American Rifleman Television” crew was recently in his facility shooting a television show (airing Wednesday, Oct. 2), we were scheduled between the visits of Texas Gov. Rick Perry and others trying to recruit Stag and its high-end manufacturing jobs to their local and more politically friendly economies. Stag Arms is a modern facility, with many new machines, and one that can move. Malkowski’s home state’s governor’s office declared the illusory “public safety” benefit of more gun control laws more important than the jobs provided by the lawful firearm makers of Connecticut.</p><p>Other companies that are not as flexible simply cannot move and remain profitable. It’s complicated to pick up and move a large, “heavy” manufacturing operation-and gunmaking is indeed heavy manufacturing. In addition to the need to make sure you have a fully trained workforce in place when you get there, some machines, especially older ones, do not respond well to being moved. I’m not even sure Smith &amp; Wesson <em>could</em> move its century-old forge. Also, some companies have fairly complicated labor agreements in place, and the penalties for moving would be financially damaging, even ruinous, for them.</p><p>It appears that many makers will be limiting or eliminating expansion in their existing locations with onerous gun control laws rather than moving. Ruger, for example, has acquired property in North Carolina, and Colt already has land in Florida. Remington has a huge plant in Kentucky, and Beretta has had a facility in Virginia for some time. O.F. Mossberg &amp; Sons does most of its assembly in Texas already, while its North Haven, Conn., plant concentrates on cutting metal. And Kahr has plans to eventually expand manufacturing into its new Pennsylvania location. Movement may come, but it needs to be done with business sense. And it appears that is the case so far.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[TriStar C-100 9 mm Luger]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.tristararms.com/" target="_blank">TriStar Sporting Arms</a> has built its reputation around the importation of quality Turkish sporting and defensive shotguns offered at reasonable prices. Not long ago the company decided to expand its product line to include a series of semi-automatic pistols built by Canik 55. Canik has a reputation for producing pistol clones that often rival the originals for quality and reliability, but without the sticker shock.</p><p>The TriStar C-100 is a compact double-action/single-action 9 mm pistol based on the famous CZ-75 pistol, originally developed in 1975 by Ceská Zbrojovka Uherský Brod (CZUB) of the Czech Republic. The C-100’s design has also been influenced by the Tanfoglio Witness pistols, which are CZ-75 derivatives.</p><p>The slide is constructed of steel, features rear serrations and is fitted with full-length guide rails. It fits inside of the frame, instead of wrapping over the frame as in the M1911 design. Sights consist of a fixed three-dot night system with a pinned, replaceable front sight and a dovetailed, windage-adjustable rear sight. The dots have been treated with a phosphorescent paint that glows brightly for a few minutes when “charged” with a flashlight.</p><p>Because the frame is made of a lightweight aluminum alloy, the pistol’s overall weight is 24.5 ounces-in line with many of the polymer-frame pistols in the same size class. The generous trigger guard is formed with a flat, serrated finger rest along the front edge. One of the reasons the CZ-75 style pistols have remained popular is because of their comfortable and ergonomically efficient grip shape. The grip frame provides enough room for a full three-finger grip and is fitted with checkered polymer stocks that provide a positive gripping surface. A beavertail extension protects the shooter’s hand from being pinched by the exposed skeletonized hammer even when using a high grip.</p><p>The controls are located on the pistol’s left side, including the slide stop, magazine release and thumb safety. The safety can be engaged with the hammer forward or fully cocked. This gives the user the option of firing the first shot in double-action mode, or carrying the pistol cocked-and-locked like an M1911. The trigger was smooth and heavy (12 pounds) in double-action mode, much like a quality revolver but with a shorter stroke. The single-action pull had about a quarter of an inch of takeup before breaking at 4 pounds, 11 ounces.</p><p>Field stripping the C-100 for cleaning is easy. Start by removing the magazine and verifying that the pistol is unloaded. With the hammer forward, pull the slide back until the disassembly notches on the frame and slide, located on the left side, align. While holding the slide in that position, remove the slide stop. Pull the slide forward and off the frame. Remove the recoil spring assembly, which consists of a steel guide rod and a single braided wire spring, from the slide. Lift the barrel out of the slide and disassembly is complete. Examination of the 3.9-inch barrel showed it to be cut with traditional six-groove rifling, which allows for the use of less-expensive, unjacketed lead bullets.</p><p>The C-100 provided a shooting experience on the test range that exceeded our expectations based on the suggested sales price. It’s not uncommon with value-priced pistols to see or feel the cost savings in the form of a slightly gritty trigger, loose fitting parts or a just-acceptable level of accuracy. The C-100, on the other hand, had none of those problems. The overall fit and finish were excellent, with the frame and slide exhibiting an even matte-black surface free of scratches or machine marks.</p><p>The slide-to-frame fit was properly tight with no discernible looseness. The full-length rails and clean machining made the slide smooth to cycle right out of the box. The thumb safety snapped crisply in and out of engagement, instilling confidence in carrying the pistol with the hammer cocked. The round, serrated magazine release consistently dropped magazines free without being sticky or mushy. The two provided 15-round magazines, made by Mec-Gar of Italy, were sturdy and cleanly constructed.</p><p>The grip shape and low bore axis of the C-100 made for comfortable shooting with a wide variety of 9 mm Luger ammunition. Although the pistol can safely fire +P rated ammunition, the manufacturer does not recommend a regular diet of increased-pressure loads. The pistol proved to be utterly reliable with ammunition ranging from less expensive practice fodder to high-end +P defensive loads. No malfunctions occurred during the course of formal and informal testing.</p><p>Formal benchrest accuracy testing was conducted with targets posted at 25 yards. The five-shot groups fired at that distance did not exceed 3 inches in size, with some groups as small as 2.25 inches. The best-performing ammunition of the day was <a href="http://store.chencustom.com/" target="_blank">ASYM Precision’s</a> 124-grain +P bonded jacketed hollow points with a five-group average of 2.50 inches.</p><p>Although polymer-frame, striker-fired pistols continue to gain popularity in the growing defensive handgun market, the old-school double-action/single action “wonder nines” still have their place. The TriStar C-100 9 mm pistol offers an excellent balance of form and function at a reasonable price. The grip shape and size is comfortable for most hand sizes, and the moderate level of recoil will suit new shooters as well as the seasoned. Loaded with quality ammunition, this pistol provides a level of accuracy on par with more expensive pistols.</p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Canik 55, Turkey</p><p><strong>Distributor:</strong> TriStar Sporting Arms ; (816) 421-1400; <a href="http://www.tristararms.com/" target="_blank">tristararms.com</a></p><p><strong>Caliber:</strong> 9 mm Luger</p><p><strong>Action Type:</strong> recoil-operated center-fire pistol</p><p><strong>Frame:</strong> aluminum alloy</p><p><strong>Barrel:</strong> 3.9"</p><p><strong>Rifling:</strong> six-groove, 1:18" RH twist</p><p><strong>Magazine:</strong> detachable-box; 15-round capacity</p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> luminescent windage adjustable three-dot</p><p><strong>Trigger:</strong> single-action, 4-lb.,11-oz.pull; double-action, 12-lb. pull</p><p><strong>Overall Length:</strong> 7.16"</p><p><strong>Width:</strong> 1.37"</p><p><strong>Height:</strong> 5"</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 24.48 ozs.</p><p><strong>Accessories:</strong> black hard case, two magazines, cleaning kit, lock</p><p><strong>Suggested Retail Price:</strong> $429</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/TriStarc100_Results.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-23179" title="TriStarc100_Results" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/TriStarc100_Results.jpg" alt="" width="644" height="369" /></a></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Trijicon Sealed Reflex Sight]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.trijicon.com/na_en/index.php" target="_blank">Trijicon</a> is well-known to service men and women for its Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG), which is fielded across the U.S. military. Another of the company’s U.S.-produced products, the Sealed Reflex Sight (SRS) reviewed here, benefits greatly from the trickle-down of its stable mate’s military-grade technology.</p><p>The SRS is a compact, red-dot sight conceived as a solution to what Trijicon describes as “tube effect,” or the visual occlusion of the shooter’s unaided field of view around the sight body, which can reduce situational awareness. It was also designed to be as small as possible. In addition, the SRS was designed to use the ubiquitous AA battery, augmented by a solar cell, to power its LED-generated, 1.75-m.o.a. dot reticle. Finally, the nitrogen-purged SRS was designed to be water-immersible to 165 feet.</p><p>The SRS’s housing is machined from a thick-walled aluminum forging. Its battery compartment cover is both knurled and slotted and is tethered to the sight with a small-gauge wire so as to preclude loss. The sight’s electronics use available current from the solar cell while the AA battery provides supplemental current to power the LED, which is adjustable through 10 settings. The solar cell significantly increases battery life during use in daylight. The LED will illuminate without a battery installed, but a battery must be present to power-up the sight initially. Battery life is said to be more than three years at setting “7” with a lithium battery at 70 degrees F.</p><p>Flush-fitting dials on the housing’s left side and rear can be turned using a cartridge rim to adjust windage and elevation, respectively. Call-offs are laser-engraved in white on the sight’s housing. Rubberized touch pads located on the housing’s left and right sides feature molded-in “+” and “-” markings and increase or decrease reticle brightness, respectively, when used independently. In addition, pressing either turns the sight on and pressing both simultaneously for two seconds turns the sight off.</p><p>We field tested the SRS, mounted on a flat-top .223 Rem. <a href="http://www.dpmsinc.com/" target="_blank">DPMS</a> AR-15, in Texas on an eradication exercise aimed at reducing the burgeoning hog and coyote population. Shooting from a helicopter at targets that were also in motion required an optic such as the SRS with its simple, easy-to-acquire reticle. The unit’s non-critical eye relief, and, therefore, mounting position, and its lack of parallax also proved important. Success resulted when the shooter simply placed the reticle at the appropriate area ahead of or behind the target and accounted for its and the aircraft’s speeds before firing.</p><p>After two days in the field, we noted no loss of zero even after rough handling. In addition, repeatability of adjustments was confirmed by shooting groups on paper targets at a range with the SRS mounted on a different .223 Rem.-cal. AR-15 rifle.</p><p>The Trijicon SRS is simple and robust and, because of its military-level quality, is priced accordingly. But the user who must have absolute confidence in a reflex sight will find the SRS to be an excellent choice.</p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Trijicon, Inc.; (800) 338-0563; <a href="http://www.trijicon.com/na_en/index.php" target="_blank">trijicon.com</a></p><p><strong>Magnification And Objective:</strong> 1X 28 mm</p><p><strong>Construction:</strong> forged and machined 7075-T6 aluminum housing</p><p><strong>Finish:</strong> hard-anodized matte black</p><p><strong>Field Of View (ft. at 100 yds.):</strong> 70</p><p><strong>Adjustments:</strong> 75 m.o.a.

              <title><![CDATA[Dirty Harry's Model 29: America's Shooting Star]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Out of production and somewhat obscure, the <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CustomContentDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=750001&amp;catalogId=750051&amp;content=11001" target="_blank">Smith &amp; Wesson</a> Model 29 was once well known only to serious big-bore handgunners. Then in 1971, it became one of the most famous and desirable handguns of all time. Do you know why? Well, do ya?</p><p>There is only a handful of motion pictures in which a specific gun played a starring role. “Winchester 73,” a 1950 Western that follows the trail of a stolen lever-action back to its rightful owner, and “Carbine Williams,” the 1952 film about David Marshal Williams and the M1 carbine, are two that come to mind. Interestingly, both starred Jimmy Stewart. But in these movies the guns took second billing to the starring character.</p><p>Such was not the case with “Dirty Harry” in 1971, starring Clint Eastwood, for the <a title="Take a look back at the Model 29. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13091&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=25" target="_blank">Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29</a> that he packed in a Bucheimer-Clark shoulder holster and that was interwoven into his movie character, Inspector Harry Callahan. Who can forget those taunting, haunting words uttered by Eastwood as he squinted down that 6½-inch barrel aimed at actor Albert “Poppy” Popwell:</p><p>“I know what you’re thinking. ‘Did he fire six shots or only five?’ Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement I kind of lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you’ve got to ask yourself one question: ‘Do I feel lucky?’ Well, do ya, punk?”</p><p>What erupted immediately after that wasn’t the roar of a .44 Mag., but a frenzied public clamoring for an S&amp;W Model 29-which, at that time, really was the most powerful commercially made handgun in the world. The sudden nationwide desire to own a .44 Mag. took S&amp;W by surprise, as prior to the release of “Dirty Harry,” demand for the bulky, hard-recoiling handgun had fallen so low that the Model 29-though still cataloged-was out of production. Then, overnight the Model 29 was on everybody’s “most wanted” list. As a result, Model 29s were selling for as much as three times their suggested retail price of $194-when they could be found.</p><p>Demand continued two years later when, in the “Dirty Harry” sequel “Magnum Force,” Eastwood repeats his “This is a 44. Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world” soliloquy during the opening credits, as he cocks and aims his Model 29 at the audience. As Dirty Harry, Eastwood packed his Model 29 three more times, in “The Enforcer” in 1976, in “Sudden Impact” in 1983, and finally in “The Dead Pool” in 1988, the last Dirty Harry movie he swore he’d ever make. But to this day, whenever a Dirty Harry movie airs on TV or cable, Model 29 sales surge.</p><p>The Dirty Harry blockbuster franchise was fortuitous for Eastwood (who took the role only after it had been turned down by Frank Sinatra, Steve McQueen and John Wayne, among others), Warner Brothers (who got the script when Universal Studios let the rights to it elapse), and most of all, S&amp;W, who had the right gun at the right time. But the Model 29 Eastwood packs in the films was not quite the gun originally depicted for his character in the script written by writer-producer-director and NRA board member John Milius, who wrote the first two films, although he is uncredited in the first one.</p><p>“This is the gun Dirty Harry should have used,” Milius told me at his home a few years ago, as he reached into his desk and pulled out a 4-inch barreled Model 29 with ivory stocks. Indeed, his Sept. 23, 1970, movie draft calls for exactly such a gun in nickeled finish. But, as previously noted, Model 29s were in short supply at the time (due to lack of demand, not popularity, as is commonly believed) and there were no 4-inch models to be had. Consequently, according to S&amp;W historian Roy Jinks, Kelly Lookabaugh, S&amp;W’s West Coast Representative who had close ties with Hollywood, brought a 6½-inch blued model to the Warner Brothers studios. The gun had been assembled in the late 1960s by Archie Dubia, foreman of S&amp;Ws hand-fitting department. Studios normally like to have at least one backup gun and preferably two, in case the primary gun gets damaged during filming. Thus, Milius lent, gave or brought (the details vary, depending on who you ask) two 6½-inch Model 29s to the studio. Later, he presented one of these guns to Clint Eastwood, who, last I heard, still has it.</p><p>But a different version of the first “Dirty Harry” Model 29s is chronicled by the Internet Movie Firearms Database (IMFDB). According to it, when a 4-inch Model 29 proved unobtainable, Eastwood personally contacted S&amp;W representative Bob Sauer, who in turn had Fred Miller (who originally had helped develop the production model of the .44 Magnum) at the factory assemble two guns, one with a 6½-inch barrel and the other with an 83⁄8 inch, from parts on hand.</p><p>It is unclear which of the two versions are true, but this much is known: after the completion of “Magnum Force,” Warner Brothers presented Milius with a Model 29 with an engraved silver shield inlaid on the left grip which reads:</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/65-EastwoodDEt.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-23203" title="65-EastwoodDEt" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/65-EastwoodDEt.jpg" alt="" width="354" height="336" /></a></p><p>The gun, serial number S206921, on loan from Milius, is currently on display at the <a href="http://www.nramuseum.org/" target="_blank">National Firearms Museum</a> in Fairfax, Va. Thus, we can lay to rest the recurring myth that because Model 29s were unobtainable during the filming of the first Dirty Harry film, the look-alike .41 Mag. Model 57 was used instead. As the facts attest, that simply is not true. And to further set the record straight, although the first guns used were N-frames, in the final three films the Model 29s used were all N-frames rented from Ellis Mercantile, a well-known Hollywood prop house no longer in business. In addition, a rubber mock-up Model 29 was used in scenes that called for the gun to be thrown. In one verified “Dirty Harry” incident filmed near Coit Tower, however, Eastwood throws his real gun, which is supposed to land on an off-camera padded blanket, but it misses. That metallic clattering you hear in the movie of the S&amp;W rattling along the sidewalk is real!</p><p>“That’s the gun I really wanted,” Milius lamented during the 2001 NRA Convention, “because you could prove it had real screen-time.” But that gun had disappeared. As an aside, the Bucheimer-Clark shoulder holster Eastwood used in the first two Dirty Harry films was rented from Ellis Mercantile but was for a gun with a 5-inch barrel, which caused the Model 29 Eastwood used to ride high in the rig.</p><p>Eastwood wasn’t the first actor to use a Model 29. In 1967 Lee Marvin packed a 4-inch version in “Point Blank,” faking recoil (only blanks are used in movies) in one scene, but forgetting to depict it in another. (On the other hand, Eastwood-ever the consummate actor-took a Model 29 to the shooting range to experience the recoil of a .44 Mag. so he could accurately portray firing the gun on screen.) And in 1973 James Bond, played by Roger Moore, used a nickeled version briefly in “Live and Let Die,” while 10 years later Chuck Norris upped the ante by brandishing an engraved, nickel-plated Model 29 as Texas Ranger J.J. McQuade in “Lone Wolf McQuade.” Nonetheless, the first actor to actually own a Model 29 was the late Jack Webb, star of TV’s “Dragnet.” On Feb. 29, 1956, S&amp;W presented the actor-producer-director-writer with serial number S130714 (Webb’s Dragnet character, Sgt. Joe Friday, carried badge number 714 on the popular detective show). It was the 12th .44 Magnum produced by Smith &amp; Wesson.</p><p>But television and movies aside, the real story of the Model 29 began during the late 1930s with a group of big-bore revolver aficionados, including such luminaries as Elmer Keith, P.O. Ackley and Townsend Whelen, who weren’t satisfied with the S&amp;W Registered .357 Mag., which at that time, really was “the most powerful handgun in the world.” They wanted something more, and just as the .38 Spl. begat the .357 Mag., they turned to the .44 Spl. as the basis for their proposed powerhouse cartridge. Having been developed in 1907 as a longer-cased smokeless-powder version of the old .44 Russian blackpowder cartridge, and specifically chambered in S&amp;W’s First Model Hand Ejector of 1908, a sturdy double-action also known as the Triple Lock, the .44 Spl. was loaded to blackpowder velocities, which did not do justice to cartridge or gun.</p><p>Leading the crusade for a “.44 Special Magnum,” as he called it, Keith proceeded to blow up numerous revolvers until at last he had the cartridge he wanted. He convinced Remington to manufacture it, but not before lengthening the .44 Spl. case one-tenth of an inch, to keep others from duplicating Keith’s cylinder-exploding exploits. The result was the .44 Rem. Mag. cartridge, which fired a 240-grain Keith-designed bullet at 1,400 fps. At 50 yards, it hit with more than 750 ft.-lbs. of energy, almost double that of the .357 Mag. cartridge.</p><p>All that was needed was a handgun capable of handling the cartridge. For that, S&amp;W turned to its S-frame Triple Lock, which by then had evolved into the Hand Ejector Fourth Model, better known as the 1950 Target Model in .44 Spl. (later to become the Model 24) and the 1955 Target Model (basically the same gun but in .45 caliber and with a heavier barrel; later it became the Model 25). But first some tweaking had to be done, which included lengthening the cylinder to close up the barrel-cylinder gap and incorporating recessed chambers. When completed, the gun weighed 48 ounces, which helped tame the recoil. As that was before S&amp;W started incorporating model numbers for its handguns, the behemoth six-shot revolver was simply called the “.44 Magnum,” which was rollmarked along the right side of the barrel.</p><p>“The first .44 Magnum built was in December 1955,” notes Jinks. “The serial numbers started at S131700 and were mixed up in the early production with some of the early production guns having serial numbers as high as S167124. The reason for this was that the factory was using frames that had already been built, but were for the .45 Target Model of 1955. That frame was already set up for the heavy barrel that was going on the .44 Magnums.”</p><p>On Dec. 29, .44 Magnum number S130806, the second gun to be produced, was presented to R.H. Coleman of Remington Arms Co. On Jan. 19, 1956, the revolver was officially announced to the public. The initial price was $135, but was almost immediately raised to $140. The gun was housed in a satin-lined black wooden case embossed with “.44 Magnum” and the S&amp;W logo on the lid. Inside were a screwdriver, cleaning rod, and wire brush and cotton swab attachments. The .44 Magnum was available in either a 4-inch or 6½-inch barrel, fitted with Goncala Alves target stocks, and came in blue or nickel finish, with case hardened hammer and trigger and Micro Adjustable sights.</p><p>Of the guns produced in January 1956, serial number S147220, went to Keith and number S130942 was shipped to Maj. Gen. Julian S. Hatcher, Technical Editor of <em>The American Rifleman</em>. Other notable gunwriters also received 6½-inch-barreled versions. Hatcher’s review of the .44 Magnum appeared in this magazine’s March 1956 issue. Needless to say, the gun was an instant success, with about 3,100 made that year. The .44 Magnum appealed to hunters impressed with Keith’s tales of long-range kills made with it. The law enforcement community was equally enamored with the .44 Magnum’s potential for stopping cars at substantially closer distances. It soon became apparent, however, that shooting such a heavy-recoiling handgun wasn’t something to do for any length of time. Stoking it with milder .44 Spl. Loads-which also chambered in the .44 Magnum-soon became <em>de rigueur</em>.</p><p>I succumbed to Model 29 fever in 1979. Until then, as a gunwriter just starting out penning articles for this magazine and others, I couldn’t afford the inflated Model 29 prices. But that year, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, then a true outdoor outfitter, was opening a store in Beverly Hills and had an allocation of three Model 29s-one in each barrel length. And they were going to be sold at retail price, which at that time had climbed to $354.50, with the 83⁄8-inch barrel (which always brought a premium) at $366. When A&amp;F’s doors opened that first day I sprinted up the steps two at a time to the mezzanine where the gun department was located and slapped my money down for the 83⁄8-inch model.</p><p>I still have it, along with a few others, including a 6½-inch version shipped as a test gun in 1957 to an unidentified gunwriter in New York who marked the frame with his distinctive six-dot punch pattern. He had fired so many full-house loads through it that I had to have the barrel turned back to 6¼ inches to reduce the cylinder gap.</p><p>Interestingly, the earliest guns had right-hand threads on the ejector rod screw, which caused it to back out and jam due to recoil. From Model variation 29-1 on, that was changed to left-hand threads, solving the problem. Reflecting a change in designation throughout the Smith &amp; Wesson line, in late 1957, starting with serial number S179000, the .44 Magnum became the Model 29. As Jinks notes, however, the changeover was sporadic, and between 1957 and 1958 guns marked both .44 Magnum and Model 29 were shipped concurrently.</p><p>The 83⁄8-inch barrel was added in November 1958 and the black wooden case was changed to mahogany in 1960. The Gun Control Act of 1968 resulted in the S-frame designation being changed to an N-frame prefix, and in 1979 the 6½-inch barrel was shortened to 6 inches in order to standardize production, according to Jinks, who actually suggested the change. In 1981, the counterbored cylinder chambers and pinned barrel were eliminated as both were unnecessary. Later, the pivoting, hammer-mounted firing pin was changed to a frame-mounted version. Other internal modifications continued through the 1990s, including improved yoke retention and longer cylinder locking bolts.</p><p>Externally the Model 29 received many makeovers, including Model 629 stainless steel versions and Performance Center specials, plus barrel lengths ranging from an exclusive three-incher for distributor Lew Horton to a 105⁄8-inch factory Silhouette model. In addition, in chronological order, there were five-, four-, and three-screw models. In 1999 the Model 29 was discontinued, but, in 2006 it was brought back as a 50th Anniversary Commemorative (technically missing it by a year) with a 6½-inch barrel and engraved gold medallion on the frame. Today the Model 29 is still available as a limited-production Classic Model in nickel or blued finish (albeit with a key lock on the left side plate) with a 4- or 6½-inch barrel. Plus, handsome laser-etched versions of the gun were introduced in 2009 and 2010. Unfortunately, according to Paul Pluff, S&amp;W’s director of marketing/customer service, “We do not have any new Model 29s that have been recently or [are] going to be released.”</p><p>Whether or not that situation continues remains to be seen. After all, in a 2008 survey, 20th Century Fox asked moviegoers to name their favorite on-screen arms. The Model 29 came in second only to Luke Skywalker’s lightsaber. Frankly, I’d take the Model 29 over the lightsaber any day. It has far greater range and doesn’t need special effects to make it work. I kind of think Dirty Harry would agree.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/xW8749_TAR-6140.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-23208" title="xW8749_TAR-6140" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/xW8749_TAR-6140.jpg" alt="" width="508" height="271" /></a></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Gentlemen, This is the New Model 1100]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.remington.com/" target="_blank">Remington</a> introduced its first semi-automatic shotgun in 1906. Called the Remington Autoloading Shotgun and then the Model 11, it was basically an American version of the Belgian-made Browning Auto-5 with a few differences, such as no magazine cut-off and a slightly different barrel design. Both were designed by John Browning. Just more than 850,000 Model 11s were built before it was replaced by the Model 11-48 in 1948. The streamlined receiver of the new shotgun was a sign of more modern things to come at Remington, but it still utilized Browning’s long-recoil design in which both the bolt and barrel traveled to the rear during firing.</p><p>It was no secret that a gas-operated shotgun had been under development at several American firearm companies, and it was commonly assumed that either Remington or Winchester would be first to introduce one. Instead, in 1956 Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. beat everyone to the punch with its new J.C. Higgins Model 60 in 12 gauge. Capable of handling all 2 ¾-inch loads, it was designed and built for Sears by the High Standard Mfg. Corp.</p><p>During the 1930s Remington had produced its Model 500 series of bolt-action and semi-automatic rifles in .22, of interest because of their interchangeable parts. That “firearm family” proved to be successful, and during the late 1940s management decided to expand on the concept by developing a series of shotguns and center-fire rifles with similar receivers and some parts commonality.</p><p>First to be introduced in 1950 was the <a title="Learn more about the Remington 870 ShurShot Turkey. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=20171" target="_blank">Model 870</a> pump shotgun. It was followed two years later by the Model 760 center-fire rifle on the same type of action. The Model 740, a gas-operated rifle in .30-’06 Sprg., came along in 1955. The next member to join the family was Remington’s first gas-powered shotgun, the Sportsman 58. It was introduced in 1956, shortly after J.C. Higgins guns began to appear on the shelves of Sears stores across the country. Unlike the Model 60, which handled both light and heavy 2¾-inch loads, the Sportsman 58 was equipped with a “Dial-A-Matic” magazine cap with gas vents of different sizes. When a light target load was to be used, the cap was twisted to “L”; twisting it to “H” readied the gun for heavy field loads.</p><p>In 1959, Remington introduced its second gas-operated shotgun called the Model 878 Automaster. It was much like the Sportsman 58 except its self-compensating gas piston allowed the use of both light and heavy loads without making any mechanical adjustment.</p><p>The Sportsman 58 and Model 878 were designed by a team headed by L.R. Crittendon and, while many hunters and clay target shooters loved the two guns, Remington management acknowledged the fact that both fell short of perfection. For close to three years a young engineer by the name of Wayne Leek and his team consisting of Clark Workman, James Martin, R.P. Kelly and Charles Morse devoted a big part of their time to making improvements to the Model 878. They eventually came up with a shotgun that would go on to become second only in popularity to the Model 870 pump. When introducing it to members of Remington’s advertising agency in December 1962, Leek proudly stated “Gentlemen, this is the new Model 1100, and it’s going to revolutionize shotgun shooting.” And indeed it did.</p><p>Every person involved in the design of the Model 1100 was either a hunter or an avid clay target shooter, and some were both. One of their goals was to produce a shotgun that was easy to keep clean when subjected to high-volume shooting. The gas pistons of other shotguns were located inside the magazine tubes. Locating it on the outside of the tube of the Model 1100 made everything easily accessible for cleaning. And yet the compactness of the piston and its associated parts resulted in a trimmer fore-end than on other gas-operated guns. Moving the gas port of the barrel closer to the chamber where pressure was higher resulted in less buildup of propellant fouling in the system.</p><p>In those days a computer filled a good-sized room, and one of those along with an oscilloscope revealed that the new gas-handling design prolonged the recoil curve, thereby reducing perceived recoil compared not only to recoil-operated shotguns but to other gas guns as well. Guns that were function-tested after being frozen at 32 degrees below zero overnight never missed a lick. Oil-coated guns were dropped into sand pits, others were submerged in water. All came out shooting. The barrels of test guns subjected to sustained-firing became so hot their fore-ends began to smoke. More than half-a-million shells were fired.</p><p>To make sure the balance and feel of the new gun would satisfy as many shooters as possible, dozens of Remington employees were asked to shoot guns with varying stock dimensions. Their opinions and suggestions had a lot of influence on final stock design and shape. Pointing and swinging qualities of the gun were further improved by positioning its balance point a bit closer to the shooter’s forward hand than the rear. That was accomplished in part by making the receiver as trim as possible. Years ago, the late Don Zutz wrote that the Model 1100 receiver is actually shallower than some over-under shotguns. He was right. I have a Remington Model 3200 in 12 gauge, and its receiver at the standing breech is 0.280 inches deeper than the 12-gauge Model 1100. In fact, the Model 1100 receiver is both shallower and thinner than the receiver of my 1960s-vintage Winchester 101 in 20 gauge.</p><p>The stock and fore-end of early guns had impressed checkering and were given an extremely durable polyurethane finish originally developed by DuPont for use on bowling pins. To illustrate its toughness, Remington produced a promotional film starring employees Earl Larson, Jack Heath and Dick Baldwin in which stocks set up in a bowling alley were repeatedly knocked asunder. It also had a special rack installed on the roof of the factory in order to expose dozens of stocks to the elements for several weeks.</p><p>The Model 1100 was announced in January 1963 in 12 gauge only at $149.95 for a plain barrel and $174.95 for a barrel with ventilated rib. At the time, the plain-barrel Browning Auto-5 was selling for $154.95 and Winchester’s lightweight Model 59 with its fiberglass-reinforced barrel was going for $149.95. Model 1100s in Field, Skeet and Trap configurations were chambered for the 2 ¾-inch shell but a Magnum Duck Gun with 3-inch chamber was also offered. During the next year, 16 and 20 gauges were added to the Field and the Skeet guns. The 12-gauge Deer Gun with adjustable sights and 22-inch smoothbore barrel made its debut in 1966. Three years later a 20-gauge Deer Gun was introduced.</p><p>In 1969 the first 1100s in 28 gauge and .410 bore were built, both on a smaller receiver. Field guns had stocks of mahogany, while Skeet guns wore walnut. The smallbore Skeet guns were later offered individually but, during the first year of production, they were available only as a sequentially serial numbered pair in a hard case. Production of the Matched Pairs ceased in 1970 with 5,067 built, although the remaining stock lasted until 1972.</p><p>Through 1969, all 20-gauge Model 1100s were built on the 12-gauge receiver. A Lightweight version with a mahogany stock was offered, but it still weighed only a few ounces less than a 12-gauge gun. Skeet shooters absolutely loved the weight for its reduction in recoil, and even today those guns bring a premium on the used gun market, if one can be found.</p><p>Trap shooters probably welcomed the new Model 1100 even more. Whereas skeet shooters use light loads and prefer to shoot the lighter-kicking 20, 28 and .410 shells, trap shooters shoot only heavy 12-gauge loads. Even today Model 1100s continue to be used by several of the trap shooters at my gun club.</p><p>The standard 12-gauge Model 1100 weighed 7 pounds, 8 ounces, while the magnum version weighed a quarter-pound more. Target shooters and hunters were quite happy with those weights but most hunters considered the 20-gauge gun on the 12-gauge receiver heavier than necessary. And since hunters were buying far more shotguns than were clay target shooters, the Lightweight 20 on the 28/.410 receiver was introduced in 1970. To my knowledge, the Model 1100 and the Model 11-48 are the only two semi-automatic shotguns ever produced in 12, 16, 20, 28 and .410.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Remington1100Shotgun2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-23222" title="Remington1100Shotgun" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Remington1100Shotgun2-1024x295.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="168" /></a></p><p>Jay Bunting of Remington, who shot skeet with 1100s for many years, recently pointed out to me that the Lightweight 20 was made in two versions. The LW-20 offered from 1970 to 1976 had a short barrel extension much like the Model 870, while the LT-20, which replaced it in 1977, had a standard-length extension with integral ejection stud and an enlarged ejection port. Both versions were originally chambered only for the 2 ¾-inch shell, but in 1971 the LT became available with a 3-inch chamber.</p><p>The one-millionth Model 1100 came off the production line in 1972. During that same year, left-hand 12- and 20-gauge Field and Skeet guns with the ejection port on the left side of the receiver and the safety reversed for the southpaw shooter were introduced. Model 1100 production reached the 2,000,000 mark in March 1977. The left-hand gun in 20 gauge was discontinued in 1978 and the 20-gauge Deer Gun on the 12-gauge receiver was replaced by one on the 28/.410 receiver. Also during that year, the mahogany stock of the LT-20 Field was replaced with walnut.</p><p>The standard Field gun was designed to function only with the 2 ¾-inch shell while the Magnum was intended exclusively for the 3-inch shell. In those days it was quite common for a shooter to own one Model 1100 and several barrels with different choke constrictions. To add a bit more sales appeal to the Magnum gun, Remington modified it in 1979 so it could be used with an extra barrel chambered for the 2 ¾-inch shell.</p><p>Model 1100 production reached 3,000,000 in 1983. That was also the year a left-hand version of the Deer Gun in 12 gauge was introduced, as was the Special Field in 12 and 20 gauges with straight-grip stock and stubby 21-inch, ventilated-rib barrel. The year 1985 saw the introduction of the Special Purpose Magnum, an economy-grade waterfowl and turkey gun with a birch stock and dull blued finish.</p><p>Selling extra barrels for its shotguns had long been quite profitable for Remington and the company resisted offering screw-in chokes long after they became available on guns from other manufacturers. The Rem Choke system was introduced in 1986.</p><p>The Model 11-87-capable of handling both the 2 ¾- and 3-inch interchangeably and introduced in 1987-did not replace the Model 1100, but the passing of each year brought a reduction in the number of Model 1100 variations offered. Interchangeability matters not to clay target shooters, but when steel shot became a requirement on waterfowl, guns that could not take both 2¾- and 3-inch shells lost market share. By 1988 only the Special Field was offered in 12 gauge although Field guns in 20, 28 and .410 as well as Skeet guns in those chamberings were still cataloged. When the 1991 catalog was published only the “Small Gauge” Field gun in 20, 28 and .410 and the 20-gauge Youth Gun with short length of pull and a 21-inch barrel made the cut. By 1995 most field-grade Model 1100s had been discontinued although others would continue to be occasionally offered on a limited basis.</p><p>As I write this, Remington is offering six standard-production variants. Twelve-gauge guns include: the Competition, with fancy walnut stock and 30-inch backbored barrel with lengthened forcing cone; the Competition Synthetic, with a stock quick-adjustable for cast, length of pull and comb height; the Classic Trap, with high-comb walnut stock and 30-inch Rem Choke barrel; and the Tactical, with black synthetic stock, 22-inch ventilated-rib barrel and eight-round magazine. The Sporting is offered in 12 and 20 gauges while the Premier Sporting, with its fancy walnut and nickel-plated receiver and gold inlay, is available in 12, 20 and 28 gauges and .410 bore. Available during 2013 is the 12-gauge, 50th Anniversary Limited Edition with B-Grade walnut, 1963 prefix serial number and machine-engraved receiver.</p><p>The Model 1100 is more prone to parts breakage than some designs, but that mattered less to hunters than to those who shot many thousands of rounds each year on the trap and skeet fields. Even when a part broke, its replacement was cheap and usually easy to install. Most clay target shooters kept on hand spare parts such as the action spring, barrel seal, link and piston seal. Several of the guys at my gun club competed during the glory days of the Model 1100, and one recently told me that he usually replaced the action spring about every 12,000 rounds, whether it needed it or not.</p><p>The Model 1100 was an even bigger hit among hunters. For as long as I can remember, my father hunted quail several days each week of the season and while he was a double man at heart, the gun he used most during his last 25 years in the field was a LT-20 skeet gun. He gave it a good cleaning every couple of months and the only part that ever broke was a barrel seal, an inexpensive rubber O-ring that slips over the magazine tube.</p><p>The autoloading shotgun market is much broader today, with some guns better in ways than the Model 1100-including the improved Remington Model 11-87-but few manufacturers have managed to duplicate its handling qualities. The fact that upward of 4,000,000 have been sold since its introduction half a century ago is proof that Wayne Leek and his team got it right.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/1100Breakdown1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-23227" title="1100Breakdown" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/1100Breakdown1-1024x245.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="139" /></a></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[1911s Tighter]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>In a recent <a title="Read Wiley's blog on M1911s. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blogs/m1911-and-m1911a1" target="_blank">blog</a>, I talked about the differences between the M1911 and M1911A1 pistols. A number of readers were kind enough to write in with favorable comments, which are much appreciated. If this kind of commentary is of use to my readers, I’ll try to include more of it in these electronic pages. Let me know what you would like to hear about and I’ll try to meet those requests.</p><p>I was delighted to hear from a reader named John Browning. No, it wasn’t the famous one that died in 1926, but rather a gentleman named John W. Browning. He was inquisitive about the quality of the original 1911-era pistols being made to tighter specs than later guns. This is a matter that surfaces from time to time. To answer the question, I contacted one of the nation’s best pistolsmiths, who also happens to be a serious M1911/M1911A1 collector. He once had the opportunity to detail strip M1911 pistol, No. 9.</p><p>From this background, he replied instantly to the question: “Are original 1911s made to tighter specs than later ones?” No, they were not. Intended for rough service in field conditions, the 1911 was developed and produced with a certain amount of room for crud to accumulate before cleaning. The military services are often maniacal about clean weapons of all kinds, but they are realistic enough to know that there are times when it’s impossible. The first use of the 1911 may have been in the Punitive expedition into Mexico in 1916, which was a very sandy, dusty environment. For good reason, there is no major difference in specs for GI 1911s.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Support-Hand Draw]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>There are many reasons why you would want or need to draw your defensive handgun with your support hand. It could be that your gun hand or arm is injured, or that you are defending against a close attacker with your stronger arm.</p><p>Regardless of the reason, knowing how to draw your handgun with your support hand is a good skill to have. Of course, a lot of it has to do with where your gun is located, but most carry methods can be accessed with either hand with some practice, which should always begin with an unloaded or inert gun.</p><p>Sheriff Jim Wilson recently <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/support-hand-shooting" target="_blank">explained two methods</a> for drawing a handgun with the support hand, and the issues that should be considered for this to be possible. Both of these, though, were explained from the strong-side position, which is not used by everyone. Personally, I believe the best way to provide a firearm for the support hand is a second firearm.</p><p>Sure, I have trained reaching my <a href="http://www.kimberamerica.com/" target="_blank">Kimber</a> with my support hand, but regardless of how much I practice, it just doesn’t feel smooth, and I can see this being a problem in a real situation. For this reason, I prefer a second handgun located in a position that is more easily accessible with the support hand, such as in the pocket or on the ankle. Beyond the better access to a handgun if the strong arm is disabled or otherwise engaged, a second handgun provides additional firepower and can be handed off to a partner if needed.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Excels All Others: The Spencer Carbine]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Upon returning from veteran furlough in the spring of 1864, the Seventh Pennsylvania Cavalry was issued Model 1860 Spencer carbines. A few days later, on the skirmish line, the men noticed a number of hogs rooting in the woods in front of their position. Before the officers could stop the firing, a number of pigs became supper for the men. A few troopers were arrested for killing the pigs, not because of the consumed swine, but because it was against orders to fire at any object other than a “gray-jacket.” On a more serious note, simply put, the .52-cal. M1860 Spencer carbine was the most advanced carbine in service during the American Civil War.</p><p>United States Patent No. 27,393, dated March 6, 1860, was granted to Christopher M. Spencer for his breechloading, repeating design. The tubular magazine, located in the buttstock, held seven rimfire cartridges. Lowering the operating lever, which also served as the trigger guard, ejected the fired case and automatically fed the next round into the chamber from the magazine. With the action closed, the hammer was then cocked, and the Spencer was ready to fire again.</p><p>The wartime Model 1860 Spencer carbine weighed 8 pounds, 4 ounces and had an overall length of 39 inches. The 22-inch-long blued barrel, secured to the stock by a single band, had a brass blade front sight, and the folding rear sight-secured by a curved spring base-was graduated out to 800 yards. A sling swivel was located on the buttstock, and there was a sling ring and bar on the carbine’s left-side grip area.</p><p>The serial number is found at the rear of the breech. On the Model 1860, the flat top surface of the receiver was stamped:<strong></strong></p><p><strong>SPENCER REPEATING</p><p>RIFLE CO. BOSTON MASS</p><p>PAT’D MARCH 6, 1860</strong></p><p>As the Spencer Repeating Rifle Co. was completing its contract with the U.S. Army for 7,500 30-inch-barreled Spencer rifles in June 1863, the company requested a contract for an additional 11,000 carbines at $25 each, which was awarded on July 13, 1863. Deliveries started in October, and by the end of the year the government received 7,000 carbines. In December, the contract was revised to state that the U.S. Ordnance Dept. would take delivery of 34,500 carbines in 1864 at the same price of $25. Another wartime contract of May 24, 1864, stated that the Army would take the entire production fabricated by the Spencer factory through Sept. 1, 1865. The accoutrements included in the contracts were a cleaning brush and thong, plus screwdrivers to take the gun down. By the time the wartime contracts were completed on Jan. 1, 1866, the Spencer factory had delivered 64,685 carbines.</p><p><strong>Field Service 1863-1865</strong></p><p>The first Spencer carbines did not reach the field until late 1863, at which time three cavalry regiments reported having nearly 1,000 Spencer carbines, but, by the winter of 1864, several Army of the Potomac cavalry regiments had been rearmed with M1860 Spencer carbines. In the failed Judson Kilpatrick-Ulric Dahlgren attempted raid on Richmond in February 1864-in which Dahlgren was killed-59 Spencer carbines were reported lost.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/xW8750_TAR-61622.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-23274" title="xW8750_TAR-6162" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/xW8750_TAR-61622-1024x228.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="130" /></a></p><p>The firepower of the Spencer carbines was apparent in the action at Parker’s Store in the densely wooded area of the Wilderness on the morning on May 5, 1864. The 500 members of the Fifth New York Cavalry dismounted and formed a loose skirmish line, and there they were attacked by a division of Confederate infantry. For three hours the men of the Fifth held off the Southern attacks until they started to run out of ammunition for their Spencers, which forced the Federals to pull back. The Confederates opposing them believed that they had been fighting an entire brigade. The Fifth New York suffered about 80 casualties in the action.</p><p>By September 1864, 9,000 Spencer carbines were in field service for the Union, and they were highly regarded. The field reports from 10 officers of the Fourth U.S. Cavalry rated the Spencer carbine the best arm in cavalry service. Brevet Maj. Gen. James Wilson felt that the Spencers were the best firearms ever put into the hands of the soldier. He stated that the Spencer “excels all others in use in durability, rapidity of fire, and general effectiveness.”</p><p>In Wilson’s 1865 raid through the Deep South, his men were mainly armed with Spencers and equipped with Blakeslee cartridge boxes. Late in the war the Ordnance Dept. placed orders for 32,000 Blakeslee cavalry cartridge boxes, which were the invention of Col. Erastus Blakeslee of the First Connecticut Cavalry. They were designed to carry 10 tinned tubes containing seven Spencer cartridges each, giving cavalrymen an additional 70 cartridges at their fingertips. This gave soldiers tremendous potential firepower, and prior to the raid Wilson requested that his men be issued a quantity of the Blakeslees.</p><p>Late on the afternoon of April 2, 1865, 1,550 Union cavalrymen, armed mainly with Spencer carbines and rifles, waited for the order to attack the Confederate defensive positions at Selma, Ala. The attack was being made by Brig. Gen. Eli Long’s Division of Wilson’s Cavalry. Before the attackers even reached the Confederate defensive positions, they had to cover 600 yards of open fields. In front of the Confederate positions was a stockade of cedar posts 5 foot high, sharpened at the top. They then had to cover additional open space before coming to a 5-foot deep ditch and then climb a 15-foot embankment, all the while being fired on by the Confederates. They were commanded by one of the South’s best generals, Lt. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest. At 5 p.m., the order was given to advance. The enemy opened fire with artillery and musket fire, but the cavalrymen marched steadily forward in a single line firing their Spencers as rapidly as possible. The command was given to charge when within 150 yards of the Confederate works. With a cheer the cavalrymen started on a run for the Rebel lines. Up and over they went, capturing the positions within 25 minutes of the action’s start, and in which the attackers suffered about 300 casualties. After the capture of Selma, Wilson’s Cavalry continued on to Macon, Ga., where they were informed that the war was over.</p><p>The spring of 1865 found the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac located around Petersburg, Va., and it reported 5,300 Spencer carbines in field service. On the last day of March, Sheridan’s cavalry was attacked by Confederate infantry and cavalry at Dinwiddie Court House. On the march to the court house, the troopers found the roads nearly impassable. Conditions were so bad, a private from the Second Ohio Cavalry nearly drowned when his horse fell in a water-filled hole in the middle of the road. The trooper-loaded down with his Spencer carbine, 40 rounds of ammunition and full haversack-disappeared entirely in the mud and water, and only the quick help of his friends saved him. The archives remain silent on the fate of his horse. The Confederates were in the process of flanking the First New Jersey Cavalry during the battle, and Sgt. John Wilson from Company L and one other trooper slowed the rebel advance long enough to allow the withdrawal of the lead horses. Sgt. Wilson shot two of the rebel color bearers, and for his actions was awarded the Medal of Honor. Yet another trooper had a cartridge jammed in his carbine, rendering it useless, so he took a Spencer and ammunition from a wounded soldier going to the rear, and continued the fight.</p><p>That battle and the next day’s action at Five Forks-plus the breakthrough around Petersburg-forced Lee to evacuate Petersburg and Richmond. The war in Virginia was over a week later on April 9, 1865, with Lee’s surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House.</p><p><strong>Model 1865 Spencer Carbines</strong></p><p>The fall of 1864 and the early months of 1865 saw three major changes to the Spencer carbines being delivered on existing Army contracts, resulting in a nomenclature change to the Model 1865. In November 1864, the Ordnance Dept. directed that the carbines be chambered for the new standard rimfire round, .56-50, replacing the .56-56. The new .56-50 ammunition could chamber in the older M1860 carbines, but the earlier .56-56 would not chamber in the new carbines. The .56-50-chambered guns were stamped on the receiver “Model 1865,” and the barrel length was shortened to 20 inches.</p><p>One final improvement was the March 1865 incorporation of the Stabler cut-off attachment, which was invented by Edward Stabler of Sandy Springs, Md. It allowed the carbine to be fired as a single-shot with the seven cartridges in the magazine being held in reserve. Stabler was paid a royalty of 25 cents for each carbine fabricated with his magazine cut-off device.</p><p>On June 27, 1864, the Burnside Rifle Co. entered into a contract with the Ordnance Dept. to manufacture 30,500 .52-cal. M1860 Spencer carbines with deliveries completed by Aug. 31, 1865. With the changes directed to be made to the carbines, deliveries did not start until April 15, 1865, and they continued until the end of October, with a 30,496 M1865 Spencer carbines being delivered. Six additional carbines were delivered as samples, prototypes and models. Of this number, 14,494 were equipped with the Stabler cut-off and 16,008 without.</p><p>The company paid Spencer Repeating Rifle Co. a royalty of 50 cents for each carbine delivered to the Ordnance Dept., and $1 was paid for the 4,000 Spencer carbines sold to military individuals and civilians.</p><p>The Spencer factory manufactured nearly 23,000 M1865 Spencer carbines, of which 12,502 were equipped with the Stabler cut-off. In the post-war period, Springfield Armory retrofitted about 12,000 M1860s to incorporate M1865 features.</p><p>The .56-50-cal. M1865 Spencer carbines manufactured by the Burnside Rifle Co. and the Spencer Repeating Rifle Co. weighed 8 pounds, 5 ounces with 20-inch barrels, and they had an overall length of 37 inches. The Burnside receivers were stamped:<strong></strong></p><p><strong>MODEL 1865</p><p>SPENCER REPEATING RIFLE</p><p>PAT’D MARCH 6, 1860</p><p>MANUFACTURED AT PROV.R.I.</p><p>BY BURNSIDE RIFLE CO.</strong></p><p>The Spencer factory carbines had the both the M1860 stamping and the M1865. A saddle bar and ring was located on the buttstock’s left, and sling swivels were located on the barrel band and underside of the buttstock.</p><p>In 1871, Springfield Armory converted 1,109 M1865 Spencer carbines manufactured by Burnside into rifles, replacing the carbine barrels with 32-inch-long standard M1868 Springfield rifle barrels and fore-ends secured by two barrel bands. The converted rifles retained the carbine’s saddle bars and rings on the left side of their buttstocks. It does not appear that those converted rifles were ever issued.</p><p><strong>Post-War Field Service</strong></p><p>The years after the Civil War saw the U.S. Cavalry assigned to various outposts on the frontier, and in 1866, four additional cavalry regiments were organized for frontier duty, with the last two being the U.S. Ninth and 10th Cavalries, better known as “Buffalo Soldiers.” They, along with the rest of the Army, tried to maintain order and protect against hostile Indian attacks. The M1865 Spencer carbine was the standard in post-war service and remained in service into the middle 1870s.</p><p>One of the largest Indian raids into Texas occurred in July 1870. Chief Kicking Bird led 100 Kiowa warriors from Fort Sill Reservation on a raid into Texas. On the Wichita River, the raiders came in contact with a detachment of 55 Sixth U.S. Cavalry troopers from Fort Richardson. Totally surrounded, the cavalrymen-armed with Spencer carbines-fought a delaying retreat. The men dismounted and led their horses, and in the four-hour engagement before the Indians called off the attack, the cavalrymen suffered two dead and 11 wounded. The Kiowa losses were 15 killed and several wounded. For their conspicuous acts of bravery, nine cavalrymen were awarded the Medal of Honor.</p><p>Two years later, Captain Jack and his Modocs moved into the lava beds of Northern California in late 1872 after a clash with the cavalry, and a portion of the Spencer carbine-armed First U.S. Cavalry and the Warm Springs Indian scouts were sent to force them out of the lava beds. The siege of Captain Jack’s position lasted several months and finally ended in the summer of 1873, at which time Captain Jack abandoned the stronghold. Then the troopers-with the assistance of the Warm Springs scouts-tracked the Modocs down and Captain Jack was captured and later hanged.</p><p>Spencers were replaced by the .45-70 Gov’t Model 1873 Springfield carbines, and it was with the newly issued single-shot Model 1873 “Trapdoor” that troopers of Lt. Col. George Custer’s U.S. Seventh Cavalry entered the Little Big Horn on June 25, 1876. What influence-if any-the seven-shot, repeating Spencers may have had on “Custer’s Last Stand” would be pure conjecture, but the Spencer’s firepower relied on by the U.S. Cavalry since 1863 was assuredly missed.</p>]]></bodyContent>

He returned just a few minutes later with a wooden club and began attacking the owner's wife, Sylvia Armen, who was working in the store at the time. The owner, Alfred Armen, heard the commotion and ran to his wife's aid. He tried to defend his wife and fought with the suspect before shooting him fatally. Mr. and Mrs. Armen were later taken to a hospital with head injuries and are expected to recover. According to police, there was no motive behind the attack.

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to reloading, a cardboard box brimming with .357 Mag. or .223 Rem. brass represents a daunting task. A powder measure eases and speeds up the process by dispensing a charge with the flip of a lever; however, before the reloading begins a handloader needs to make sure the weights of those volumes of propellant remain constant from the first to the last cartridge.</p><p>How precisely a measure meters out propellant depends a great deal on the shape and size of the granules. Flake-shaped propellants pack tightly in a measure. But some, like Alliant’s Unique and Steel, are rather fluffy, which can lead to variations in dispensed weights. Cylindrical-shaped propellants vary quite a bit in length. These “stick” propellants with shorter granules, such as Hodgdon Benchmark and IMR 7828 Super Short Cut, flow easily through a measure. However, cylindrical versions with longer granules, such as H4831 and Reloder 22, fail to pack tightly in a measure’s reservoir. Such long sticks can also jam between the edge of the measure’s drum cavity and the measure. Force on the measure handle vibrates the apparatus and throws off the dispensed weight. Spherical propellants, such as the entire Ramshot line, closely pack in a measure reservoir and meter easily.</p><p>Properly operating a measure can decrease propellant weight deviations. A measure firmly mounted on a bench or screwed into a progressive reloading press keeps vibrations to a minimum. Throwing the handle up and down with the same force and cadence also helps keep weights consistent. Too, keeping the hopper near the same level lends a hand in throwing uniform charges. My Ohaus measure nearly filled with Alliant Power Pro 2000-MR spherical propellant varied only 0.1 grains-from the 37.0 grains it was set on-for the first 10 cycles of the measure. After 35 cycles, though, the propellant level in the hopper had dropped quite a bit, and the charge weight decreased 0.4 grains.</p><p>Placing a baffle in the bottom of a reservoir helps keep propellant at an even pressure as the reservoir drains. With the baffle in place to regulate flow, 37.0 grains of 2000-MR dropped only 0.2 grains after 35 cycles.</p><p><strong>Shooting Results</strong></p><p>To determine velocity variations with metered versus weighed charges I tried several different propellants in two revolver cartridges and three rifle cartridges and shot five, five-shot strings with each load. A five-shot string, with propellant weighed to 0.1 grain, was also fired with each of the five loads as a comparison.</p><p>Ramshot TAC is a fine-grained spherical propellant that compacts tightly in a measure’s reservoir. It flowed easily through my Ohaus, and measured charges fired 25 Berger 50-grain bullets with an extreme spread of only 27 fps from the .223 Rem. That spread was a bit lower than the 33 fps from weighed TAC.</p><p>Hodgdon Varget has relatively small extruded kernels., but granules can hang up in the measure and require a jerk on the handle to drop a charge. That caused an extreme spread of velocity of 48 fps shooting 25 Nosler 55-grain Varmageddon bullets through a .22-250 Rem., compared to 14 fps with the weighed charges.</p><p>IMR 4350 was the first propellant I loaded when I took up handloading 41 years ago. I may forget birthdays and anniversaries, but my .30-’06 Sprg. load back then was 55.0 grains of the propellant with Sierra 180-grain bullets. I dribbled the last few grains of the pencil lead-size granules in with my fingers to bring the charges up to the correct weight. Using a measure was about five times faster. Extreme spread was 80 fps for the measured loads, which was about twice the 42 fps for the weighed load. Average size of five metered groups was 1.41inches-nearly the same as for the weighed charge.</p><p>Unique’s fluffy flakes do not meter precisely from a measure. After setting my measure to throw 8.0 grains of Unique for .357 Mag. loads I weighed a few charges and they varied 0.2 grain. That weight inconsistency resulted in an average extreme spread of velocity of 111 fps for the Sierra 158-grain bullets. Still, the average velocity of 1,137 fps and 2.28-inch groups for those 25 shots were very close to the 1,151 fps speed and 1.83-inch group of weighed Unique.</p><p>TiteGroup spherical propellant measured more precisely. Speer 225-grain bullets fired with measured TiteGroup had an average velocity spread of 25 fps fired in a Ruger Super Blackhawk .44 Mag., which was only 4 fps more than weighed charge. Accuracy of the measured loads was also slightly better than that of the weighed group.</p><p>From this test, it’s clear that metered charges are capable of near-identical performance compared to weighed charges. As such, this would be the preferred method for high-volume loading.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PowderMeasureEval_web1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-23291" title="PowderMeasureEval_web" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PowderMeasureEval_web1.jpg" alt="" width="873" height="599" /></a></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[U.S. Model 1847 Cavalry Musketoon]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>In 1833, the United States took the daring step of arming its brand-new First Regiment of Dragoons with the innovative Hall carbine. That put America in the forefront of military technology by making it one of the premier nations to provide its regulars with percussion, breechloading firearms.</p><p>Through the years, the Hall underwent a series of modifications and alterations intended to improve loading and handling characteristics, but by the time the last model appeared in 1843, the system, which had been introduced in 1819, was considered a bit long-in-the-tooth. Other, more efficient mechanisms were appearing, and during its years of service there were some justified (and unjustified) complaints from the field about the Hall’s performance. Ultimately, it was decided that the Hall would be phased out.</p><p>The emergence of new, innovative firearms notwithstanding, conservative U.S. Ordnance Dept. officials decided the breechloading experiment could take a bit of a hiatus while they regrouped, and decided to equip mounted troops with an old-fashioned smoothbore muzzleloader.</p><p>Adopted in 1847, the percussion Cavalry Musketoon was actually an attenuated version of the excellent U.S. Model 1842 Musket. Manufactured at Springfield Armory, the 1847 was handsome and made to high manufacturing standards. All steel parts were polished bright, and the furniture was brass. The round, .69-cal. barrel measured 26-inches long-as opposed to the 1842’s 42-inch tube-and overall length was 41 inches. It weighed 7.4 pounds, about a pound less than the Model 1843 Hall.</p><p>A long sling bar was attached to the left side of the stock, and a button-head captive ramrod was attached to the barrel via a swivel setup mounted on a stud brazed just behind the muzzle. Despite the fact that swivel ramrods had been used successfully by other military forces since at least the early 19th century, the fixture on the 1847 was found to be fragile and prone to breakage. The solution was found by lengthening the rod and attaching it to the stock by a sleeved chain. Also, a spoon retainer was added to the inside of the stock. Most 1847s encountered today have swivels. Chained carbines are quite scarce, bring a premium and are often faked.</p><p>Though possessed of a tried-and-true system, the 1847 came in for a fair share of criticism. As well as the ramrod problem, troops carped that the bullets had a tendency to move forward in the barrel during field service. The guns were loaded with a round ball contained within a paper cartridge, so it’s understandable that the jouncing of a cavalry steed could cause the load to unseat, particularly when the carbines were carried on the saddle, muzzle-down, in a strap/boot arrangement.</p><p>Musketoons of similar pattern to the cavalry version were issued to artillery and sappers (engineers), the primary differences being the lack of a sling bar, the addition of sling swivels, separate ramrods and bayonet lugs.</p><p>Just more than 6,000 M1842 Cavalry Musketoons were made between 1847 and 1859, at which time the military again embraced the breechloader, primarily in the guise of the superb Sharps system. Some 1847s were also later rifled and fitted with adjustable rear sights.</p><p>The carbine depicted here is in superb condition, with the steel parts retaining their high polish, the walnut stock relatively free of blemishes and still showing its inspector’s cartouche. The brass is a mellow mustard color, and the mechanics and bore are in perfect condition. As such, this piece would easily bring between $5,500 and $6,000.</p><p><strong>Gun:</strong> U.S. Model 1847 Cavalry Musketoon</p><p><strong>Caliber:</strong> .69</p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Springfield Armory</p><p><strong>Serial number:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Manufactured:</strong> 1848</p><p><strong>Condition:</strong> NRA Antique Excellent</p><p><strong>Value:</strong> $5,500-$6,000</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/1847cavalryMusketoon_web.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-23303" title="1847cavalryMusketoon_web" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/1847cavalryMusketoon_web.jpg" alt="" width="532" height="359" /></a></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Nosler Varmageddon Rifle Package]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Premium bullet and ammunition maker <a href="http://www.nosler.com/" target="_blank">Nosler</a> has teamed up with rifle manufacturer <a href="http://www.noveskerifleworks.com/" target="_blank">Noveske</a> to produce the Varmageddon-a custom-designed AR available as a stand-alone rifle or as a package complete with signature <a href="http://www.leupold.com/" target="_blank">Leupold</a> scope. The latter is evaluated here.</p><p>The direct-gas-impingement, semi-automatic, magazine-fed Varmageddon has a variety of precision features. For example, the 18-inch, stainless-steel Noveske barrel has a 1:8-inch twist rate, which provides greater stability to a wide range of bullet weights. It features a bead-blasted matte finish and is chambered in 5.56x45 mm NATO with extended M4-style feed ramps at the rear of its extension.</p><p>The gas system is intermediate in length, with a gas tube that is 1.5-inch shorter than a standard-length gas tube. The low-profile gas block has been pinned onto the medium contour barrel. The front of the barrel has standard 1/2-inch×28 threads for installation of a muzzle break, flash hider or sound suppressor and includes a standard thread protector. Additionally, the 13½-inch Noveske NSR handguard ensures the barrel is free-floating for shot-to-shot consistency, thereby resulting in improved accuracy.</p><p>The thin and ultra-light NSR has an uninterrupted, full-length M1913 Picatinny rail on top, and the KeyMod Modular Direct Attachment System-jointly developed by Noveske and <a href="http://www.vltor.com/" target="_blank">VLTOR</a>-provides an easy and secure interface for installing additional rail sections on the handguard. It is secured to the upper receiver with a steel barrel nut.</p><p>The Modular Upper Receiver (MUR), is manufactured by VLTOR from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging and has noticeably thicker sidewalls that create a more stable and rigid platform for improved accuracy and durability. It also features an anti-rotation handguard interface.</p><p>The Noveske forged lower receiver features a mil-spec buffer tube and standard AR controls with the exception of the Noveske Short Throw Safety (STS) selector, which affords a 60 degree rotation from the safe to fire position rather than the standard 90-degree rotation of a conventional AR. It features stainless-steel construction with ambidextrous <a href="http://www.magpul.com/" target="_blank">Magpul</a> polymer SSG levers for smooth operation and user comfort.</p><p>Internally, the Nosler Varmageddon features a bolt carrier that provides greater weight for more secure lockup. The bolt has been shot-peened and magnetic-particle-inspected. The former provides compressive stress to the bolt surface, increasing metal fatigue resistance. Magnetic particle (MP) testing uses a magnetic field to detect any imperfections in the surface or subsurface of the part.</p><p>As befitting a precision rifle, the Varmageddon also features a precision trigger, in this case the <a href="http://geissele.com/index.aspx" target="_blank">Geissele</a> Super Dynamic-Enhanced. The blade of the two-stage unit has a flat surface that provides outstanding feel and a crisp 4-pound pull with zero creep or overtravel. The BCM GUNFIGHTER charging handle makes one-handed operation of the action a simple affair and provides convenient and easy access to the charging handle with a mounted optic. Aluminum folding backup iron sights from <a href="http://troyind.com/" target="_blank">Troy Industries</a> are standard.</p><p>Instead of the standard grip, Nosler has added the Magpul MOE version that features better ergonomics, improved comfort and internal storage space for spare parts or batteries. The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) stock is also a distinct upgrade that befits a true varmint rifle. The rifle-length stock does not collapse but does feature machined aluminum adjustment knobs that solidly maintain position under recoil and can extend length of pull by 1 inch and raise the comb height by up to ¾ inch.</p><p>The complete rifle package tested here also includes a signature Leupold VX3 LR Varmageddon branded 4.5-14x50 mm scope with a pre-calibrated Custom Dial System (CDS) matched to Nosler’s Varmageddon .223 Rem. 55-grain flat-base soft-point ammunition.</p><p>On the range the Varmageddon rifle package performed as expected with no malfunctions and, despite its almost 10-pound unloaded weight, it was well balanced and handled easily. In testing for accuracy at 100 yards from a sandbag rest the rifle showed its sub-m.o.a. potential with a variety of premium ammunition.</p><p>Fit and finish of the rifle were outstanding, and custom logos abound including the Varmageddon branding on the Leupold scope and on the right side of the lower receiver. Many extras, such as a soft-sided rifle case, a Harris bipod, 20- and 30-round Magpul PMAGs and 40 rounds of Varmageddon .223 Rem 55-grain Tipped ammunition, are included in the package.</p><p>For more than half a century Nosler has been perfecting bullets and ammunition designed for extreme accuracy and terminal ballistics. The Varmageddon represents the next step and establishes a perfect collaboration that delivers excellent out-of-the-box performance.</p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Nosler, Inc.; (800) 285-3701; varmageddon.com<strong></p><p>Caliber:</strong> 5.56x45 mm NATO (.223 Rem.)<strong></p><p>Action Type:</strong> direct-gas-impingement, semi-automatic center-fire rifle</p><p><strong>Receiver:</strong> 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum</p><p><strong>Barrel:</strong> 18" stainless steel</p><p><strong>Rifling:</strong> three-groove, 1:8" RH twist</p><p><strong>Magazine:</strong> 20- and 30-round detachable box</p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> M1913 Picatinny Rail, MBUIS rear/front, Leupold VX3 Scope</p><p><strong>Trigger:</strong> two-stage; 4-lb., 1.2-oz. pull</p><p><strong>Stock:</strong> black polymer Magpul: length of pull, 131⁄2"; drop at heel, 13⁄4"; drop at comb, 13⁄4"</p><p><strong>Overall Length:</strong> 36.25"</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 9 lbs. 14.2 ozs.</p><p><strong>Accessories:</strong> extra magazine, bipod, case, sling, manual, two boxes ammunition</p><p><strong>Suggested Retail Price:</strong> $2,295 (rifle only); $3,195 (as tested)</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/NoslerVarrifle_Results.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-23312" title="NoslerVarrifle_Results" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/NoslerVarrifle_Results.jpg" alt="" width="644" height="352" /></a></p>]]></bodyContent>

At first glance, shooters will see the attributes that have become standard for many revolvers in this class, including the 17⁄8-inch barrel, U-notch rear and fixed front sights, and the double-action-only trigger configuration with a fully shrouded hammer. But Ruger has stepped away from the traditional single- or dual-metal revolver construction to incorporate the best characteristics that aluminum, stainless steel and modern polymers have to offer.</p><p>The upper frame and barrel sleeve of the LCR is forged from lightweight 7000-series aircraft-grade aluminum. It’s called a Monolithic Frame by Ruger because it is formed as a single unit instead of being pieced together as with other revolver designs. A 1714 stainless-steel barrel is threaded into and supported by the frame. Steel bushings are added to reinforce the area surrounding the center pin and firing pin. The six-shot stainless-steel cylinder is uniquely and deeply fluted for the dual benefits of reducing the weight of the revolver and the chances of its printing when carried concealed. The cylinder has been treated with an Ionbond Diamondblack coating for added durability and a matte-black finish.</p><p>The lower frame assembly, or fire-control housing, is where the LCR departs from typical revolver design. Instead of using steel or aluminum, it is constructed of glass-filled nylon, which is light, strong and resistant to the corrosive effects of perspiration. It also flexes a little during recoil to help reduce impact to the shooter’s hand. Inside the polymer frame, steel is used for critical moving parts such as the trigger and cylinder release button, which adds a little weight to the revolver, but increases its working life. The fire-control group can be locked to prevent the gun from firing by removing the grip and engaging the safety mechanism with the provided key.</p><p>Few pocket pistols can be deemed “fun” to practice with, especially short-barreled revolvers. The stout recoil and long trigger pull of most small wheelguns require that real dedication be applied to mastering shooting them well. The LCR-22MAG, however, proved to be an enjoyable exception to the rule. The overall fit and finish of the LCR-22MAG were excellent, with the cylinder snapping snuggly into place while remaining easy to swing out for reloading.</p><p>The sight system is rudimentary, which is common for similar revolvers, but certainly adequate to the task of close-range self-defense. The front sight is pinned into place to allow the owner to trade it out for a fiber-optic or night sight. The hand-filling rubber grip firmly seats the revolver into the shooting hand, which in turn creates a solid fulcrum for the long trigger pull. Although the trigger tipped the Lyman trigger gauge at more than 12 pounds, the patented friction-reducing cam makes the pull feel smoother and lighter than it measures. Because the trigger swings through the arch of travel without any hang-ups or stacking, it’s more intuitive to work with.</p><p>The LCR-22MAG was test-fired with a wide variety of ammunition, from practice-grade rounds to those specifically marketed for self-defense applications. They all fed and ejected without any problems. Reloading was made quick and easy using aluminum J2-22MAG speed loaders and loading blocks from <a href="http://5starfirearms.com/" target="_blank">5 Star Firearms</a>. There was a single failure to fire. Re-chambering the round so as to present a fresh section of the cartridge rim two more times demonstrated the problem lay with unequal priming compound distribution, not the firing pin.</p><p>The LCR was originally designed to be as comfortable to shoot as it is to carry. Designers worked to mitigate the stout kick produced by .38-cal. center-fire pistol ammunition. Because of that, the LCR-22MAG produced exceptionally mild levels of felt recoil using .22 WMR self-defense loads. This made accurate shot placement and quick follow-up shots easy. It should be noted though that the .22 WMR cartridge usually produces a loud report and bright muzzle flash from a short-barreled revolver. In other words, it has the bark of a big-bore revolver without biting the hand that feeds it.</p><p>While the .38 Spl. +P and .357 Mag. LCR models offer some of the best stopping power available in pocketable revolvers, the .22 Long Rifle version allows shooters to plink and practice with reduced-cost ammunition.</p><p>Ammunition companies such as <a href="http://www.hornady.com/" target="_blank">Hornady</a>, <a href="http://www.speer-ammo.com/" target="_blank">Speer</a> and <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester</a> have developed loads specifically designed for use in short-barrel revolvers such as the LCR. Although they are not as powerful as center-fire pistol cartridges, they produce energy levels comparable to those of the .32 ACP and .380 ACP cartridges when fired from pocket-size semi-automatic pistols. The reduced cost of rimfire ammunition encourages regular practice, and tames the kick for those who want, or need, a low-recoil self-defense handgun. The LCRs are easy to operate and light enough to carry in a pocket or purse. All of those factors make the LCR-22MAG an ideal addition to the Ruger family of handguns.</p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co., Inc.; (603) 865-2442; <a href="http://www.ruger.com/index.html" target="_blank">ruger.com</a><strong></p><p>Action:</strong> double-action-only rimfire revolver<strong></p><p>Caliber:</strong> .22 WMR<strong></p><p>Frame:</strong> aluminum/glass-filled nylon polymer<strong></p><p>Barrel:</strong> 17⁄8" stainless steel<strong></p><p>Rifling:</strong> six-groove. 1:9" RH twist<strong></p><p>Cylinder:</strong> six-round capacity<strong></p><p>Sights:</strong> pinned ramp front, U-notch rear<strong></p><p>Trigger:</strong> double-action; 12-lb. pull<strong></p><p>Grip:</strong> Hogue Tamer Monogrip<strong></p><p>Overall Length:</strong> 61⁄2"<strong></p><p>Height:</strong> 41⁄2"<strong></p><p>Width:</strong> 1¼"<strong></p><p>Weight:</strong> 16.6 ozs.<strong></p><p>Accessories:</strong> lock, soft case, owner’s manual<strong></p><p>Suggested Retail Price:</strong> $529</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Ruger22LCR_results1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-23335" title="Ruger22LCR_results" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Ruger22LCR_results1.jpg" alt="" width="644" height="370" /></a></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>The oldest cartridge design still in large-scale production today, the rimfire suffers the ill effects of creation in the pre-center-fire period. Weaknesses stem from the ignition source; brass in the rim area must be thin enough to ensure detonation of the priming compound contained within when struck by the firing pin. Reduced-thickness brass necessitates low-pressure loadings, which result in lackluster external and terminal ballistics. As such, early, large-caliber rimfire cartridges have faded into obscurity, only chamberings best suited to plinking and small-game hunting remain. Development of new rimfire cartridges in the past half-century, and the past two decades in particular, have mostly been .17-cal.-commonly termed “sub-caliber”-cartridges. Although offering downrange advantages over stalwarts, such as the <a title="Learn more about the .22 in The Impossible .22 Rimfire. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=14347&amp;cat=27&amp;sub=28" target="_blank">.22 Long Rifle</a>, relatively mild pressures have prevented new cartridges from escaping the rimfire ballistic realm-until now. Enter the .17 Winchester Super Magnum (.17 WSM).</p><p><strong>Rewriting The Rules</strong></p><p>“Winchester is constantly striving to push the envelope on delivering faster, more powerful products in all categories to give our customers the advantage in the field,” said Brad Criner, senior product manager for <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester Ammunition</a>. The .17 WSM delivers upon this statement, and then some; however, achieving such performance proved problematic.</p><p>“The initial concept was derived more than a dozen years ago, and in direct development on this cartridge for a little over three years” reported Criner. “It took that long for technology to be developed to build the robust case that could withstand the higher pressures needed to drive a .17-cal., 20-grain bullet 3,000 fps.”</p><p>What advancements were made to enable the creation of the 33,000-p.s.i. .17 WSM cartridge? “Until now, the higher pressures split necks and burst rims, preventing us from introducing a cartridge of this magnitude,” he said. “In recent years, we developed a proprietary process for building the necked-down .17 HMR cases to significantly improve case strength and functionality. The same technology allowed us to develop the .17 WSM.” For comparison sake, the SAAMI-set maximum average pressure (MAP) for the .17 HMR is 26,000 p.s.i.</p><p>Fortunately for Winchester, it already had a basis-albeit unconventional-to which it could apply insight garnered from the aforementioned project-.27-cal. Powder-Actuated Tool (P.A.T.) loads for the construction industry that the company had loaded since the 1960s. “Why reinvent the wheel?” said Criner. The case, modified to handle the increased pressure rating, held sufficient propellant to achieve the desired velocity.</p><p>Choosing the ideal bullet caliber/weight proved simple for Winchester. “The .17 cal. has a great ballistic coefficient (BC), fit within the envelope and offered the highest velocity,” explained Criner. “We achieved our 3,000-fps goal and then some. We are safely hitting that number and could possibly get a little more but 3,000 fps allowed us to check the box on exceeding the ballistic performance of any rimfire magnum and approach center-fire ballistics (we actually exceed the ballistics of the .22 Hornet).” Thus far, Winchester has three bullet options: 20-grain red polymer tip (V-Max), 20-grain hollow-point and 25-grain polymer tip (gray), the latter of which has a factory-touted velocity of 2,600 fps.</p><p>Why not .20 caliber? Even if Hornady’s ultra-lightweight, 24-grain 0.204-inch-diameter NTX was used, the desired velocity for the cartridge could not be met; velocities would be similar to the 25-grain, .17-cal. polymer-tip load. The less-streamlined, light-for-caliber, .20-cal. bullets also exhibit notably lower BCs than .17-cal. projectiles of similar weight; the result is less energy downrange, as well as additional drop and wind deflection.</p><p>“That being said, we have not ruled out other ballistic possibilities in the future,” said Criner. “We are exploring options of different bullet calibers and other shell case calibers (P.A.T. is also loaded in 22- and 25-cal. shell cases).”</p><p>Performance in relation to cost determines a rimfire cartridge’s success and, ultimately, longevity; cite the .17 HMR (introduced in 2002) as an example of a widely accepted newer option, while the .17 Mach 2 (unveiled in 2004) is fading into obscurity-shooters are unwilling to pay a premium for the cartridge’s moderate ballistic advantages over the aged, yet immensely popular, .22 Long Rifle. Concerning downrange performance, as will be soon illustrated, the .17 WSM is on-par with center-fire cartridges; however, perusing <a href="http://www.midwayusa.com/" target="_blank">MidwayUSA’s website</a>, the three options range in price between $14 and $16.30 per 50. How is that possible?</p><p>“There are two primary drivers to the cost advantage of rimfire product versus a center-fire product,” reported Criner. “First, the primer is physically part of the rimfire case and does not need to be separate as is required for center-fire products. Secondly, the production process steps used in a rimfire are considerably less than those of a center-fire product, which includes multiple machining steps to create the intricate head and rim.”</p><p>What about availability? “We have ensured that the .17 WSM will be loaded on a regular basis in our magnum rotation,” he said.</p><p><strong>Breaking Down The Ballistics</strong></p><p>How does the .17 WSM “stack up” to its rimfire relatives and center-fire cousins? Despite its relatively petite size, with a maximum cartridge overall length of 1.590 inches and body diameter of 0.269 inches, the cartridge compares more favorably to the latter; however, any examination wouldn’t be complete without first contrasting it to the cartridge that enabled its existence, the .17 HMR.</p><p>Although not a true “apples-to-apples” comparison, due to the fact that the 20-grain V-Max loaded in the .17 HMR has a lower BC-.125-than that used in the .17 WSM (.185), with identical bullet weights, just assertions can be formulated. According to factory-published data, the .17 HMR propels the 20-grain V-Max to 2,550 fps, and with a 150-yard zero, the projectile impacts 1.7-inches high at 100 yards, 5-inches low at 200 yards, and 14.7-inches low at 250 yards. With a modest, 10-m.p.h. full-value wind, the bullet deflects off course 3.3 inches, 15.4 inches and 25.7 inches, respectively, at those same distances. Propelled to 3,000 fps from the .17 WSM, the more streamlined (and tougher, due to differing construction) 20-grain V-Max strikes 0.8-inches high at 100 yards, 2.5-inches low at 200 yards and 7-inches low at 250 yards. Deflection measurements are 1.6 inches, 8 inches and 13.6 inches <em>less</em> than those of the .17 HMR at the same distances. Considering the size of the game pursued, this is noteworthy.  Interestingly, despite its lower muzzle velocity, thanks to its higher BC (.230) the 25-grain polymer tip experiences slightly less wind deflection beyond 200 yards.</p><p>Equally important, the bullet from the .17 HMR reaches its lower threshold for expansion (about 1,400 fps) just beyond 175 yards, while that from the .17 WSM-upsetting down to 1,600 fps-works beyond 300 yards. With this, the .17 HMR’s heaviest bullet option is 20 grains, whereas the .17 WSM is available with a 25-grain projectile. Energy figures illustrate a consistent, 100 ft.-lb.-plus advantage out to 200 yards, and more than double the energy at 250 yards.</p><p>In actuality, the “more fair” comparison is between the .17 WSM and the relatively new .17 Hornet, a wildcat based upon the .22 Hornet legitimized by Hornady. Propelled to 3,650 fps from the .17 Hornet, the same 0.172-inch bullet as used in the .17 WSM hits 0.4-inches high at 100 yards, 1.5-inches low at 200 yards and 4.3-inches low at 250 yards. Wind deflection at those distances are 1.3 inches, 5.6 inches and 9.2 inches, respectively, or 0.4 inches, 1.8 inches and 2.9 inches less than the .17 WSM-a small advantage. Its bullet would expand at distances beyond 425 yards; however, 31.2-inches of wind deflection at said distance makes the argument irrelevant. Due to the significant “step-up” in velocity, downrange energy figures greatly favor the Hornet. The center-fire .17 Hornet does offer the benefit of reloadability, but .17 Hornet ammunition sells for between $18.50 and $20 per 25, so the end-user pays more and gets half the ammunition when compared to the .17 WSM-no small consideration for the high-volume shooter.</p><p>What about the popular .22 Hornet? With a 35-grain V-Max-with a BC of .109-at 3,100 fps, considering a 150-yard zero, the bullet impacts 1-inch high at 100 yards and 3.5-inches and 10.4-inches low at 200 yards and 250 yards, respectively-not too bad. Wind deflection is where this cartridge takes a turn for the worse; those measurements are 2.9 inches, 13.7 inches and 23.4 inches, which are inline with the .17 HMR and telling.</p><p>As for the .22 WMR, a just comparison cannot be made; it could be said that it’s not comparing “apples to oranges,” but rather “apples to durians,” and the external ballistics bear out the latter. Due to the projectiles’ blunt profiles-and resulting BCs-at distances beyond the 150-yard zero, wind deflection numbers are nearly double those for the .22 Hornet, thus negating the .22 WMR’s use at moderate ranges.</p><p>Just as important as external ballistics is accuracy. Last September, I had an opportunity to test prototype .17 WSM loads from a prototype B.Mag bolt-action in Illinois. That said, on the unusually calm day, three-shot groups with the 20-grain load (the only one on-hand) at 100 yards, 200 yards and 300 yards measured 0.266 inches, 1.33 inches and 1.83 inches respectively.</p><p>So, who is .17 WSM ideal for? The .17 HMR owner looking for more, the high-volume prairie dog shooter, the routine varminter? “All of the above,” said Criner. “This will take the rimfire guy out to 200 yards and beyond, and it will allow the center-fire guy to shoot more rounds at longer distances at a lower cost.”</p><p>After crunching the numbers with regard to external ballistics, and seeing its accuracy potential firsthand, Winchester has proven the rimfire platform is still relevant, if not ideal, for certain applications. The .17 WSM will fulfill the needs of varmint and predator hunters alike, negating center-fire necessity at distances within 250 yards, perhaps farther. Best of all, the increase of capabilities comes at cost consistent with existing “high-performance” rimfire cartridges. It’s a formula for success.</p><p>“When we saw the huge potential of this cartridge [.17 WSM]-substantially higher performance at only modestly higher price-it was an easy call,” explained Bill Dermody, director of marketing for <a href="http://www.savagearms.com/" target="_blank">Savage Arms</a>. “But, we didn’t just want to chamber the round; we wanted to make the rifle that would roll it out.” The rifle that emerged, the Bolt.Magnum, (B.Mag) took approximately 18 months to go from concept to completion. Why? The cartridge’s unusually high maximum average pressure (MAP), dimensions and construction created a quagmire for the company’s engineers.</p><p>Timing for the project was fortuitous; the company was already considering modernizing its rimfire line when approached by Winchester Ammunition. “We were working on a project to redesign what we call our ‘E-receiver,’ which is the foundation for our .22 Long Rifle, .22 WMR and .17 HMR rifles,” reported Dermody. “We wanted to make something more compact, with some updated features, such as a rotary magazine. At that point, we knew we’d have to backpedal somewhat to make the design suitable for the new cartridge.</p><p>We didn’t have a rimfire receiver designed for that kind of pressure-33,000 p.s.i. (.17 WSM) compared to 24,000 p.s.i. (.22 WMR) and 26,000 p.s.i. (.17 HMR)-and we didn’t want to ‘punt’ and chamber it in a center-fire gun such as a Model 25 or 110,” expounded Dermody. “So we just made a more robust rimfire system.” The key word here is “system,” as no single feature enables safe, reliable firing of the high-pressure cartridge in the scaled-down rifle.</p><p>First, the thick, yet malleable, brass of the cartridge’s rim-required due to the elevated pressure levels-mandates significant striking force be applied by the firing pin for trouble-free ignition-a feat the company’s previous designs could not accomplish. The answer: an atypical cock-on-close action. However, such a design had its detractions, too.</p><p>“The challenge isn’t hitting it hard enough,” explained Dermody. “The challenge is hitting it hard enough and still having a bolt that is easy for the shooter to operate. [Cock-on-close actions] provide more leverage, the benefits of which are realized whether shooting from the bench, prone or freehand.”</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SavageBMag.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-23346" title="SavageBMag" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SavageBMag-1024x327.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="186" /></a></p><p>On the sample B.Mag the force required to close the bolt measured 22 pounds-enough that some young or small-stature marksmen might have difficultly without applying direct pressure from above, while simultaneously snugly holding the rifle or resting it atop a solid object (such as a bench) or on the ground (in conjunction with a bipod). The unusual, non-functional design of the bolt knob-reminiscent of the original Browning T-Bolt, as created by Jack Donaldson-exacerbates the problem; a traditional, checkered round or, better yet, flat, knob would prove to be a superior choice.</p><p>The B.Mag has dual-opposed locking lugs at the bolt’s rear-another measure to counter the increased pressure. Further, the bolt face is deeply recessed, and the extractor is of a quasi Sako-style/hook-type configuration. Ejection is provided by a fixed ejector positioned behind the magazine. Lastly, the bolt shroud is uniquely contoured so as to afford unobstructed access to the two-position safety. The bolt-release button is located on the left rear of the receiver.</p><p>The petite receiver is of a new design, measuring 513⁄16 inches in length and 0.95 inches in width. Attached to the rear is a die-cast trigger housing containing an updated version of the AccuTrigger that enables pull weight adjustment without the removal of the barreled action from the stock and exclusive of special tools; simply turn a plastic dial to decrease or increase pull weight within the 2-pound, 8-ounce to 6-pound range. A mousetrap-type spring on the front face of the housing provides downward pressure on the magazine for easy removal. Forward of the magazine cutout is a dual-purpose polymer tab. First, it serves as a “catch,” with the rear side securing the magazine via a corresponding flat. The forward face ensures the polymer bottom unit is held in place. A circlip prevents the piece from falling off the threaded stud, which also acts as a recoil lug, and grooves in the receiver minimize side movement. Because the barrel is devoid of iron sights, the receiver is drilled and tapped for scope bases. According to Dermody, the B.Mag’s base configuration is unique; those for other Savage models will not work.</p><p>Attachment of the B.Mag’s barrel also differs from its rimfire brethren, mimicking that used on the company’s center-fire rifles. Immediately noticeable are three grooves near the receiver’s front. According to Dermody, “The barrel grooves disguise our headspacing system, as it needs a range of ‘adjustability’ to set the perfect headspace. On this rifle the threads are countersunk into the receiver so this ‘range’ in the threads is not exposed, but this leaves a visible gap between the barrel and receiver. We incorporated this gap into the design by enlarging it and adding two more. Additionally, the difference [between the traditional locking nut system and the B.Mag’s] is that there is a stud underneath that keeps the barrel from rotating, rather than a nut around the barrel.”</p><p>As for specifics, the slender, 22-inch free-floating steel barrel measures 0.860 inches at the receiver and tapers to 0.520 inches at the muzzle, where it ends in a radius crown. Because of the volume of propellant consumed, as well as a reduced bore diameter combined with high-velocity bullets, it is recommended that the button-rifled barrel be cleaned frequently. “If you let it get too dirty you could have extraction issues,” he explained. “These are easily resolved with a bore brush and a little solvent or even lube, however.</p><p>Everybody makes guns to be shot,” said Dermody. “The Savage way is to also design them to be manufactured. Accuracy always comes first, we’re Savage, that’s who we are. But manufacturability comes right after that.” Nowhere is ease of manufacture more apparent than on the B.Mag’s synthetic stock.</p><p>With the exception of stipple patterns and fore-end designs, the B.Mag’s stock closely follows the lines of the Axis. Like its center-fire predecessor, the B.Mag’s stock has a separate, one-piece bottom unit with integral trigger guard, which is easily removed without tools and hides the two action screws. “It keeps a slender profile, with no visible action screws,” emphasized Dermody. Strangely, though, when the detachable, eight-round-capacity rotary magazine is in place, there’s not only a 1/16-inch gap behind it, but the back portion of the cutout snags the hand, largely negating the bottom unit’s streamlined advantage. Finally, the stock is fitted with dual sling-swivel studs and capped with a ¼-inch-thick rubber recoil pad, which is appropriate for the chambering.</p><p>To conduct range evaluations, I topped the rifle with a <a href="http://redfield.com/" target="_blank">Redfield</a> Revenge 6-18X 44 mm riflescope in quick-detach rings on Weaver-style bases. Since the chambering’s ballistics are comparable to those of center-fire cartridges, I opted to test the rifle via five consecutive, five-shot groups at 100 yards. Currently, there are three ammunition choices from Winchester; however, the 20-grain hollow-point was unavailable, so both polymer tip loads-20- and 25-grain-were utilized. The rifle preferred the 25-grain polymer tip load, averaging 0.65 inches for 25 shots, and the smallest groups of which both measured 0.58 inches. Chronographing revealed both loads slightly exceeded factory-published numbers, averaging 3,019 fps for the 20-grain polymer-tip load, 2,621 fps for the 25-grain version.</p><p>During testing several observations were made. First, a high-velocity chambering, coupled with a slender barrel profile, results in rapid heating-especially in hot, summer-like temperatures. Secondly, being no fan of the magazine catch/release of the Axis rifle, it made sense that I’d have reservations about the B.Mag’s setup, which mimics it. Determining whether or not the magazine is secured is difficult, and one must double check to ensure it is properly seated. Several times during testing the magazine, which seemed in place, fell out during recoil.</p><p>When pushing the bolt forward from the rearmost position, as in chambering a round, it can easily be short stoked; once the bolt lugs are in alignment with the bolt handle cutout of the stock, the bolt handle can rotate downward. Doing so mars/dents the stock. Further, during testing, the sling swivel stud, which had a Versapod attached to it, fell completely out of the stock-not the best thing to have happen on a varmint rifle, as the gun is likely to have a bipod affixed to it.</p><p>The increased noise over other rimfire rounds is immediately noticeable; hearing protection is a must (and should be worn at all times when shooting anyway). As for the cock-on-close action, it posed no obstacle for me to operate; however, this might prove problematic for younger shooters, or those with less physical strength.</p><p>With the B.Mag, Savage Arms has created a platform to meet the unique center-fire-like demands of the .17 WSM cartridge, all while maintaining the scale of a traditional rimfire rifle and exhibiting the accuracy for which the company is renowned.

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>The producers of Top Shot sure seem to love the trick shots, as well as grouping the shooters into squads to force them to rely on the abilities of others. It almost seemed like prophecy when Kelly discussed how he had gone to the Proving Ground every time he had been grouped with others, but had never placed lower than second competing on his own.</p><p>Since last week's challenged ended the run of my other favorite, I sure was hoping I was wrong. Of course, I wasn’t really concerned because Kelly is good and has really dominated at the Proving Ground with whatever gun has been placed in his hands.</p><p>To be honest though, the competitors weren’t that impressive in the expedition shooting portion. Everybody was missing, with the extreme exception of Peter who nailed all three thrown soda cans to give his Blue squad the win, and since Gary was able to hit two cotton swabs at 25 feet, the Gray squad, consisting of Adam, Chris and Kelly, traveled to the Proving Ground. There Chris placed a bullet from a SIG P229 1.5 inches from the bullseye of the target 50 feet away. This, of course, meant that Adam and Kelly had to compete in the Elimination, but they didn’t seem too disappointed when they learned they would be competing with a Hotchkiss Mountain Gun that served in the 1902 Battle of Manila.</p><p>While Kelly seemed to do better during practice, under the pressure of the challenge, Adam was a little more consistent and continues his quest for $100,000 and the title of History’s Top Shot. Kelly was sent home, but he summed up his feelings with a single line: “I shot a freaking cannon.”</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>In the process of searching for an early reference to combat shooting techniques, I had cause to take down my copy of William L. Cassidy’s fine survey, Quick or Dead. This is a minor classic among handgunning books. Now 35 years old, it is still the best book to address the several schools of thought that have guided the development of close-quarters shooting over the years. Cassidy quotes from a great many different sources, among them a guy named Hugh Pollard.</p><p>Pollard was an Englishman who wrote in pre- and post-World War I times. In his major work, “The Book of the Pistol,” he has this cryptic advice for the combat handgunner who has just dropped a violent adversary: “Do not advance cheerfully upon your late opponent without reloading. You may have used your last round and he may not be properly dead and still spiteful.”</p><p>Properly dead?  Spiteful?  Indeed. Today’s <a href="http://www.gunsite.com/main/" target="_blank">Gunsite</a> says: “Load when you can, not when you have to.”</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Avoidance]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Of all the principles of self-defense, avoidance is the most important. By avoiding a conflict, we also avoid the potential legal and personal problems that may come with that conflict. Avoidance is so important that, even if you don't carry a defensive handgun, it should be part of your personal-defense plan.</p><p>By practicing awareness, a person can often spot potential trouble while there is still time to simply avoid it. Spotting the street punks while they are still a block away gives one time to cross to the other side of the street, or simply step into a place of business until the potential for trouble has passed. Leaving a place of business and spotting a stranger hanging around your car allows you to just go back into the business and ask for security or the police to check things out.</p><p>Without making social or racial judgments, a person will realize that it is just best to avoid certain parts of town, especially at night. You may have a favorite restaurant in that neighborhood, but visit it at lunchtime, not dinner time. Staying abreast of local news helps a citizen learn which parts of town have the highest rate of violent crime and those are the areas to avoid.</p><p>You should also be very selective of the night clubs that you patronize. Avoid a club where the rowdy crowd hangs out and, instead, select one that caters to folks who just want to unwind with their favorite beverage in a quiet, secure environment.</p><p>When out in public, you should also avoid looking like a victim. The person walking along staring at an iPhone is clearly oblivious to what is going on around him or her. The same is true of the person who plods along with his head down, avoiding eye contact. It is far better to walk erect and make eye contact with those around you. A pleasant smile will let others know that you have no aggressive intent. But the fact that you are alert, let's criminals know that you will probably be able to describe them to police and identify them in a line-up.</p><p>You should also make it a policy to avoid arguments, especially with strangers. Keeping your temper under control is critical to self-defense. Anger clouds the judgment and can cause you to do and say things that might aggravate the issue or, in the extreme, get yourself killed. This is not to say you shouldn't assert yourself, just do it in a calm, rational, even-tempered manner. More especially, be alert for rising anger in the person with which you are dealing. When you see indications of anger and increasing rage, just break off the conversation and get away if at all possible.</p><p>When dealing with a case of road rage, you should avoid angry looks and gestures. It is far better to yield right of way and let the angry driver go on his way. If he persists in following you, make some detours. And, if he continues to follow, make a detour by a police car or the police station.</p><p>You can also avoid making your home look like an easy target. Good outdoor lighting along with secure doors and windows make a home less appealing to crooks. And there is also great value in having a family dog that is not reluctant to sound the alarm when strangers come around.</p><p>Avoidance is the best method to get away from potential danger. A defensive handgun is merely an exit ticket for use when the way is blocked in a deadly manner. In the wake of a defensive shooting, your testimony and the evidence supporting it should be that you tried everything you could think of to avoid a deadly encounter. When all else failed, you used your defensive handgun to protect your life. If necessary, a criminal defense attorney should find that it is a case he can defend.</p><p>Avoidance is an intelligent part of the personal-defense plan, not a cowardly act. A person with strong avoidance skills will find that he seldom has to resort to using a defensive firearm, if at all. And that is a blessing.</p>]]></bodyContent>

The women got into a physical altercation and Burton was able to pin the woman against a wall. Burton told the woman that she had children in the home and that she needed to leave. The woman reportedly threatened the lives of Burton and her children, so Burton ran upstairs to grab her gun. She held the woman at gunpoint until police arrived.

He walked into Discount Gun Sales in Beaverton, Ore., with a baseball bat, reportedly smashing a display case and attempting to steal a firearm.

The gun shop manager held Mosley at gunpoint until the sheriff's department arrived. He was arrested and charged with first-degree robbery, first-degree theft, unlawful possession of a firearm and second-degree criminal mischief.

              <title><![CDATA[Conversions]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>The cap-and-ball revolver, sometimes referred to as the caplock revolver, had a fairly short service life. The first were made by Colt in Paterson, N.J., in 1836. Many other makers jumped on the bandwagon, but the dominant maker remained Colt, with Remington a close second.</p><p>The major handgun of the U.S. Civil War was the caplock, and both sides used them extensively, particularly in their cavalry regiments. After the War and as the frontiers moved westward, the caplock remained dominant until the early 1870s, when Colt introduced the first big center-fire Peacemakers. Within a few years, all makers produced the cartridge revolver as the service handgun of the future.</p><p>But metallic cartridges existed before there were revolvers to fire them. In the America of the 1860s, there were tens of thousands of fine, high-quality caplocks. It is not surprising that ingenious engineers found ways to convert the revolver that worked on the basis of percussion cap, loose powder and patched bullet (or ball), over to the use of self-contained metallic cartridges. It was a pivotal moment in the history of small arms and we are still working that way.</p><p>Usually, the conversions worked on basis of a new or modified cylinder. The better conversions had some kind of added extractor/ejector rod. For a few years in the late 1860s and early 1870s, many caplocks were converted to cartridge guns. Naturally, when factory-produced cartridge revolvers became available, the existing conversions were immediately second best.</p><p>It is amazing how the movie industry can sometimes get it so overwhelmingly right. In John Ford’s western classic “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,” Jimmy Stewart plays a transplanted Easterner who gets bullied into a gunfight with the title character. He is equipped with what appears to be a converted 1862 Police Model Colt, which is consistent with his status as a greenhorn who has not cut his teeth on the barrel of a Peacemaker. Perfect (gun) casting.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Six Carry Guns for Women]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Here are six recommendations for concealed-carry firearms for women as well as my reasoning for them. However, anyone considering carrying a firearm should also entertain these initial “six guidelines” as well, for in many cases, they will affect both gun choice and your method of carry. Choosing the right gun for your needs is obviously important, but clearly identifying and understanding your needs first is essential.</p><p><strong>1) </strong><strong>What activity will you be performing while carrying the gun? </strong>Walking? Driving? Running? Cycling? Something Else?</p><p><strong>2) </strong><strong>Where Are You Doing It? </strong>Home? Office? Public Places?</p><p><strong>3) </strong><strong>Who Are You Doing It With? </strong></p><p><strong>4) </strong><strong>What About The Environment? </strong>Not only the weather but: Indoors? Outdoors?</p><p><strong>5) </strong><strong>Your Body Type and Physical Abilities</strong></p><p>a) Frame Size, Height, Weight, Torso &amp; Arm Lengths, Breast Size, Hip-to-Waist-Diameter-Ratio</p><p>b) Hand Strength, Dexterity, Range of Motion, Previous Injuries, Overall Physical Fitness</p><p>c) Age</p><p><strong>6) </strong><strong>Clothing </strong></p><p>a) In most cases, your clothing will be dictated by all or some of the five items above.</p><p>b) Additionally, what you wear might be determined by personal preference as well</p><p>c) In either case, you have to think ahead about what you are wearing.</p><p><strong>Small-Frame Revolver</strong></p><p>1) .38 Special</p><p>2) .22 Magnum</p><p><strong>Small-Frame Pistol</strong></p><p>3) 9 mm</p><p>4) .380 ACP</p><p><strong>Compact Pistol</strong></p><p>5) .45 ACP</p><p>6) 9 mm</p><p>I also recommend the carrying of at least one extra magazine for any pistol and at least one <a href="http://bianchi-intl.com/product/Prod.php?TxtModelID=580"><strong>SpeedStrip</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.tuffproducts.com/home.php?cat=265"><strong>QuickStrip</strong></a> or <a href="http://www.safariland.com/DutyGear/duty/speedloaders.aspx"><strong>Speedloader</strong></a> for a revolver.</p><p>While one reads all kinds of articles these days about carrying big caliber and often high-capacity guns for personal defense, I tell people (male or female) to find something they are comfortable with in terms of fitting into their activities, mode(s) of dress <em>and</em> firing accurately under stress. Bigger is not always better. Finding something that you will always carry is best.</p><p>Major manufacturers such as <a href="http://www.taurususa.com/gun-selector-results.cfm?series=CC2&amp;toggle=tr"><strong>Taurus</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Category4_750001_750051_757768_-1_757767_757751_image"><strong>Smith &amp; Wesson</strong></a> are selling more small-frame revolvers than ever before because of their size, light weight and ease of operation. A <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product4_750001_750051_764961_-1_757768_757767_757751_ProductDisplayErrorView_Y"><strong>2” barrel, 5-shot, .38 Special, internal hammer, Double-Action-Only (DAO) revolver</strong></a> is convenient as well as highly effective. A <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product4_750001_750051_765779_-1_757768_757767_757751_ProductDisplayErrorView_Y"><strong>.357</strong></a> is better if one can handle the recoil but loading it with .38 Specials is often a better choice. The lack of a hammer spur makes it less likely to get snagged on the draw and it eliminates the unnecessary single-action (SA) thumb-cocking that is out of place on a gun used for personal defense in the kinds of deadly force altercations that require a firearm as a response.</p><p>If recoil is an issue even with the .38’s, a six shot .22 Magnum like the <a href="http://ruger.com/products/lcr/specSheets/5414.html"><strong>Ruger LCR</strong></a>, loaded with any of the newer rounds that employ a faster burning powder to take advantage of shorter barrels, is a viable option. I would never attempt to suggest that the .22 Magnum is at all within the same level of performance as any of the .38 Special rounds that are also designed for personal defense out of shorter barreled handguns, but for someone who is sensitive to the blast, flash or recoil of the .38 Spl, it can be a useful alternative.</p><p>Some men or women can have an issue with the .38 Special, and the .22 Magnum simply allows them to make use of the advantages that the small-frame revolver can offer to anyone with that problem--a problem that, by the way, affects very few people, as the .38 Special is generally a controllable cartridge in a gun like this.</p><p>For certain applications, body types and modes of dress, a magazine-fed pistol rather than a rotating-cylinder revolver might be a better choice. In today’s marketplace, extremely small and thin 9 mm pistols (“flat” is the term used most often) make use of our country’s military cartridge but in handgun formats that are easily carried and tucked out of sight, and in loadings that employ bullet designs that were all but unheard of until a few years ago. These true “mini-9’s” as offered by <a href="http://www.kimberamerica.com/solo"><strong>Kimber</strong></a>, <a href="http://ruger.com/products/lc9/specSheets/3200.html"><strong>Ruger</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product4_750001_750051_809560_-1_780153_757781_757781_ProductDisplayErrorView_Y"><strong>S&amp;W</strong></a> have represented a sea change in terms of serious performance in small packages, since they were introduced at the start of the current decade.</p><p>There is a bit more to learn when it comes to carrying a pistol instead of a revolver, but just saying that sounds scarier than it is and any more “work” (practice, actually) to become proficient with one is more than offset by its reduced bulk, improved ergonomics, pointability and ease of reloading. Again, when it comes to ammo sensitivity (and in this case, the possible need for something smaller still), a step downward to the .380 ACP cartridge finds extremely concealable pistols by companies like <a href="http://www.taurususa.com/gun-selector-results.cfm?series=738&amp;toggle=tp"><strong>Taurus</strong></a> and <a href="http://ruger.com/products/lc380/specSheets/3219.html"><strong>Ruger</strong></a> launching the same bullet diameter (albeit in a less powerful round) with a noticeable reduction in recoil.</p><p>Moving in the other direction for those who can handle it and whose clothing and activities allow it, there are intermediate size pistols (generally positioned in-between the mini-guns we have discussed, and what are normally considered to be full size, “service” or “duty” firearms) again in 9 mm but also in .45 ACP. These slightly larger guns are not for everybody because of their dimensions and, for some, because of the slightly higher recoil of the bigger diameter .45 ACP. But for those who want the larger bullets of that caliber or a greater number of the 9’s within their magazine, these long established “compact” pistols from such firms as <a href="http://us.glock.com/products/model/g19"><strong>Glock</strong></a>, <a href="http://sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/p239.aspx"><strong>Sig Sauer</strong></a> and <a href="http://springfield-armory.com/assets/pdf/SPRINGFIELD_Book_XD9645.pdf"><strong>Springfield Armory</strong></a> might do well.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Paired-up With Shotguns]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>With only eight shooters left in the house, Top Shot producers finally introduced a firearm that didn’t only fire a single projectile. For this episode, the even number of shooters was paired up in a Season Three favorite with a <a title="Read Mark Keefe's review of the Vinci. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/benelli-vinci/" target="_blank">Benelli Vinci</a> and <a href="http://www.benelliusa.com/" target="_blank">Benelli</a> M4.</p><p>Each pair had to hit a moving 8-inch steel plate with the M4, which released two clays that had to be dusted with the Vinci. In addition to accuracy, loading was a crucial aspect of this challenge, proven by Joe and Brian, who had issues keeping the shotguns charged, particularly the M4. Because of their low score, the pair was joined by Phil and Chris at the Proving Ground, where a new pistol was introduced for that challenge-the <a href="http://www.waltherarms.com/" target="_blank">Walther</a> P99.</p><p>The shot was taken at 50 feet, and once again Brian and Chris were spared the Elimination Challenge by placing holes that measured exactly the same distance from the bullseye. It was interesting to watch Chris pretty much resign himself to going home and then match one of the premier handgun shooters in the country.</p><p>It seems that now the field has shrunk, the producers are adding footage from the house to fulfill the show’s time requirement. It wasn’t too bad though, because the segments were more about the competitors eating and having a good time and was short on the drama that dominated previous seasons.</p><p>In the Elimination Challenge, Phil and Joe had to hit six targets on a spinner with the <a href="http://www.bowtecharchery.com/#/home?r=-1&amp;i=0" target="_blank">Bowtech</a> StrykeZone 380, and, once again, loading played an important factor. Joe just couldn’t figure out how to the crossbow smoothly, and even though Phil had some early accuracy problems, he obtained a nice lead and ended Joe’s time in the competition.</p><p>Next week’s episode should be really good, as they are bringing back the roundabout and the zip line to challenge the shooters’ skills. I am fascinated that the Elimination Challenges seem to be much more interesting, and am wondering how many shooters are a little jealous of their fellows battling it out in challenges I would love to try.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.berettausa.com" target="_blank">Beretta USA</a> has added 5-time Olympic medalist Kim Rhode to its competition shotgun team. Rhode won her first gold in 1996 at age 17 and a third gold medal in 2012, becoming the first American in any sport to win five consecutive medals. She hopes to continue this winning streak with the new team and a Beretta DT11.</p><p>"I'm thrilled to become part of the Beretta family," said Kim Rhode. "A love of shooting and the outdoors has been passed down for generations in my own family just like it has at Beretta for 500 years.

              <title><![CDATA[Diamondback DB15B AR-15 Rifle]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Located in Cocoa, Fla., <a href="http://diamondbackfirearms.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Diamondback Firearms LLC</a> made its way into the shooting market back in 2009 with a.380 ACP polymer pocket pistol called the DB380. It was soon followed by the DB9. Still in its infancy, Diamondback jumped into the competitive AR-15 market with the release of its DB15 series in 2012, and the timing couldn't have been better. At that time, the AR-15 style of rifle (or Modern Sporting Rifle if you prefer) was already securely anchored as one of the most popular rifles available. The recent political upheavals in relation to 2nd Amendment rights have caused these rifles to fly out the doors of gun dealers with even greater haste.</p><p>In becoming an AR-15 manufacturing company, Diamondback decided to launch its DB15 rifle series using the U.S. Military's tried and tested gas-impingement system. Diamondback also chose to deliver a product made entirely in the United States, using components machined in its CNC facility. The model used in this evaluation is the DB15B, with B indicating that the rifle sports a matte-black finish from head to toe. Other finish options include tan, camouflage and a nickel-boron.</p><p>Chambered in 5.56 NATO/.223 Rem., the rifles feature a 16-inch 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with a 1 in 9-inch twist rate. The free-floated barrel is threaded to accept muzzle accessories and arrives with an A2 flash hider installed. The upper and lower receivers are constructed of forged 7075 T6 aluminum, with the upper being of the A3 flat-top variety. The upper receiver's Picatinny rail meshes neatly with the milled in full-length top rail of Diamondback’s proprietary 8.75-inch aluminum one-piece hand guard, which extends over the gas block. The other three integral rails of the quad-rail accessory system are 2.25-inches long and located at the muzzle end of the hand guard.</p><p>The MilSpec 8620 bolt carrier is shot-peened and subjected to a magnetic particle inspection (MPI). A commercial-grade stock tube supports a six-position collapsible stock. Both the polymer stock and the A2-style pistol grip on this rifle are supplied by <a href="http://www.tapco.com/" target="_blank">TAPCO</a> with additional stock options available. The DB15B’s controls present no surprises. The magazine release, bolt release and charging handle are all standard AR-15 fare, shaped and located in the normal positions. This rifle arrived with one aluminum 30-round magazine.</p><p>At the shooting range, the DB15B nicely demonstrated the handling characteristics that make AR-15 carbines a popular shooting option. It successfully fed, fired and ejected test ammunition flawlessly using the provided magazine and some of <a href="http://www.brownells.com/" target="_blank">Brownell’s</a> aluminum after-market magazines. The trigger gauged at 7 pounds, 1 ounce, which is dead center of the typical factory 6 to 8-pound trigger pull weight. The curved, smooth-faced trigger was as comfortable to work with as a factory trigger can be.</p><p>The aluminum handguard is a little heavier than some, but once the rifle was shouldered it was not too noticeable. Diamondback deserves a pat on the back for not covering every single square inch of the hand guard with Picatinny railing. Instead, the company wisely limited the length of three lower rails. They're just long enough to add some gadgets while leaving plenty of smooth, hand-friendly space for holding the rifle with the support hand. It’s comfortable and functional instead of "Tacticool."</p><p>Two sighting options were tested with the DB15B, as the rifle comes without sights. For iron sights, the rifle was fitted with flip-up battle sights from <a href="http://xssights.com/" target="_blank">XS Sight Systems</a>. Teaming up with Troy Industries, which provides the Picatinny sight bases, the rear sight was fitted with the XS CSAT aperture. Designed by Paul Howe, the top of the CSAT rear sight is squared off and cut with a square notch, like a pistol sight, for engaging targets at close range. Below the square notch is the traditional small aperture for shooting out to 100 yards. The rear sight can be flipped to a large aperture as well. The front sight was topped with XS Sight's new 24/7 Tritium Stripe sight. It’s a .100-inch wide square-top post with a white stripe for daylight and half-light sight acquisition, and a <a href="http://www.trijicon.com/na_en/index.php" target="_blank">Trijicon</a> tritium lamp for low-light situations. During informal accuracy testing, this XS sight configuration proved to be accurate and easy to use. It only took a little practice to transition from close to distant targets using the CSAT aperture.</p><p>For formal accuracy testing, the XS sights were folded down and a <a href="http://www.leupold.com/" target="_blank">Leupold</a> VX-R Patrol 1.25-4x20 mm FireDot Special Purpose Reticle (SPR) scope was attached using a Mark 2 IMS scope mount. The VX-R features a fixed crosshair with a red dot at the center that can be adjusted for brightness. The combination of the fixed cross hair, the red dot and the adjustable magnification allows this scope to support most of the applications for which a combat carbine like the DB15B would be employed, including close-range defense and extended-range competition and target shooting. The quick-release base makes it easy to remove the scope if needed and keeps the zero when the scope is re-installed. Shooting five consecutive, five-shot groups from a bench rest at 100 yards, groups ranged from 1.5 inches to 2.25 inches in size. As expected, recoil was mild with all loads tested.</p><p>The fit and finish of the DB15B is top notch with all of the components coated properly. The tolerances are what you would expect to see from a new gun, with all of the controls running smoothly and the Picatinny rails cut properly to provide a secure fit for sights and accessories. The Diamondback handguard hits the mark in both the comfort and practical application departments. The DB15 arrives ready to shoot, once you have your preferred sight system in place. The Diamondback DB15B demonstrates all of the positive qualities most folks are looking for in a reasonably priced AR-15.</p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Diamondback Firearms LLC; <a href="http://diamondbackfirearms.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">diamondbackfirearms.com</a></p><p><strong>Model:</strong> DB15B (AR-15 Rifle)</p><p><strong>Action:</strong> Gas-impingement semi-auto</p><p><strong>Caliber:</strong> 5.56 NATO/.223 Remington</p><p><strong>Finish:</strong> Black Anodized hardcoat</p><p><strong>Barrel:</strong> 16-inches, 4140 chrome-moly, M4 contour, free floated</p><p><strong>Bolt Carrier:</strong> Shot-peened, magnetic particle inspected MilSpec 8620</p><p><strong>Lower Receiver:</strong> Forged 7075 T6 aluminum</p><p><strong>Upper Receiver:</strong> A3 flattop forged 7075 T6 aluminum, T-Marked</p><p><strong>Handguard</strong>: Diamondback aluminum modified four rail</p><p><strong>Pistol Grip:</strong> Tapco A2 style</p><p><strong>Stock:</strong> Tapco six-position collapsible stock</p><p><strong>Overall Length:</strong> Collapsed 32.5”; expanded  36.25”</p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 6.65 lbs.</p><p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 30+1 rounds</p><p><strong>Twist:</strong> 1:9” RH</p><p><strong>Accessories:</strong> One magazine, lock, owner’s manual</p><p><strong>Suggested Retail Price:</strong> $958</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DB15B_Results_s_web.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-23775" title="DB15B_Results_s_web" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DB15B_Results_s_web.jpg" alt="" width="644" height="449" /></a></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>While the majority of concealed-carry permit holders will never even draw a handgun to ward off an attacker, much less use it, there is always the chance that someday you will have to draw your handgun in a situation.</p><p>Hopefully that will end the confrontation, but if it doesn’t and shots are fired, the police will become involved to perform an investigation. But what should you do if the perpetrator skitters down the road, allowing you to holster and go on with life?  It’s pretty simple: You should call the police.</p><p>If your handgun leaves the holster while on the street, you should involve the police. Even if it is late, you’re tired and don’t really want to cause anyone trouble for a mistake, you should still call the police. If not, the police could be called on you.</p><p>Drawing a handgun can be considered brandishing, and even if the bad guy isn’t smart enough to try to get you back by reporting a “guy with a gun,” someone could witness the altercation, not understand what was happening and call the police on you. And if you casually walk over and get in your car, the person will probably obtain enough of your license plate for investigators to find you.</p><p>In every situation, you want to be the one explaining everything, rather than someone who was not involved and only understands part of the circumstances. This could very well protect you from having to defend against baseless charges, which can be expensive. So, if you draw your handgun in defense, the police should be notified to simply get your story on record.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>The stock number “S41045PD” is for an ammunition product from <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester</a>. While the company has offered what shooters need since the frontier days, this product is a first for the company. Intended for use in a revolver, Winchester have combined two different calibers in one box. It is a combo pack of 10 rounds of .410 shotgun shells and 10 rounds of .45 Colt cartridges, intended for the very popular Taurus Judge and S&amp;W Governor revolvers. Both rounds will fire in either gun and, at close ranges, the terminal effect is formidable.</p><p>A year or so back, I did a very detailed evaluation of special .410 loads for use in these unique new revolvers. After several shooting sessions, I was able to determine that this .410 load patterned better than all the others. It uses three solid “Defense Discs” atop 12 BB shot. The BBs tend to pattern around the point of impact of the discs. There’s also ten .45 Colt cartridges, in which we see 225-grain hollow points at 850 fps-a time tested recipe for stopping fights.</p><p>It’s very different packaging for special purpose ammo. Interestingly enough, the black, almost cubical box takes a typical twenty-hole styrofoam tray. Ten holes take the long .410 shotshells; the other ten are for the .45 Colt cartridges. Above the latter, there is a bit of extra space that the maker partitions off with folded bit of tagboard. Maybe even enough for a few rounds of .45 ACP; after all, the Governor is a triple-caliber defense revolver.</p><p>Some jurisdictions prohibit the possession and use of a shotgun/revolver, so check your local statutes before using one.</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Forget the Glamour Shots]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>We’ve all heard the advice to write down the make, model and serial number of firearms and to store the inventory in a separate and secure place. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives even has a <a href="http://www.atf.gov/files/publications/download/p/atf-p-3312-8.pdf" target="_blank">PDF form</a> you can download and use for free. And, by the way, a “secure” place isn’t necessary stored on your computer (or anything) that will probably disappear in the same heist.</p><p>Photos will help, too (especially with insurance claims), so I spent two full days taking images of guns, optics, weaponlights and even rangefinders after nearly becoming a <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blogs/break-in" target="_blank">victim</a> two weeks ago. That’s a lot of time behind the camera, making printouts and writing DVDs. Don’t get me wrong. It’s worth it and you should do the same, but you might as well learn from my mistakes.</p><p>First and foremost, don’t bother turning on your digital DSLR. These aren’t magazine-quality glamour shots. The above photo of a <a href="http://www.berettausa.com/products/px4-storm-type-f-sub-compact/">Beretta Px4 Storm</a> I took several years ago is a good example of what not to do. That image is not going to help law enforcement ID the gun during a bust or pawn shop inspection, nor will it provide a redundant record of the serial number.</p><p>I can’t believe I’m recommending this, but use your cell phone camera. Yes, they stink. You can’t even hold one steady in low light and sometimes the flash acts more like the whole-body scanner at an airport (which is oddly OK at the beach, but not in this case).</p><p>It’s up to you whether the photos stay on your phone. If they do, however, and they back up a moving van while you’re away you’ll have a complete record intact. Plug your phone into your computer, download them, burn them to DVD and place in a secure place the crooks won’t loot (like your limited-edition director’s cut of “Dirty Dancing” sleeve). Make another and leave it at a trusted friend or relative’s house, or even a safety-deposit box.</p><p>To me, taking the photos (which I’ve already begun) with absolutely no control over exposure is like working in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBV9WkfZdvw&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">cubicle</a>-no matter how hard you try, you’re only going to be frustrated with the results and everyone gets to watch. Get over it. All you need is documentation for insurance if applicable, and law enforcement.</p><p>Here’s how I began, but I’m sure others will have some better ideas. First I scored two big pieces of white poster board from a craft store. I always have some white Styrofoam hanging around, too, and place it next to guns to reflect light into those dark corners.</p><p>Find a shady spot in your yard or garage and lay the poster board down, end to end (long enough for your long arms, hopefully). If the nosy lady with the Pekinese next door is home, don’t go outside. Then, lay the first gun down (check and double check to make sure all are unloaded) and take a full-length photo. If it’s too dark, force the flash on (exactly how varies by cell phone), which is what I had to do with my dark blue or polymer handguns.</p><p>Next, get a magazine or newspaper with a recent publication date and place it on the poster board. Now, move the gun so the serial number is visible and close to that date. Make sure the serial number can be read easily, so take a nice close-up. On darker guns you may need to place a flashlight next to it to increase contrast and visibility. If you don’t have a bill of sale, that photo leaves no doubt as to your possession of the firearm on that date (or thereabouts). Metadata carried by the image will confirm, but when a law enforcement officer arrives he or she is not going to waste time as you tear apart photo data on your computer, which is probably gone, anyway.</p><p>The image of the gun and date will not be as ironclad as a receipt, but if there’s any claim by the “new owner” that his purchase was lawful prior to that date, you’ll have evidence otherwise. It’s just an added layer of protection for family heirlooms whose receipts are probably long gone.</p><p>Simply delete the ones that won’t work and continue shooting until you’re done. It’s not perfect, but it’s one less reason to curse the tiny, gutless, fuzzy and invasive cameras on cell phones that never seem to work on the beach, anyway.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/magazine-and-gun.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-23807" title="magazine-and-gun" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/magazine-and-gun.jpg" alt="" width="644" height="385" /></a></p>]]></bodyContent>

              <title><![CDATA[Glock Gen4 G20 10 mm Pistol]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>In 1983, the 10 mm semi-auto pistol cartridge made its debut. Developed by Jeff Cooper as a more powerful man stopper, the new cartridge was originally paired with the "Bren 10" pistol designed by Michael Dixon and Thomas Dornaus. Both the cartridge and the handgun generated plenty of excitement in the shooting community at the time. Unfortunately, the Bren 10 ran into production problems that limited it to a small 1,500 unit run of between 1983 to 1986. Despite the failure of the first pistol chambered for the potent 10 mm, the enthusiasm for the cartridge was still strong enough to induce <a href="http://us.glock.com/" target="_blank">Glock</a> to step in and develop a shooting solution based on its pistol design.</p><p>The Glock Model 20 was developed in 1990, with an official launch in 1991. Since its inception, Glock has been dedicated to producing reliable semi-auto pistols, primarily for law enforcement and military applications, thus the G20 was a full-size duty sidearm designed with uniformed personnel in mind. At the same time, the company recognized civilian shooters would find additional applications for this potent pistol and cartridge combination. They advertized the G20 as a "Perfect 10," for safe, reliable handgun hunting.</p><p>So where does the 10 mm fit on the handgun hunting scale? It's helpful to compare it to two other readily available cartridges that are often employed for hunting and defense against wild animals, namely, the .357 Mag. and .44 Mag. revolver cartridges. The 10 mm has a <a href="http://www.saami.org/index.cfm" target="_blank">S.A.A.M.I.</a> maximum pressure rating of 37,500 psi. The .357 tops out at 35,000 psi with the .44 Mag. rating 36,000 psi. The bullet diameter of the 10 mm is 0.400 inches, splitting the difference between the .357’s. 0.357-inch bullet and .44’s 0.429-inch bullet.</p><p>Common 10 mm bullet weights range from 135 to 200 grains, with some companies offering heavy hunting bullets weighing 220 or 230 grains. The common .357 bullet weights range from 110 to 180 grains, while the .44 Mag. retains the title of heavy-weight champion with bullets usually ranging from 180 grains to over 300 grains. Velocity and energy levels vary greatly between these three cartridges depending on the bullet weight, action type and barrel length. But from the G20's 4.61-inch barrel, commercially loaded 180-grain 10 mm cartridges can yield velocities around 1,300 fps with about 675 ft.-lbs. of energy at the muzzle. This energy level is in line with a 180-grain .357 Mag. cartridge fired from a 4-inch revolver. If hunters want to boost the power of the G20 a bit more, drop-in, factory-manufactured 6-inch barrels are available from Glock and third party vendors, such as <a href="http://www.lonewolfdist.com/" target="_blank">Lone Wolf Distributors</a> and <a href="http://www.kkmprecision.com/" target="_blank">KKM Precision</a>.</p><p>In the two decades since the G20 was released, Glock pistols and the 10 mm cartridge have moved in different directions. Glock has continued to grow as a leading gun manufacturer, with other gun companies adapting and applying Glock design principles to their own products. The 10 mm, on the other hand, has remained on the shooting sidelines. Although this cartridge has a loyal following, and several ammunition manufacturers provide 10 mm loads, it just hasn't caught on to become a mainstream offering. While some companies offer 10 mm pistols from time to time, Glock is one of the few pistol manufacturers to keep 10 mm pistols, including the full-size G20 and the subcompact G29, in regular production.</p><p>In order to handle the 10 mm cartridge's increased length and pressure levels, the G20 is about 0.10-inches wider and 0.13-inches longer than most of the other Gen4 duty-size Glocks, including the G17 and G22 (the G21 chambered in .45 ACP uses the same frame as the G20). The polymer frame keeps the unloaded weight to a reasonable 27.51 ounces. The gas-nitrate-treated steel slide is topped with polymer fixed sights, and the 4.61-inch barrel contains hexagonal rifling.</p><p>The extractor has a small, square extension that acts as a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator, making it easy to check with the tip of the trigger finger (or thumb for left-handed shooters). Other safety features include a trigger safety, firing pin safety and a drop safety. The G20's polymer frame is molded with a Picatinny compatible accessory rail. Because this is a full-size pistol frame, the rail is long enough to accept a variety of light and laser modules.</p><p>The third-generation, single-recoil spring, supported by a polymer guide rod, has been replaced by a fourth-generation, dual-recoil spring assembly with steel supports in key locations. The other Gen4 updates revolve around changes to the frame. These include a Rough Texture Frame grip surface, an enlarged magazine release and interchangeable backstraps. The Gen4 grip features the same dimensions as the Short Frame (SF) version, which makes this beefy pistol more accessible to shooters with small hands. Installing the thinnest backstrap takes the grip back to the standard dimensions, with the thicker backstrap adding an extra 0.08 inches to accommodate shooters with larger hands.</p><p>At the shooting range, I was expecting the G20 to provide a bit of a work out, as other 10 mm pistols I've shot have been bold in expressing their level of felt recoil. The subcompact G29, for example, can be a handful. However, this pistol turned out to be surprisingly comfortable to shoot. The G20 kept even the hottest loads at a workable level of recoil. The trigger felt like a factory standard trigger, with the pull measuring one ounce over the published weight of 5 pounds, 8 ounces. The factory sights are certainly functional, but there are better options out there for those looking to use the G20 as a hunting gun.</p><p>Accuracy testing was conducted from a bench rest using five, five-shot groups fired into targets set at 25 yards. Some readers will be quick to notice one of the rounds used for formal accuracy testing was loaded with hard-cast, gas-checked lead bullets. Glock warns against the use of soft-lead bullets in its factory barrels. This is because soft-lead bullets have been known to foul the rifling, which could in turn increase the pressures inside the barrel to an unsafe level. However, true hard-cast bullets, when properly lubricated, will not cause the problems of soft-lead bullets. That's why ammunition companies like <a href="https://www.buffalobore.com/" target="_blank">Buffalo Bore</a>, <a href="http://www.doubletapammo.com/php/catalog/index.php" target="_blank">DoubleTap</a> and <a href="http://www.underwoodammo.com/" target="_blank">Underwood Ammo</a> provide hard-cast hunting rounds for use in polygonal rifling pistols like the Glock.</p><p>The accuracy of this pistol and ammunition combination was excellent. It's good to see full-size production pistols keep shot groups hovering around the 3-inch mark during formal testing. When target groups stay consistently under 3 inches, that's a positive sign. The tightest five-shot group size of the test was 2.25 inches, produced by both the DoubleTap 230-grain WFNGC Hardcast round and the <a href="http://hprammo.com/" target="_blank">HPR</a> HyperClean 180-grain jacketed hollow point. The DoubleTap load produced the best five-shot group average of 2.4 inches, followed by the HPR round at 2.5 inches and <a href="http://www.federalpremium.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Federal's</a> American Eagle 180-grain full metal jacket at 2.6 inches.</p><p>In looking at the G20 as an outdoor adventure or hunting pistol, it seemed logical to carry it in a holster designed to fit that role. While hip holsters are useful most of the time, they can become uncomfortable or get in the way when riding ATVs, sitting in blinds or walking all day. A practical and comfortable solution to the problem was one of the high-quality Tanker holsters provided by <a href="http://www.epsaddlery.com/" target="_blank">El Paso Saddlery</a>. This bandoleer-supported holster was developed during World War II for air crews and tank operators who needed a way to carry pistols while moving in and out of vehicles and tight spaces. The holster supports the pistol midway between the hip and center of the chest, just above the belt line. It's easy to put on and take off, rides comfortably under a warm jacket and won’t interfere with shouldering a rifle or wearing a back pack. El Paso Saddlery has done a terrific job of updating this old design to work with modern, large-frame pistols.</p><p>For those shooters who are fans of full-size and big-bore handguns, the G20 is a marriage made in heaven. The flat-shooting 10 mm is among the most powerful of the common semi-auto pistol cartridges, providing Magnum-level stopping power for personal protection and hunting. The Glock pistol design is simple, rugged, reliable and can handle the increased pressure levels of the 10 mm cartridge with alacrity.</p><p>Of the 10 mm pistols I've had the opportunity to work with, the G20 is the softest shooting. The accuracy is excellent, especially for an out-of-the-box service pistol. The new Gen4 version G20 is more comfortable to work with for smaller hands than the Gen3 because of the reduced grip size, grip texturing and the enlarged magazine release. As one of those shooters who enjoys handguns with plenty of power, this version of the G20 has earned itself a place on my list of favorite gun tests of the year.</p><p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Glock; <a href="http://us.glock.com/" target="_blank">us.glock.com</a></p><p><strong>Model:</strong> Gen4 G20</p><p><strong>Action:</strong> Safe Action</p><p><strong>Caliber:</strong> 10 mm</p><p><strong>Finish:</strong> Gas nitrate</p><p><strong>Grips:</strong> Multiple backstrap system</p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> Fixed</p><p><strong>Barrel Length:</strong> 4.61”</p><p><strong>Overall Length:</strong> 7.6”</p><p><strong>Height:</strong> 5.47”</p><p><strong>Width:</strong> 1.28”</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 27.51 ozs., unloaded</p><p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 15+1 Rounds</p><p><strong>Twist:</strong> 1:9.84” RH</p><p><strong>Accessories:</strong> Three magazines, two backstraps with exchange tool &amp; pin, magazine loader, cleaning brush, hard case, lock, owner's manual</p><p><strong>Suggested Retail Price:</strong> $687</p>]]></bodyContent>

              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>It was around 10:30 p.m. when Matt Fugate heard a commotion from inside his home. When Fugate ran to investigate, he found two men assaulting his brother, John Fugate. One of the suspects was reportedly brandishing what turned out to be a pellet gun. When Fugate saw his brother in danger, he did not hesitate to take action, "I raced for the gun vault and had my gun in my hand in five seconds, …" he explained. Fugate ordered the intruders not to move and to keep their hands up. While Fugate held the intruders at gun-point, his brother was able to call the police. There were no serious injuries reported. Matt Fugate later commented on the ordeal, "I was scared and angry … I'm relieved that nothing bad came of it … that it ended the way it did, peacefully."

Police say the husband shot the abductors after the robbery, killing one and wounding the other. According to the police statement, two men allegedly held the victims at gunpoint in their home on August 1. They were bound and transported to the bank where the wife worked. The suspects returned to the house and made the husband drive them south in his truck, where he managed to get his personal firearms and shoot both suspects. He then called 911.

              <title><![CDATA[Summertime Concealed Carry]]></title>
              <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>In the 1988 film “Biloxi Blues,” a young World War II Army recruit played by Matthew Broderick is going through summertime training in Mississippi. Being from New York City, he is amazed by the temperature. “Man it's hot. It's like Africa hot. Tarzan couldn't take this kind of hot.” Of course Tarzan deals with the heat by wearing a loincloth, which would likely make any sort of concealed carry problematic.</p><p>The fact remains that when the mercury rises, sane people adapt their clothing choices. Most of us probably aren’t going the loincloth route, but shorts and a T-shirt seem reasonable. The thing to consider is that the gun-and-holster combination you were used to carrying while wearing a jacket, suit or sweatshirt may not work with lighter attire.</p><p>I personally don’t care how hot it gets; going without a gun is not an option. There have been several occasions which found me without a gun during a time I very much wished I had one. Fortunately I came to no harm but was left with a distinct dislike for feeling helpless.</p><p>Fortunately, for those who live in the jurisdictions where a law-abiding citizen can carry, there are a lot of options when it comes to summertime carry. The priority is to keep your firearm concealed and avoid unwanted attention. Most of us already carry something smaller than a full-size handgun to help achieve this goal. Smaller handguns are not only easier to conceal but also weigh less and make carry a bit more comfortable.</p><p>If you are definitely going to be wearing less clothing, you may want to downsize your carry gun even more. Pocket pistols offer the maximum amount of concealability, especially the pocket .380s paired off with a suitable pocket holster. <a href="http://www.desantisholster.com/" target="_blank">DeSantis</a> and <a href="http://www.unclemikes.com/" target="_blank">Uncle Mike’s</a> make some good, solid pocket holsters in different sizes. The advantage to this type of holster is that you can grip your gun and prepare for a very fast draw if trouble seems likely without arousing any suspicion since it looks like you have your hands in your pocket.</p><p>And if you prefer something other than a .380 ACP pistol, for just a slight uptick in size, pocket pistols are available in larger calibers. Pocket holsters are not limited to semi-autos however, and there are several that will fit small frame revolvers as well. Some are also designed to accommodate guns with lasers attached. The squared-off design of pocket holsters prevents the gun shape from printing through pants material and, even if it does, it could be explained away as a wallet. Pocket holsters also all feature some type of tacky polymer or rubber material on the exterior so the holster stays in your pocket when the gun is drawn.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/summer_conceal_i.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-23838 alignright" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="summer_conceal_i" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/summer_conceal_i.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="265" /></a>If you prefer, you can use your standard waistband holster. Just make sure you have a light garment to keep it concealed-this may prove difficult or too hot to wear in the summer. One option I like for waistband carry that provides total concealment with no covering garment is the <a href="http://www.sneakypeteholsters.com/" target="_blank">Sneaky Pete Holsters</a> “Cell Phone” case. It has the appearance of a leather cell phone case but provides instant access to a small-size pistol.</p><p>Another popular option is to use an <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13295&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=26" target="_blank">inside-the-waistband (IWB) holster</a>. With the gun and holster riding inside the pants, only the grip of the gun is exposed, keeping it mostly concealed. The gun also rides much closer to the body, helping to prevent printing against clothing and revealing the gun. Still, it is advisable to wear a loose covering that is long enough to keep the gun concealed when you raise your arms or won’t print when you bend over.</p><p>Inside-the-waistband carry requires clothing a bit larger than normal. It is a good idea to purchase pants that have a slightly looser fit to accommodate for the room the gun takes up. Also required are loose covering garments such as button shirts or T-shirts one size larger. Several manufacturers sell short-sleeve button shirts with extra room and access flaps to provide for quick access.</p><p>The next decision is between tucked and untucked. In many settings, walking around with an untucked shirt is not appropriate, especially in professional settings. Fortunately many holster manufacturers have developed tuckable IWB holsters. These feature extended clips that leave a deep gap between the top of the clip that goes outside the belt and the bottom of the clip that attaches to the holster.</p><p>You can tuck your shirt over the gun and into the clip. From the outside all that is visible is the belt clip. Of course, manufacturers have also devised clips that fit between your pants and your belt, which exposes only the small portion that hooks onto the belt.</p><p>It may also be a good idea to wear an undershirt with waistband or IWB carry, as this will help keep sweat off your gun and help prevent chaffing. Some IWB holsters, such as those from Crossbreed have extended backings that protect the gun from you, and you from the gun, so you don’t have to wear an undershirt if you don’t want to.</p><p>Keep in mind that this is going to slow down your draw as you will need to pull your shirt out of your pants to access your gun. Re-holstering won’t be any easier, as you will need to find a discreet place where you can tuck your shirt back into your pants.</p><p>A bellyband holster, basically an elastic band with a pocket, is another option for deep concealment with crossdraw carry. You only have to undo a few buttons on your shirt to gain access, or rip them if in a hurry.</p><p>With most small-concealed carry guns, you end up sacrificing ammunition capacity for size and weight. This makes it all the more important to try and carry a spare magazine or speed strip for a revolver. Spare magazines and speed strips can be carried loose, but the preferable way is in a separate pocket away from keys, change and other junk. I prefer speed strips over speedloaders because they lay flat in my pocket and still provide a fast revolver reload. Several manufacturers also produce small single stack magazine holders for waistband carry. Since these are fairly innocuous it is less necessary to keep them concealed.</p><p>The truly prepared individual will need to keep gun and spare ammo concealed, and carry a cell phone to call for help, a pocket knife, a small high output flashlight and if possible some sort of self-defense spray. All of these items are available in smaller versions for summertime carry. Remember to stay cool and safe no matter what the weather.</p>]]></bodyContent>
