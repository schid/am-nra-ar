      <![CDATA[Designed to aid in transport and operation of a long gun, the Rhodesian Scout rifle sling from Andy’s Leather is made from high-quality bridle leather and available in black or brown.



A two-point sling, the Rhodesian incorporates a large loop for fore-end attachment that is size-adjustable thanks to neatly punched holes and a brass buckle.



When shooting, the non-trigger hand is inserted through the loop and the leather is tensioned between the fore-end sling swivel and the shooter’s tricep, creating a more stable offhand shooting position. Buttstock attachment is by a brass screw and threaded button. Price: $55.

      <![CDATA[<em>This article first appeared in <a href="http://www.secondcalldefense.org/self-defense-news" target="_blank">Self-Defense News</a> at <a href="secondcalldefense.org" target="_blank">Second Call Defense</a>.</em>



Whether for fun or business, traveling presents many challenges if you're transporting or carrying one or more firearms. The last thing you want is to have your trip interrupted by an unexpected detour to a local jail.



This is a quick guide with five simple tips and some reference material to help make your trip go smoothly. Remember, laws change regularly and while it doesn't seem fair, it's ultimately your responsibility to know and abide by current law.



<strong>Meet Federal firearm transportation guidelines</strong>

For the most part, Federal law is pretty straightforward. No federal permit is required. And the Firearms Owners' Protection Act (FOPA) shields you from local restrictions if you're transporting firearms for lawful purposes.



Under FOPA, notwithstanding any state or local law, a person is entitled to transport a firearm from any place where he or she may lawfully possess and carry such firearm to any other place where he or she may lawfully possess and carry it, if the firearm is unloaded and locked out of reach. In vehicles without a trunk, the unloaded firearm must be in a locked container other than the glove compartment or console. Ammunition that is either locked out of reach in the trunk or in a locked container other than the glove compartment or console is also covered.



Exceptions apply to those who are convicted felons; persons under indictment for felonies; adjudicated "mental defectives" or those who have been involuntarily committed to mental institutions; illegal drug users; illegal aliens and most nonimmigrant aliens; dishonorably discharged veterans; those who have renounced their U.S. citizenship; fugitives from justice; persons convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence; and persons subject to domestic violence restraining orders.

<strong>Abide by state and local gun laws</strong>

This is where things get a little tricky. Laws vary place-to-place, and if you do anything other than pass through a state, you must obey all local laws. This is especially true when you are carrying a loaded firearm in your vehicle or on your person



There's no shortcut here. You need to map out your trip state-by-state to be sure you stay legal during your trip.

BATFE's State Laws and Published Ordinances - Firearms, 2010-2011</a>-nitty gritty details of state laws, not for the feint of heart



<strong>Ask about restrictions at specific locations</strong>

This is pretty simple if you plan every stop in advance. It's just a matter of making a few phone calls and asking about any firearm restrictions. Unless you plan to disarm, you'll need to choose your lodging, camp sites, parks, etc. based on the answers you get.



<strong>Get a concealed carry license</strong>

If you don't have one, get one whether you plan to carry on your person or just have a firearm in your vehicle. In most places, this simplifies the laws that apply to you and make transportation and possession easier to do legally. If you're staying in a state where your home state license is not honored, get a non-resident license for that state or find a non-resident license that covers that state.

<strong>Drive carefully and obey the speed limit</strong>

While you should make a good-faith effort to do everything right, being a careful driver can help you avoid situations where you discover what you've done wrong. Nearly every time someone gets in trouble for violating a state or local law, it's related to a traffic stop. An officer pulls you over, discovers you have a gun, then finds a technical violation.

        <![CDATA[There is something called a “Preamble” that is written as the “first” rule of order regarding the Constitution.  A Preamble is always first, in front and is the “introduction” to what you are about to read. 

The Constitution Preamble is as follows:
“We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”

Most important is that the “ultimate” authority is the people and that it is the people with this authority that “ordain and establish” the Constitution.  It is not the President, Congressional House, the Senate or any other elected politician.

Furthermore, there is “only” one possible way for anyone to work in “any” political office.  It is not their education or experience in any field.  They “must” swear an oath to obey the U.S. Constitution.  If they do not take the oath then they do not get into office.  So, the first step in any political career is the sworn oath and testimony that the American citizen is the final and ultimate authority.

The word “amendment” is defined as an alteration or correction to the previous text - in this case the Constitution.  This is what defines what the “Bill of Rights” are - also known as the first 10 Amendments.

[[]Remember - the Amendments are Rights guaranteed to American citizens, who are the ultimate authority, and acknowledged under oath by all public servants]

2nd Amendment: 
“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” 

1. “A well regulated Militia,” [=] the subject.
2. Comma leads to a modifier/qualifier for previous subject “or” adds another subject.
3. “being necessary to the security of a free State,” [=] the modifier or qualifier.
4. Comma leads to a modifier/qualifier for previous subject “or” adds another subject.
5. “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,” [=] subject.
6. Comma leads to a modifier/qualifier for previous subject “or” adds another subject.
7. “shall not be infringed.” [=] the modifier or qualifier.
8. Period [=] end of statement.

Years ago I did some research into the original meaning by the Founding Fathers.  I used a modern dictionary along with a dictionary printed in 1778.  The definitions have not changed.

The American people have the right for a Militia [(]army[)] to protect them - Federal or State. The American people have the right to keep and bear arms “possess and carry” firearms.

Any firearm law that contradicts the Constitution automatically loses and is illegal - which is most if not all.

        <![CDATA[Yes, NYC, NY state, NJ, MD, DE and MA often are reported as ignoring FOPA, often this happens when an airline cancels a flight and your checked bags are given to your possession until te next flight out.  TSA calls the local police and you just became a felon.
Federal law is nowhere near strong enough protection, there are traps on Corps of Engineers land and water, the Gun Free School Zone provides an exception ONLY if your CCHL is issued by the state where the school is located, state reciprocity does not apply.  Little traps, where you don't expect them, Oklahome does not allow carrying a concealed handgun over 45 caliber, New Mexico doesn't allow a backup gun.
www.handgunlaw.us , the NRA-ILA website, all states now appear to have a dedicated website that has the state laws needed. This maybe the State AG, state police or dept of public safety.  Do your homework.
BTW an unpaid traffic ticket makes you a fugitive from justice when they write a bench warrant because you didn't pay the $50 seatbelt fine.

When the Bill of Rights was adopted and copied in 1959 when Alaska and Hawaii joined te Union, the Second Amendment had only ONE COMMA.
Also few understand the word 'keep.'  British law in 1775 required storage of larger quantities of ARMS to be kept in armories where it coud be controlled and confiscated easily.  April 19, 1775 the British Army marched out of occupied Boston to confiscate the powder, lead, flints and swords as well as muskets and cannon at Concord & Lexington.  The Minutemen knew that was a surrender of fight notice.  When the Bill of Rights was written a few years later, the right to keep and bear arms was guaranteed  to prevent the new government from tripping that wire.
That is why gun control is so critical, they want total control and we don't want to give up our freedom.]]>

        <![CDATA[I believe this article is wrong on a serious level. FOPA [(]18 USC Chapter 44 § 926A[)] provides protection for interstate transport of firearms, but it makes no mention of affording protection for interstate transportation of ammunition. It only makes clear that if ammunition is being carried with a firearm that is too must not be directly accessible from the passenger compartment. The Definition section of Chapter 44 [(]§ 921[)] does not define a firearm as including ammunition.

The Act that allows retired law enforcement personnel to carry firearms interstate [(]18 USC Chapter 44 § 926C[)] specifically defines firearms as including ammunition, so those folks are okay.  
 
The glaring omission of ammunition transport protection in FOPA makes is impossible for someone who's neither a Massachusetts resident nor business owner to legally carry ammunition through Massachusetts, unless that person jumps through extremely onerous hoops to get a non-resident Massachusetts permit.

    <title>More on the Voluntary Recall of 3.3 XD-S in .45 ACP and 9 mm</title>

      <![CDATA[On Aug. 28 Springfield Armory initiated a <a href="http://www.springfieldrecall.com/" target="_blank">voluntary recall</a> that rubbed some gun bloggers the wrong way.  I’m not defending the company or indicting the critics, just warning you that doing a Google search will probably only confuse the issue if you own one of the affected handguns.



The notice explains, “Springfield has determined that under exceptionally rare circumstances, some 3.3 XD-S 9 mm and .45 ACP caliber pistols could experience an unintended discharge during the loading process when the slide is released, or could experience a double-fire<strong> </strong>when the trigger is pulled once. The chance of these conditions existing is exceptionally rare, but if they happen, serious injury or death could occur.”



There’s not much grey area in that statement, so take a look to see if your XD-S has a serial number that falls within the <a href="http://www.springfieldrecall.com/" target="_blank">recall range</a>. No injuries have been reported. The company’s popular XD and <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/the-springfield-xd-m-525-review" target="_blank">XD(M)</a>s are not affected.



I’m a big fan of Springfield Armory and its products. That makes my opinion somewhat jaded, but I like the way the company moved early, fast and often. OK, not often. According to one blogger a customer-service rep at Springfield said this is their first recall. That’s a pretty amazing record in itself.



I have an <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=14885&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=21">XD</a> in 9 mm and that thing refuses to choke, cough, sputter or even complain about my lack of maintenance. I wish I had two. The company makes great products, from utilitarian striker-fired handguns to the deadly reliable EMP too good looking to conceal. Reviews of the <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/recoil-management-springfields-9mm-luger-xd-s" target="_blank">XD-S</a> have been pretty sterling, as well.



Regardless how fast or slow Springfield Armory moved, though, many gun owners would complain. This industry’s safety record is enviable, and the manner in which the few recalls are handled reflects well on the professionals at each company’s helm.



Don’t take my word for it, though. Visit this government website dedicated to <a href="http://www.safercar.gov/">vehicular recalls</a>,  <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/default.htm">cosmetics</a>,  <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/default.htm">drugs</a> and even <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/RecallsOutbreaksEmergencies/default.htm">food</a>. Then of course there’s the Consumer Safety Product Commission <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/">page</a>, and probably 1,000 more, and in most cases I seriously doubt the company will pay shipping, and keep you up to date like Springfield Armory is doing every Friday on its <a href="http://www.springfieldrecall.com/Recall%20FAQ.asp" target="_blank"> FAQ</a>.



Gun owners have never had it better in regard to products, warranties and service. It’s easy to forget that sometimes.

        <![CDATA[The issue at hand is that when Springfield issued the recall, they were quoting a 4 week turnaround, which in turn made it sound as though they knew what the problem was, and how to fix it. It wasn't until 4 weeks later that they told us that they were still testing fixes, and upped the turnaround time. 

I'm glad the recalled the pistol, but I wish they had been a little more forthcoming with the information about the fix beforehand. <!--mobile-->]]>

        <![CDATA[Rules of safe gun handling say not to load your gun, drop the slide when it is pointed at anything you don't want to kill or destroy.  Thus no injuries. A gun doubling is a machinegun if BATFE hears about it.
The demand for guns makes the first 1,000-10,000 buyers product testers.
The factories don't make defective guns by choice.  My doctor just got his CCHL and I'll recommend he gets an XDs in 45 ACP, but he'll probably buy a 9mm.  He can afford more than one gun, I'll tell him to buy a SA 1911 too.]]>

I had 3 mags, took to a gunsmith and he said firing pin not striking primer hard enough. This not the only story just like mine. I ask Springfield if a gunsmith had taken it apart and they said no.. Now my XDs is being recalled ???.I'll staying with my   Glocks, S&W's Kimber's, Karh's, Sig's Ruger's . The xd's are awesome but Spingfield keeps snagging up. traded in Emp for a Sig 45 acp.

      <![CDATA[In 1994, <a href="http://www.advanced-armament.com/" target="_blank">Advanced Armament Corporation</a> arrived on the scene with the manufacture of state-of-the-art silencers. More than 13 years, later they continue to make some of the finest suppressors available. Now the company also has its hands in the ammunition and rifle business. One of AAC's first rifles is the latest AmericanRifleman.org Gun of the Week: The 300 AAC Blackout Model Seven.



Built by <a href="http://www.remington.com/" target="_blank">Remington</a> to AAC’s specifications around the smaller, Model 700 based Model Seven action, the rifle supports some of the same features as the standard Remington model seven, but it’s the differences that make it stand out.



You can learn all about AAC's take on the Model Seven in the video below, hosted by <a href="http://www.americanhunter.org" target="_blank"><em>American Hunter's</em></a> Jon Draper.



<strong>Technical Specifications:</strong>



<strong>Caliber:</strong> .300 AAC Blackout

<strong>Barrel Length:</strong> 16"

<strong>Weight:</strong> 6.5 lbs.

<strong>Trigger Pull:</strong> 3.5 lbs.

<strong>Twist:</strong> 7:1

<strong>MSRP:</strong> $899

      <comment_content><![CDATA[the scope is mounted high because it is on a 20 MOA mount, which gives you more elevation for long distance shooting. It is a better round than the 7.62 because it can be run under the speed of sound and with a suppressor makes almost no noise at all at subsonic speeds. ]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Yes, I think the choice of scope height was all about not jamming your knuckles against the scope when working the bolt. An easy thing to remedy with a set of lower scope rings which aren't too expensive, if desired. And good point that 7.62x39 is cheaper and more available, but a lot of good can still be said for 300 Blackout. For one thing, it cycles more reliably in a bolt gun's action vs. the more tapered 7.62x39 case, and the magazine can hold a few more extra rounds from its smaller case diameter. And its much more accurate too, specifically designed for American .308 bore diameters. For those reasons alone I'll take the 300 Blackout, though I too wince at the ammo cost nowadays. I've seen some recent 300 Blackout posts here in AR.org, lamenting how every time a new cartridge is introduced, its the best thing since apple pie, and yet the old 30-30 / 7.62x39 equivalents were always branded as borderline hunting cartridges!--lol. I say times have changed. All of these with modern bullet designs are more than adequate at typical hunting blind distances of less than 200yds, beyond which is a challenge to young hunters anyway. For a youth gun that dad can also enjoy and tinker with, occasional hunting rifle, looks like a very good gun. I'm for it.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I have one of these, and I had to do a lot of smoothing of feed ramp and magazine spring work to get it to feed .  It is a poorly made, unreliable design as it binds most ammo, including factory rounds.  Remington shows again that they are not interested in quality.  I also have a 300 BLK upper S&W and I have it running flawlessly with a variety of sub and supersonic ammo.  The Model 7 is really a single shot, if you can get the first one to feed.  Google the feeding problems, and you will see I am not alone.  The AR 300 upper was less than the Model seven also, and is just as accurate.]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[Well Lee, I don't own one, and can only sympathize for you. But if you don't mind my two cents, I'm a good amateur gunsmith and have an understanding of feeding problems in both ARs and bolt actions. I Googled this issue like you said, and found some posts on 300blktalk.forum of Model Seven owners having these same issues as yours. Interesting. The problem seems to lie in the spring slipping around in the magazine well, which can cause presentation angle problems. And  I also see two posts where AAC very quickly jumped on this, having great customer service, and now has a fix for it. It’s a shim placed in the floor plate, that keeps the spring position stable and consistent.  Very innovative. AAC was very responsive at fixing this initial teething problem for their customers, as it first arose. So that's the good news on it, and end of story. 
From my knowledge, bolt action feeding problems mostly stem from mag spring issues such as above, as well as feed rails in need of tweaking, to properly present the bullet for feeding. This is especially true of push feed bolt designs.
As far as feed ramp problems, my experience In AR platforms shows the same barrel extension feed ramp used in 5.56 ARs will not do, and must be modified when building a 300 Blackout upper. The feed ramp needs to more accommodate the wider bullet diameter and ogive of the 300 blackout, for proper guidance into the chamber. Then after that, and magazine lips also tweaked, feeding is flawless. And an easier problem to fix I might add, than trying to adapt a steeper shouldered 7.62x39 to feed in AR uppers. And this same feed ramp principle applies for your own Model Seven feed ramp. But your gun shouldn't leave the factory in need of this. Surely they're aware of this difference at AAC. Does your magazine have this shim in it?  I noticed that 2 of the above forum posters had feeding problems because they had built their 300 blackout guns from Remingtons of other calibers, and that's why they had to go through these same issues, and were in need of this shim. These guys don't count, as they didn’t' buy their guns stock from the Remington factory or AAC.
Well, at least AAC is very strong on support, and promptly addressing their customer issues with this quck fix. Bully for them. And you can see in the video, how the demo gun had no problems at all feeding an entire magazine of rounds. I'm sure it has this shim in it. So these feeding problems are not inherent, and were worked out as this new gun was introduced into the market. Then after that, no more problems in subsequent production guns. Hope this helps. [(]and No, I don't work for either company and am not a paid blogger[)]…

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Jason, I take it back about knuckle clearance, its not the driving factor in why the scope was mounted high after all, like I said below. After slo-mowing the video, the bolt's throw angle is adequate for clearing a scope mounted at any height. But Tom's right. See Sierra's reloading manual, or Google the concept of Maximum Point Blank Range [(]MPBR[)]. The high mounts are provided to maximize this relation of your scope height as your looking through it, to the bullet's path, which allows you to better keep your arc within say, a 12 inch circle, farther out there than if the scope were mounted lower on the gun. Staying within this MPBR, you know you don't have to hold over much, and can still make a clean hit on your quarry. A low mounted scope will exceed this 12 inch arc of travel at a closer range, than a scope mounted higher. A high mounted scope will extend your MPBR out maybe another 50 yards or so. So you need this, and the 20moa rail when playing with heavy bullets and subsonic loads, which drop like a rock out past 150 yards. This gun is truly maximized and well thought out to manage the 300 Blackout's flexibility of bullets. Add a good mildot reticle and a range finder, and you'll have all the tools needed to make an accurate shot with it at distance [(]judginng crosswinds are another matter[)].]]></comment_content>

      <![CDATA[The National Rifle Association has announced it has surpassed 800 exhibitors for the Great American Outdoor Show, Feb. 1-9, 2013, in Harrisburg, Pa. A combination of local and national vendors will fill the Hunting, Fishing, Archery, Camping and Boating halls along with the new Shooting Sports Hall.



“The Great American Outdoor Show has received a tremendous amount of interest from exhibitors throughout the country,” said NRA Shows &amp; Exhibits Managing Director Jeff Poole. “Removing many non-related product displays has allowed us to relocate and expand the popular Fishing and Archery Halls, plus add an entirely new Shooting Sports Hall.”

      <![CDATA[If you don’t own a Ruger 10/22 in at least one of its many configurations, someone needs to check your pulse. By 2011, when Ruger finally rolled out a <a href="http://www.ruger.com/news/2011-04-29b.html" target="_blank">25-round rotary magazine</a> for the rifle, the company estimated more than six million 10/22s were in gun safes, rifle racks and the hands of shooters worldwide. It was introduced in 1964, so some quick math determines that’s 127,659 of the carbines selling every year, 10,638 a month and somewhere around 354 a day.



To celebrate the classic’s 50th birthday the company is holding an <a href="http://www.ruger.com/micros/1022_50/index.html?r=y" target="_blank">Anniversary Design Contest</a>. If you have a 10/22 and haven’t at least thought about modifying it, you also need to check your pulse. Don’t get me wrong, the rimfire semi-automatic is great in its stock configuration, but it begs for a different stock, rails, scope, ghost rings or bipod. An entire cottage industry grew up around 10/22 aftermarket parts. Here’s a nice sample of what’s available right now from <a href="http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/Search.aspx?site=All+Products&amp;num=15&amp;q=Ruger+10%2f22&amp;fgb=t" target="_blank">Cheaper than Dirt</a> (Editors Note: Do not visit this page while at work. It will diminish productivity, generate verbal warnings, add trips to human resources, attract snickers from latte-sipping co-workers and soon you and your UPS delivery guy will be on a first-name basis, not that there’s anything wrong with that).



The contest is open now, but closes at noon (Eastern Time), Friday Oct. 18. To enter, submit a photo of your customized Ruger 10/22, along with a description and itemized parts list. The Grand Prize Winner will have his or her design used as the basis for a new, production 10/22. They will also receive one of the rifles, go to the Ruger plant in New Hampshire to watch the rifle being made and cement their relationship with UPS by receiving $5,000 worth of Ruger gear.



Nine other First Prize finishers will receive a Ruger firearm of their choice. Wait, there’s more. You can visit <a href="http://www.ruger.com/index.html" target="_blank">Ruger’s website</a> from Oct. 21 to Nov. 1 to vote for your favorite design among the top-10 finishers. The lawyers, of course, have to eat, so here are the <a href="https://www.ruger.com/dataProcess/1022_50/" target="_blank">official rules. </a>



It’s pretty awesome that Ruger is celebrating the birthday of the world’s most popular firearm by celebrating home-brewed modifications. Of course, how well you photograph the gun will have an impact. More on that in the next installment, but in the meantime, <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/ruger-10-22-hybrid-target-rifle" target="_blank">here’s a pretty cool target version</a> and <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/ruger-thompson-submachine-gun-conversion-kit" target="_blank">Thompson mod</a> over which to drool.]]>

      <![CDATA[At approximately 11 p.m., a resident responded to the sound of an intruder entering his home. A 21-year-old man had used a shovel to break through a back window and enter the residence. The resident retrieved a firearm and shot down a hallway toward the intruder. The intruder, who already had a long list of previous offenses, was struck and later pronounced dead. The homeowner was reportedly not injured during the home invasion. (<a href="http://www.postandcourier.com/" target="_blank">The Post &amp; Courier,</a> Orangeburg, S.C., 5/27/13)



Two armed men entered a Houston auto shop and car dealership demanding money. The owner, Mack Agaybi, saw the suspects on his security monitor in his office before they entered, and left the office with his gun to confront them. A brief gunfight followed, and the suspects fled the scene. Mack donated a $1,000 reward to help locate the suspects.

<strong>From The Armed Citizen Archives</strong>

<em>October 1983:</em> A would-be rapist awoke Claudine Hale in her Baltimore apartment, grabbed her by the throat and threatened to harm the children sleeping in the same room. Hale struggled with the assailant, then managed to reach a handgun, which she used to halt the attack. He fled after being shot, and a suspect was found dead nearby. Baltimore authorities declined to press charges against the woman. (<em>The Evening Sun</em>, Baltimore, Md.)]]>

why would the press charges against the victim?  Why would the paper even print a statement like that.

    <title>Taylor&#039;s Tactical Model 1892 Alaskan Take-Down</title>

      <![CDATA[Manufacturers of firearms, optics and accessories are, for good reason, increasingly modifying existing products to capitalize on the current desire for all things tactical and survival/sustenance-related. Even the Model 1892 lever-action rifle, which is among the most “traditional” of firearm designs, hasn’t escaped an overhaul to satiate the demand. Evaluated here is Taylor’s &amp; Company’s modernization of the Model 1892, the Alaskan Take-Down, which is distributed exclusively by Taylor’s Tactical. The rifle is produced in Italy by Chiappa and imported exclusively for Taylor’s &amp; Co.



The 1892 Alaskan Take-Down’s aesthetics and features are decidedly different than typically encountered on such rifles. Its receiver, barrel and large loop lever have a matte-chrome finish, while the hardwood stock and fore-end are covered with an overmolded rubber finish the company calls Softouch. Combined, it creates a utilitarian two-tone package that’s far from the time-honored combination of walnut and bluing, and even more durable.



Arguably, its most attractive feature is the fact it can be broken down into two separate parts that measure 20 inches in length or less for easy transport-no small consideration for those heading to the backcountry, regardless if on a bush plane or backpacking in. Thanks to some clever design features, no tools are required for takedown, either.



The procedure is simple. Check and double-check that the rifle is unloaded and leave the action open. Next, locate the 1.3-inch long, flush-fitting magazine-disassembly lever, which is at the front, bottom of the magazine tube. Grasp it on the end toward the receiver and rotate until perpendicular to the magazine. At the same time a lug will retreat from a recess under the barrel, a system that locks everything solidly in place while shooting.



Rotate the lever counter-clockwise to remove the magazine. Once it’s out, you can grasp the fore-end while firmly holding the stock, and turn counter-clockwise 90 degrees to separate the two. This is made possible by the interrupted thread pattern on the barrel and receiver. Damage to the magazine can be prevented by reinstalling it on the fore-end during storage.



Because both the front and rear sights are located on the barrel assembly, there is no point-of-impact shift resulting from the disassembly and reassembly process. The 1892 Alaskan Take-Down ships with windage- and elevation-adjustable Skinner Express sights at the rear. The test rifle had Skinner’s 0.125-inch (large) aperture installed, which is excellent for rapid target acquisition, but precision bullet placement at 100 yards and beyond is compromised. For the intended purposes of the .44 Rem. Mag.-chambered Take-Down-hunting/survival-it’s a fair trade-off; however, smaller apertures can be purchased from <a href="http://skinnersights.com" target="_blank">Skinner</a> for $11.



The dovetailed front sight has a 0.625-inch long, red fiber-optic pipe anchored in three places. The sight is slightly more than 0.4 inches above the barrel. In testing, target acquisition was fast, intuitive and even in low light the front sight was easy to find. To mount a scout-style optic, removal of the Skinner sight is required. It occupies two of the four threaded holes provided on the rifle designed to accept Weaver 61M mounts.



At the muzzle end, the 20-inch octagonal barrel-also available in a 16-inch version-has a diameter of 0.75 inches and ends with a radius crown. At the receiver the barrel widens to 0.84 inches. Both the barrel and the receiver had an even finish with no blemishes visible.



The buttstock was a different story. A trio of nicks in the Softouch finish resulting from rough handling in transit was deep enough to expose the hardwood underneath. The semi-tacky treatment was extremely effective on the hot, humid day when accuracy and function testing were conducted. Sling swivel studs were absent; however, they can easily be added thanks to the wood buttstock and fore-end.



With the 20-inch barrel, the rifle’s overall length is 38 inches; obviously the 16-inch barreled variant’s overall length is 4" shorter. Capping the buttstock is a generous 1/2-inch thick rubber recoil pad that contributes to the rifle’s 13¾-inch length of pull.



To load the magazine, cartridges are pushed through a gate on the right side of the receiver and empty brass is ejected from the top of the receiver-it’s a system familiar to Model 1892 fans. The oversized loop lever is a handy feature, especially whenever gloves are worn. Regardless of familiarity with lever-action operation, though, no one could miss the fact that this is the kind of trigger dreams are made of-no creep, no grit, and no takeup. All rifles should have one of these, and it broke cleanly and crisply at precisely 3 pounds with regularity.



During testing the only stoppage occurred due to operator error, a failure to work the lever with enough authority when chambering a single Federal cartridge. There were no other malfunctions.



Velocities produced by what is really handgun ammunition make the rifle a viable complement to a .44 Rem. Mag. revolver in bear country or survival situations. The Softouch finish does its job, and proper sight pictures are easy to acquire with that red glow up front. Most shooters will probably agree that nothing needs to be changed.



And our sample was a real shooter. In fact, in multiple instances three out of five holes touched at 50 yards. Moving back to 100 yards to meet American Rifleman protocol, however, the groups increased a bit. That being said, the most accurate load was Hornady’s 300-grain XTP. Its single best five-shot group measured 2.71 inches, and 25 shots averaged 4.32 inches. For 75 shots with three different loads the rifle averaged 4.69 inches. Given the use of open sights and the rifle’s chambering, we found this level of accuracy acceptable.



Anyone looking for a reliable lever gun to beat the brush for big game, backup for the backcountry, or to simply punch paper, won't go wrong with the 1892 Alaskan Take-Down.

        <![CDATA[Yes siree, it's a beauty alright!

But $1,300. Bones? I don't think so. 

Like Chris says, ' I can remember when a lever action rifle was affordable to the average hunter.'

Heck, you figure in the cost of ammunition [(]if you can find it[)] and that pretty much blows the fun out of ownership! 

That is unless you're one of those who find your pride in gloating over how much you paid for something.

Too bad, I'd love to own one.

        <![CDATA[Well guys, I want to begin by thanking all my fellow riflemen who take time to review firearms, show videos of their experiences, and share thoughts and instruction that is unavailable from the majority of people.
I spent the 1300. bones that it took to buy the Taylors & Co Alaskan takedown.  Yes its more money than you used to spend on these guns, but today most quality lever guns will run you 1000 $ or more.   No arguing that there are cheaper deals out there but I wanted to dance with the prettiest girl at the dance  :[)]
When I unboxed the rifle it was in fully assembled.   Take down was stiff as this puppy hadn't been oiled [(]first order of business[)].
Looking through the rear Skinner sight at the fiber optic front sight was a wow experience.  Again, this is a traditional 1892 mechanism that is a clear departure from tradition as a whole.  How much would you pay for the cool take-down factor.
I guarantee you that this is not going to be a Safe Queen.  The rubber over mold is hardly noticeable in use.  It probably will assist in gripping with hands or gloves.  It is a smooth Axe to swing around on target.  I cant wait to visit my brother and do some Hog busting in Texas.]]>

        <![CDATA[People who are concerned with the pricing need to understand that these are not off the shelf models.  These are completely rebuilt custom models.  Taylors does a lot of gunsmithing on the rifles for clean up and tune up.  
Compared to, say, WildWestGuns's copilot, which starts at $2,800, this rifle is actually relatively cheap.   Their conversion to take down for a lever action is $600 alone.  If you started with the rifle at $500, add the takedown at $600, add a trigger/action job at $250, you're already above the $1324 they're asking, before you go into the sights, stock upgrades, and refinish.  You can say 'I can't afford it' and that's fine, but to say 'It's not worth it' is not true.  It may not be what you want to spend for the rifle, but it's well worth the cost based on what you get. ]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I had a gun shop order one for me at $1140. Have no idea when it will be available, as they are all on order, and first come first served. It only comes in a 16' barrel for this .357 model, and I wish it had an 18-20' barrel. If you compare prices, a Marlin 1894C, .357 is $750-$800 new, If you can find one, and $900-$1000 used on line. Add in the cost of a takedown, skinner sights, smooth action large lever, and a perfect trigger, you get a complete out of the box ready rifle for $1140. That is a bargain to me.. I ordered .357 because I have a J frame for concealed carry, and a Ruger GP100 also for carry, and more fire power. Having all arms fire the same ammo is nice. And the versatility of ammo is a plus too. From standard .38, to Buffalo Bore 180 gr. hard cast hunting rounds. ]]></comment_content>

    <title>I Have This Old Gun: Model 1860 Spencer Carbine</title>

      <![CDATA[Engineer Christopher Miner Spencer was one of those 19th century Yankee polymaths who was responsible for a huge number of different, fascinating contrivances. But it was his eponymous repeating rifle that really established his place in the hierarchy of American inventors. His remarkable seven-shooter was a wonder. Few military arms could come close to its reliability for a good number of years following its introduction.



Spencer patented his rifle on March 6, 1860. Featuring a rotating block and tubular magazine in the butt, the gun was a snap to use. The shooter simply dropped a number of cartridges, nose-first, into the magazine, then the spring-loaded follower was inserted into the tube and locked into place. Next, the hammer was put on half cock, and the lever lowered to allow a cartridge to be pushed into position by the follower. Raising the lever chambered the round. Now all one had to do was cock the hammer, aim, fire and repeat the process until the magazine was empty. Spent cases were ejected from the top of the receiver.



A factory was established at Cheney Brothers Silk Mfg. Co., where Spencer worked, and his arms company was in business. Early models involved smallbore sporting rifles, of .36 and .44 caliber, as well as prototype .44-cal. military arms.



At the beginning of the Civil War the Union Army’s principal infantry arm was a single-shot muzzleloading rifled musket, and the cavalry was supplied with a wide variety of breechloaders and muzzleloaders. After demonstrating his arm to the Navy Dept. in mid-1861, the U.S. Navy put in an order with Spencer for 700 rifles, which he boosted to 1,000. When some Army officers saw the rifle work, many were so impressed they purchased them privately for themselves and their men.



The gun was chambered in a rimfire .56-56 cartridge, though the caliber was actually .52-the .56-56 designation coming from the measurements at the top and bottom of the case, the bullets themselves actually ran in the 0.540"-0.552" range.



Reports from the field were universally favorable. The majority of early Spencers appear to have been rifle-length long arms, though it was as a carbine that the repeater really came into its own. Following Christopher Spencer’s personal shooting session with President Abraham Lincoln, the War Dept. increased orders dramatically. By the time the Civil War ended, some 50,000 had been made, not counting the follow-on .50-cal. Model 1865 manufactured by the Burnside Rifle Co., a plant drawn into production because the main manufacturing facility just couldn’t keep up with demand. It became the North’s second most popular carbine, topped only by the Sharps, and it was so highly sought-after that practically all delivered before the cessation of hostilities saw use. Today it is unusual to find a wartime Spencer in exceptional condition.



The Spencer shown here is in NRA Antique Very Good condition, with an excellent bore, traces of case-hardening and a good bit of patina on the barrel. As such, it would be worth $2,750 to $3,000.



<strong>Gun: Model 1860 Spencer Carbine</strong>

<strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Spencer Repeating Rifle Co., Boston, Mass.

<strong>Serial Number:</strong> 54803

<strong>Condition</strong>: NRA Antique Very Good

<strong>Caliber:</strong> .56-56 Spencer Rimfire

<strong>Value:</strong> $2,750 to $3,000]]>

      <![CDATA[Designed by former <em>American Rifleman</em> editor Ted Hatfield, the <a href="http://utas-usa.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">UTAS UTS-15’s</a> single, 18.5-inch barrel surpasses the minimum requirement for legality, yet the entire shotgun measures a mere 28 inches overall. The 7-pound Turkish shotgun features an all-polymer receiver that’s reinforced at stress points with magnesium. Its grip, trigger and fire-control buttons are borrowed from an AR-15 and therefore familiar.



A Picatinny rail allows for easy optic mounting, although you won’t need an aftermarket flashlight or laser because both are integral. The gun’s genius lies in its system of horizontally mounted magazine tubes that rest atop the barrel. Each hold 7 rounds of 2½-, 2¾- or 3-inch shells and is numbered for fast visual metering. Loading is accomplished via two separate ports, like this. When the magazine selector lever is set in the middle, the gun feeds alternately from each magazine. However, one magazine can be blocked in order to feed from the other magazine before defaulting to the other.



You can learn more about the UTS-15 in the video below, hosted by <a href="http://www.americanhunter.org" target="_blank"><em>American Hunter's</em> </a>Jeff Johnston.<strong></strong>



<strong>Technical Specifications:</strong>

<strong>Gauge:</strong> 2 ½”, 2 ¾” and 3”

<strong>Finish:</strong> Black, Desert, Hunting and Marine

<strong>Barrel Length:</strong> 18.5"

<strong>Overall Length:</strong> 28.3"

<strong>Weight:</strong> 6.9 lbs.

<strong>Capacity:</strong> 15 rounds

<strong>MSRP:</strong> $1,200 (Standard Finish)

        <![CDATA[I still don't trust bullpups. Aside from the fact that I shoot left-handed, bullpup chambers are located to close to where your head would be located while shooting. In the event of a catastrophic failure, it could mean the death or disfigurement of the shooter. I believe the Bullpup design was created just to get around the law. A 'legal' way of owning a rifle with a 16' barrel or a shotgun with an 18' barrel with the compact size of machine pistols or sawed-off shotguns. 
Has AR ever seen a gun it didn't like?

      <![CDATA[History tells us that the 1930s was not a time of serious discretionary income. The Great Depression had America by the throat and most people were glad to just get by. Still, it was also a time when the handgun makers developed and produced some milestone guns that changed the face of handgunning forever. Witness the goings-on in Springfield in the early 30s that resulted in the Registered Magnum. The gun was, at the same time, an engineering and technological breakthrough as well as an aesthetic and precision masterpiece. While the gun at hand didn’t quite equal that impact, it was a legendary maker’s response to the demands of its customers. The maker was <a href="http://www.colt.com/" target="_blank">Colt</a>; the gun was the Shooting Master.



And it said so, right down the left side of the barrel-<em>Colt Shooting Master-</em>followed by the caliber. The concept was to offer the customer a premium quality target revolver, optimized not only for accuracy, but also for shootability. Essentially, the gun was a variation of the big revolver in the Colt stable, known as the New Service. New Service revolvers were available all the way back to the late 19th century and had been made for the Army in the tens of thousands as the .45 ACP Model of 1917. During the half century of production of the New Service, Colt had offered the gun as a target model. This relatively scarce variant came with a flat-topped frame, adjustable sights and other embellishments.



By the late 1920s, accuracy-oriented shooting games like the USRA, NRA Outdoor and NRA Gallery matches, were growing and there was an increasing demand for accurate and shootable guns. Colt responded with a superb example of the accurate revolver. Shooting Masters were originally produced in just .38 Spl., but eventually became available in other calibers-.45 ACP, .45 Colt, .44 Spl., .357 Mag. and possibly others. Advertised as having a hand-honed action and careful attention to accuracy, the guns commanded a premium price. Not surprisingly, they were made in relatively small quantities. Shooting Masters were superbly fitted and finished revolvers, literally the very best of pre-war gunmaking at Colt. Colt must have wanted the world to know how proud the company was of them. They had a distinctive touch to set them off from other New Service models-an uncheckered cylinder latch.]]>

      <![CDATA[In use by the U.S. military and various government agencies, <a href="http://www.pistolwear.com/" target="_blank">Pistol Wear’s</a> patent-pending concealed-carry holsters are constructed from a body-conforming cushioned material that completely encloses the gun so that it does not touch the user’s skin.



An integrated adjustable belt system means that the holster’s function is not dependent on the user’s clothing, and a simple retaining strap allows noise-free access. The comfortable, lightweight designs are solvent-resistant and include a built-in perspiration barrier.]]>

If worn low on the belly, even close-quarters crowds are no problem. Access, however, is somewhat compromised although the nylon stiffeners keep your weapon free from binding in the pouch itself. Retention of your weapon is very good even if you were to take a tumble. After all, the primary intended use appeared, from the ads, to be for carry while jogging.

    <title>Deer Camp Design: Remington&#039;s Model 783</title>

      <![CDATA[In some hunting camps, what happens around the campfire stays around the campfire. Luckily, for most American big-game hunters, what happened around a campfire in the North Carolina Mountains in 2010 didn’t remain a hunting camp secret. Remington’s new Model 783 rifle proves that under the suits of some Remington executives, you’ll find camo.



In the fall of 2010, John Trull, Jay Bunting and John Fink-all of whom you might call “big dogs” within Remington’s rifle program-were on a deer hunt where they decided Remington needed a new rifle, one as accurate and dependable as a Remington Model 700 but less expensive. This is exactly what the American heritage of firearms manufacturing is about; building quality firearms that hard-working Americans can afford.



They left camp with a blueprint for what would become the Model 783, a model number with meaning. The “Seven” reflects the model 700’s legendary reliability and accuracy. The “Eight” was a call back to the Model 788, which was Remington’s last affordable alternative to the 700. And finally, the “Three” represents 2013; the year Remington would introduce this rifle. The “Three” could also represent the 30-year span-1983 until 2013-between the model 788 and the 783.



After their hunting camp revelation, Trull and Fink talked with hunters all across America to collect input on the new rifle. They knew it had to be dependable and accurate, but they also learned the importance hunters placed on the weight and handling of their rifles. With finalized specifications, Remington assigned the project to the plant in Mayfield, Ky., which is the same place Remington’s sister company, Marlin Firearms, manufacturers the Model X7.



On Sept. 11, 2012, the first production Model 783 rifles rolled off the line. A few days later, Fink drove to West Virginia with four of them and we headed out to a long and narrow cow pasture to see what they would do. After several hundred rounds, many fired out to 500 yards, Fink told me these rifles would retail for less than $450. I told Fink he had a winner and that Remington needed to let him go to hunting camp more often.



The Remington Model 783 is, in reality, a simple rifle, and that’s not a bad thing. It’s held together with five screws; two hold the stock to the action, one holds the trigger guard in place and the remaining two mount the trigger to the action. If you take the rifle completely apart you have 10 pieces, and five are screws. (Bolt disassembly will yield a few additional parts.)



The Model 783’s action is cylindrical, measuring 1.355 inches in diameter. The bolt body measures only 0.695 inches in diameter so that means that, less operating tolerances, you have a lot of steel there for strength. The action has a long but narrow ejection port when compared to most bolt-actions, and this helps with rigidity too. It’s also drilled and tapped to accept dedicated Remington 783 scope bases or two Model 700 front bases.



The rigid action was one of the design elements settled on at hunting camp. Another was the medium-contour barrel. Stiff barrels dampen harmonics. Every Model 783 has the same barrel contour, measuring 1.074 inches in front of the action/barrel nut and tapering to 0.662 inches at the muzzle, regardless of caliber. The action/barrel nut is reminiscent of those used by Savage and Marlin. It allows for simpler and very precise headspacing. The nut is just shy of an inch long and sandwiches a 0.185-inch-thick recoil lug between the face of the action and the action/barrel nut. The recoil lug is 1.1-inches wide and extends almost a half-inch down into a recess in the stock.



The synthetic stock is injection-molded, but it’s a bit stiffer than those commonly used on entry-level-price bolt-action rifles. It was also a product of the hunting camp discussions: the Remington blokes didn’t want the stock to feel cheap or flimsy, so they specified a different polymer blend. Being the hunters they are, they also knew the interface between the stock and the barreled action contributes to accuracy. So, they specified a free-floating barrel and included aluminum pillars for the front and rear action screws to pass though.



The black synthetic stock, which will soon be available in five camo patterns, has a modern profile. It comes with a SuperCell recoil pad, integral sling swivel attachment points and stippling panels on the fore-end and grip. It is very comfortable to carry or shoulder, and the comb is positioned for low-scope mounts. The trigger guard is polymer and racy looking, just like the stock, and is open enough for gloved fingers. It’s held in place by the rear action screw and short screw, which threads into the stock.



Forward of the trigger guard is the detachable-box magazine. It has a steel body with a polymer follower and base plate, and was smartly designed to fit flush with the bottom of the rifle for ease of carrying. It’s also easy to remove due to a large recess at the front where the release button is located.



The bolt has a floating head fitted with a Model 700-style plunger ejector. The extractor, however, fits flat against the bolt face and is held in place by spring tension and a ball bearing. It moves perpendicular to the bolt in channels cut in one of the two opposing locking lugs. The bolt release is positioned on the left rear of the action and is mounted to the trigger housing.



Two distinct features of the bolt are the scallops on the bolt shroud and the flat bolt handle. Engineers at Mayfield conceived both features after the three deer hunters turned the project over to them. The scalloped bolt shroud continues the racy profile, and the flat bolt handle-while of the same profile as that of a Model 700-provides a bit of uniqueness while offering additional scope clearance for those who prefer the sleek profile of a low-mounted scope.



And then there’s the trigger. Triggers with passive safeties were popularized by Glock but are increasingly more common on rifles these days. It’s a way of providing a good trigger pull without worrying about inadvertent discharges or liability. The 783’s trigger uses a center lever that must be depressed before the trigger can be pulled. It’s exactly the same trigger used by Marlin on the X7 bolt-actions. I’m a trigger snob because a good trigger is essential to accurate shooting, particularly when shooting offhand like many hunters need to do. The trigger on the 783 is adjustable, has no take-up and is creep-free with just a slight bit of over-travel.



Even though I was the first non-Remington employee to shoot a Model 783 back in September of 2012, I didn’t get the opportunity to put one through an intensive workout. Yeah, I shot those rifles out to 500 yards and found I could expect about 11/2 minute-of-angle or better accuracy from each of them. But that was with one load.



I’d been looking forward to an opportunity to test a Model 783 without one of its architects looking over my shoulder. So, when I received a 783 in .30-’06 Sprg. for evaluation, I mounted a good riflescope-a Trijicon 3-9x40 mm Accupoint-and headed to the range. I fired 200 rounds out of the 783, 80 from the bench and the rest from various field positions. After zeroing I worked from various unsupported positions banging steel out to around 150 yards. The rifle was sweet on the shoulder and 5 inch and 6 inch steel targets between 50 and 150 yards. were easy to hit, time after time.



At the bench, things were going real well until I tested a third load. When the first round went off it was a bit louder and kicked a bit harder than normal and I felt a push of gas in my face. I leaned back, looked at the rifle and gas was leaking out around the action like it was on fire.



I took this as a definitive clue something was wrong. The bolt had to be pounded open and the cartridge case had to be manually removed. It was an obvious overpressure situation with a 180-grain factory load. The primer had flattened and blown out, and the extractor had ripped the rim off the case when the bolt was forced open. The extractor also popped out of its raceway.



After thoroughly examining the rifle, I reinstalled the extractor and wisely switched to different ammunition to finish accuracy testing. I then fired five more, five-shot groups but had to pull each fired case out with my fingers since the ejector was stuck in the bolt face.



I forwarded images of the cartridge case to a ballistician, and he hypothesized pressure had been in excess of 100,000 p.s.i.-well above .30-’06 Sprg. proof-load pressure and near twice the standard pressure. Here’s the good news; the rifle handled the excessive pressure exceptionally well. Lessons learned? The 783 has a strong action, and always wear shooting glasses.



As a side note, that questionable box of ammunition was returned to the manufacturer for inspection and to determine the cause of the overpressure load. Once evaluated, appropriate recalls and warnings will be issued.



After working with the Model 783 in .30-’06 Sprg., I’m more impressed now with Remington’s newest than I was last fall with one of the first off the assembly line. The rifle is a joy to shoot, pleasingly accurate and a tremendous bargain for the money. In fact, it would be a good bargain even at Remington 700 prices, which start at $100 more.



None of us should be surprised. After all, three experienced hunters sitting around a campfire designed the 783. That, in my mind, is exactly how a real hunting rifle should be developed. Yep, a lot of things that happen at deer camp should stay there. We should all be glad that the concept of this rifle didn’t. In my opinion the Model 783 is the best new hunting rifle of 2013-at any price point.]]>

    <title>Browning Double Mode</title>

      <![CDATA[The BDM was a high-capacity, 9 mm pistol made in the USA and sold by <a href="http://www.browning.com/" target="_blank">Browning Arms</a> in the 1991 to 1998 period. Browning gave it this name, which stands for “Browning Double Mode.”



The BDM system was like no other and has never been imitated or duplicated. For reasons that escape me, the BDM did not sell and was discontinued in 1999, some eight years after a splashy introduction. The main appeal of the design was a means of alternately configuring it for either DA/SA trigger action or the increasingly popular DAO style. This was performed by simply turning a switch on the slide to “R” for a revolver-like double-action trigger pull for every shot. Using the screwdriver-like tool on the magazine baseplate, the shooter turns to “P” for typical DA/SA trigger action-first shot DA, subsequent shot SA. The lever (not the mode switch) on the frame acts as a decocker and a manual safety in the “P” mode. In the “R” mode, it is a plain safety. Peter Sodoma, the Czech designer worked hard to make this pistol fit every possible police, military and concealed-carry need.



I had a couple of the guns for review back in the 90s and fired them a good bit more than I usually did with a new model. There were no malfunctions in probably 1,000 rounds and I felt the gun’s performance was excellent. Since then I have read other reviews that also gave the BDM high marks. But I have also read a couple of highly critical ones. This seems odd, but that is the report. The system may have been a little “busy,” and I think it may have confused some shooters. There were some subtle features that were particularly attractive, like the way the “R” mode worked. The hammer was down for all shots and the shooter had to work a pretty decent DA trigger to cock to fire each shot. If, for any reason, he or she wanted to fire with a short, light, crisp single-action pull, he just cocked the hammer. Also, the pistol had superior ergonomics, which made it a natural for shooters with small hands. BDMs were not widely used in law enforcement, but I know of one Sheriff’s Department that approved their use. Some of their more active officers used them in actual shootouts. It is sad that such a good design never achieved the recognition it deserved.]]>

Too many choices causes confusion, and with this Browning DBA setup the average officer would forget which mode he had decided to set his pistol in for that day.

In several police-involved shootings I worked, the officer's Sig was still cocked in his holster because after the traumatic incident he forgot to de-cock.

        <![CDATA[How can one miss the obvious? The thumb-safety that arguably millions have familiarity with onthe 1911 and BHP is set-up the WRONG WAY~!  Down to decock/Safe and UP to fire is not ergo-friendly with a frame-mounted unit. Perfectly fine on Walther/Smith/Berettas. However, the fine unit on the Makarov makes use of the time-honored JMB method, even with its slide-mounted safety.

      <![CDATA[The escalating prices of components have caused me to reevaluate my approach to handloading for my semi-automatic handguns. Even small savings on propellant and bullets add up to a significant amount when shooting several thousand rounds of 9 mm Luger, .40 S&amp;W or .45 ACP cartridges. A few dollars can be saved buying components in bulk; however, banking real money requires thinking outside the box of conventional reloading.



<strong>Appropriate Propellants</strong>

The cost of propellants can be significantly reduced by choosing a relatively fast-burning option that develops the intended bullet velocity while using less powder. For example, a 200-grain cast bullet leaving the muzzle of a .45 ACP at 800 to 850 f.p.s. makes a great practice and plinking load. According to Hodgdon Powder’s 2013 Annual Manual, 6.5 grains of AutoComp are required to reach that velocity level in the .45 ACP. However, only 4.8 grs. of TiteGroup or 4.3 grains of Clays are necessary to attain that speed. By merely switching to lighter charges of faster-burning propellants, up to one-third more rounds can be fired per pound of propellant.



Of course, it’s a good idea to shoot a sample batch to be certain such minimum-propellant charges reliably cycle a pistol’s action. The slide failed to fully seat twice in my Colt Gold Cup National Match shooting 50 .45 ACPs loaded with 200-grain bullets and 4.1 grains of Ramshot Competition with its heavy recoil spring in place. Three .40 S&amp;W cases “stove piped” in the closing slide of a SIG Sauer P226 while shooting 40 cartridges loaded with 3.3 grains of Clays and 180-grain bullets. The SIG, though, chugged along like a steam locomotive shooting 5.1 grains of Ramshot ZIP and 155-grain bullets. The Glock 19 9 mm Luger functioned flawlessly throughout 80 rounds of reduced-volume loads.



These minimum amounts of propellant still developed uniform velocities. Autoloading handgun cases were designed for smokeless propellant, so they have less unoccupied case capacity compared to cases intended for revolvers. The .40 S&amp;W produced velocity spreads of only 15 f.p.s. over 20 rounds, the .45 ACP rounds varied 30 f.p.s. and the 9 mm Lugers spread 19 f.p.s., and that was with propellants dispensed from a powder measure.



<strong>Bullet Bargains</strong>

There is little sense in shooting an expensive jacketed bullet at less than 1200 f.p.s. from a pistol cartridge for practice. A price check of several reloading supply websites showed .45-cal. jacketed bullets cost nearly three times more than swaged-lead or cast-lead-alloy bullets, which cost about the same. The drawback to swaged-lead bullets, though, is that they are so soft they leave behind increasing smears of lead in a pistol’s bore. And some manufacturers of semi-automatic pistols recommend against using cast bullets in their guns, regardless of hardness, so check your owner’s manual.



But ordinary lead bullets and cast lead bullets are not necessarily the same. The melt of cast bullets is a mix of antimony and tin that hardens lead. A bullet cast of the proper lead alloy and shot at the correct velocity leaves a pistol barrel free of lead. At most, a thin wash of lead remains after shooting several hundred rounds. If leading does occur at the breech, it may indicate that a cast bullet is too soft or hard. A bullet that is too soft leads because it is unable to withstand the pressure and gas erosion. A bullet that’s too hard leads because of its failure to expand and seal the bore against propellant gases that erode up the side of the bullet. If leading occurs at the muzzle, decreasing velocity and switching to a harder bullet and a better lubricant are the cure.



Mold manufacturers recommend casting with certain alloys from its molds to produce bullets of the intended weight and as-cast diameter. For instance, RCBS suggests a lead alloy of 10 percent tin, 90 percent lead for its pistol molds while SAECO recommends Taracorp’s Lawrence Magnum alloy (0.25 percent arsenic, 2 percent tin, 6 percent antimony, 91.75 percent lead) for its molds. Molds are usually cut to drop bullets slightly larger than their intended diameter to compensate for casting with a variety of alloys. Bullets are then sized to exact diameter.



Whatever alloy casters use, they should be concerned about uniform bullet weights, not an exact weight. Some cast bullet companies do not state the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN) of their bullets. Others, such as Missouri Bullet Co., do. Missouri Bullet casts bullets with a BHN of 15 to 18 for 9 mm bullets, 18 for 40-cal. bullets and 12 to 18 for .45 Auto bullets.



To provide a tight seal in the bore, the diameter of cast bullets should be at, or 0.001 inch larger than, the groove-to-groove diameter of a pistol’s bore. Most cast bullet firms produce bullets 0.001 inch larger in diameter than comparable jacketed bullets.



Be aware that seating a larger-diameter bullet may bulge a case and cause the cartridge to fail to fit in the chamber.



<strong>Shooting Results</strong>

After firing 80 .40 S&amp;W cartridges loaded with 155- and 180-grain cast bullets, I paused to inspect the SIG Sauer P226 for signs of lead fouling. Its feed ramp was clean as a whistle. The bore was somewhat black. A brush loosened the fouling. Like a snooty butler wiping a shelf with a white-gloved finger for dust, I pushed a clean patch through the bore to check for the presence of lead. There was none. After firing 100 cast bullets through my Colt .45 ACP I also examined its bore. It was lead-free. A Glock 19’s bore was clean as a whistle after shooting 80 9 mm bullets cast from a SAECO mold. Where would the lead adhere anyway? The Glock’s hexagonal rifling does away with the sharp edges of traditional grooves and lands. I went back to shooting the pistols, confident the cast bullets were actually improving the pistols by polishing their feed ramps and bores.



That shooting is easy on the pocket, too. A box of 50 .40 S&amp;W cartridges cost about $7 loaded with commercial cast bullets. A box of 9 mm Luger loaded with home-cast bullets costs about $3 and .45 Autos just a few cents more. Those inexpensive cartridges have reined in ammunition costs to enable me to keep shooting my pistols with a tightfisted hold.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[One thing to add, the use of inexpensive gas checks seated behind a bullet are another good way to minimize lead buildup. They'll leave your barrel clean as a whistle. But the cost of softer lead bullets + gas checks about equals the cost of just harder cast and no gas checks, so that's a coin toss. Great article on cost savings, thanks. Definitely the way to go, to save your shooting dollars, and get more practice time.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Love my 1911 so I'm not a Glock fan, but I did some research to better understand why not to shoot cast in Glocks [(]aside from just being told not to[)]: 'The advantage of polygonal rifling [(]Glocks[)] is that there is less distortion to the bullet and less fouling since the rifling isn't  'cutting' into the bullet. Also less gas leakage around the bullet since the gas can't get by from having no grooves, and also higher resulting velocity. However, the downside is that there are no grooves [(]1911s[)] to 'accept' the fouling. Consequently polygonal rifling is more prone to develop a partial obstruction and the resulting higher pressures as fouling occurs.'  So the concern is valid. Solution: Plated bullets to the rescue, for Glocks. No big deal, and lead buildup avoided--Yes?]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Also there are many cast bullets of the 'modified Kieth' design, that have a sharp edge at the base of the ogive, rather than a gradual rounded one. These are more prone to producing small lead shavings as they engage the rifling, and leaving them behind in the barrel. That's why 22 long rifle bores have a tendency to buildup lead in their throat areas, and require frequent cleaning for optimal accuracy. Same principle here. I'm sure this  accumulation, in combination with their smooth polygonal bores was enough reason for Glock to void warrantees for cast bullets. So one more clarification to a possible solution: Use only rounded ogive plated bullets, avoiding all modified Keith styles, and no leading or shavings should ever occur with frequent cleaning. That's the best you can do, and quite feasible. Anyone out there with experience using plated bullets in Glocks?]]></comment_content>

    <title>Build Your Own AR from Scratch</title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=25307</link>
    <pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2013 11:19:40 +0000</pubDate>

    <content_encoded>
      <![CDATA[Adaptability-it is likely the foremost reason the AR has become America’s universal modern <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/Rifles" target="_blank">rifle platform</a> and is unquestionably a serendipitous byproduct of the gun’s modular design and space-age construction. It also meshes perfectly with American shooters’ penchant to own something a little different. When it comes to building an AR from the ground up, modularity means it can be easily tailored from the start, or modified after the fact, to suit the specific, often evolving, requirements and tastes of all manner of users.



In fact, a do-it-yourself build is perhaps the only way to end up with exactly the AR you want. At least that was the conclusion I came to and the reason for this project. My aim here is not to retrace every aspect of the AR-building process in step-by-step fashion-that has already been covered elsewhere-rather it is to suggest how to approach the process and to convey a few of the tips I learned along the way that might make it less stressful the first time around.



I admit that the AR rifle platform had never been my favorite, but even as a lifelong fan of the Garand-based gas guns, particularly the M1A, I could no longer resist the accuracy, parts availability and adaptability inherent in the AR’s modular design, or its long military pedigree. So, I decided that, starting with an ordinary AR flattop upper and standard lower receiver, I would build an all-around rifle suitable for target work, hunting and self-defense-within the limits of the .223 Rem. cartridge. A carbine might have been the more popular choice, but therein lies the beauty of such a project-you build the gun that suits your needs and preferences despite what the masses are doing. Regardless of your reasons for going the built-it-yourself route, however, the first step should be to decide what role or roles you intend the finished rifle to perform. For example, a dedicated close-quarters self-defense carbine will call for an entirely different set of components and design parameters than a long-range varminter. Either choice is entirely valid and easily achievable, though, given the myriad choices in available components.



One company has simplified the process of building your own AR like no other by stocking what is likely the largest selection of AR components-1,500 individual parts from 175 vendors at last count-ever warehoused under one roof. That company, <a href="http://www.brownells.com" target="_blank">Brownell’s</a> of Montezuma, Iowa, has a nearly 75-year track record of supplying  the gunsmithing trade and consumers with the best available firearm components, tools and advice. And, despite its enviable reputation for old-fashioned customer service, it is not in the habit of getting behind the times. So a few years ago it constructed a dedicated website, <a href="http://www.ar15builder.com" target="_blank">ar15builder.com</a>, for the express purpose of allowing its customers to virtually configure their own ARs using its vast inventory of receivers, barrels, stocks, fore-ends and other components. I tried it and found it enjoyable and helpful for learning about the various components, their compatibility and their prices. I also viewed the company’s DVD, “How To Build an AR-15” and read the book <em>The AR-15 Complete Assembly Guide</em> by Walt Kuleck with Clint McKee from <a href="http://www.scott-duff.com" target="_blank">Scott Duff Publications</a>. All of that pre-build activity better prepared me to discuss the build with suppliers and to perform the final assembly.



After forming a few gut feelings about the direction I wanted to go with the rifle and jotting a short list of questions, I picked up the phone and called Brownells, asking to speak with one of its more than 14 staff gunsmiths-all of whom, by the way, have built at least one AR. When Mike, a self-described “M1911 man” who had nevertheless built somewhere between six and 10 ARs, came on the line, I proceeded to pepper him with my thoughts, concerns and questions, and he was able to walk me through them in short order.



In completing the build illustrated here, my first, I found one of the most challenging aspects of the process was thinking far enough ahead when selecting specific components so that subsequent choices would be compatible and complementary. Each choice brought with it the somewhat agonizing opportunity to stick with the plan or to deviate for some reason that I may not have considered earlier. As a result, I ordered the parts in three or four separate shipments over a period of several weeks and simply set them all aside in a box to begin assembly at a later date. What you’ll find on p. 72 are descriptive vignettes of each of the resulting subassemblies and/or specific components that I believe lent the rifle its unique identity.



When the time came to assemble the rifle, I found that it went together quite easily because of the familiarity I had gained with its operation and construction by watching the video and reading the book. In addition, all of the parts were delivered as-advertised-properly packaged and complete. I simply took my time and worked only as far as the parts, tools, time and my patience allowed. But when the time finally came to assemble the completed upper and lower assemblies, I realized that any certainty about whether it would hit the mark I had established in my mind would come only after I fired the first shots.



After checking headspace with “go” and “no-go” gauges, I gathered some ammunition and took it to the range where I cautiously fired the first round. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the gun cycled and chambered the second as it should. After shooting a third time I went downrange and was pleased to find a cluster of holes in the target about the size of a dime. There were a couple of failures to fully chamber during the break-in process that followed, but the gun has since run without a hitch and continues to turn in excellent accuracy, particularly with the heavier bullets for which the barrel was designed.



If asked to describe the AR that resulted from this project, I would characterize it as a “special purpose rifle”-compact  and quick-handling enough for short-range self-defense use yet endowed with enough true rifle characteristics for moderately long-range shooting. One unanticipated result, an all-up weight of 12 pounds, 12 ounces, is about the only disappointing aspect of the build. But after the shock of the scale’s revelation wore off, I decided that for a rifle with such a stout barrel profile, quick-release optics, metal back-up sights, a metal fore-end and a bipod the weight was justified-of course that won’t stop me from attempting to prune it a bit by looking into upgrades such as a lightweight integrated optic mount.



In the end, the gun’s overall configuration, features and capabilities are exactly what I sought at the outset months earlier. Although the total build cost-including the scope, rings and bases-was in excess of $3,000, it is in line with fully-equipped top-of-the-line rifles. Plus, the gun shoots well and provides the feel and performance I always wanted from an AR but couldn’t seem to buy outright. Also, the experience of building it from scratch gave me a much greater understanding of the AR’s design and construction and far greater respect for America’s most popular rifle.



<strong>LRB Arms Receivers</strong>

If there’s one set of components that will have a cascading effect on an AR build, for better or for worse, it’s the upper and lower receivers. Buying from a reputable parts vendor such as Brownells all but ensures that both will be made from properly hardened aluminum alloys by the correct processes and machined to exacting dimensions in key areas. In addition, holes will be free of burrs and finishes will be even and closely matching. Consider that a flat-top upper will allow for greater versatility of the finished product with regard to optics mounting. I had coincidentally ordered receivers directly from the manufacturer, <a href="http://www.lrbarms.com" target="_blank">LRB Arms</a>, before the run on AR rifles and parts began. I chose LRB partly because of my high regard for the company’s signature product-hammer-forged semi-automatic M14-type receivers-and partly because I knew that its vendor, JV Precision Machine Co., produces the company’s AR receivers from 7075-T6 aluminum forgings to close tolerances and high standards of quality. Both upper ($110) and lower ($110) receivers exhibited fine fit and consistent finish and showed no evidence of burrs or other manufacturing glitches.



<strong>Daniel Defense Barrel &amp; Rail</strong>

Not only is the barrel the heart of a gun’s accuracy, its length and weight can heavily influence the entire build. With that in mind, it was the first component I selected from Brownells after buying the receivers. I decided early on to go for a barrel capable of handling heavier bullets, those in the 75- to 77-grain range, having a true 5.56x45 mm NATO chamber accompanied by a 1:7-inch twist rate. One of my Brownells advisors highly recommend <a href="http://www.danieldefense.com" target="_blank">Daniel Defense</a>, so I chose the company’s 18" Strength 2 Weight (S2W) model ($279), which I believed would provide a good balance between optimized velocities and reasonable handling and portability. The choice also dictated another fundamental design consideration in building an AR: The barrel’s gas port location and 0.750-inch measurement at the boss for the gas block required the use of a mid-length, rather than carbine- or rifle-length gas system and thus simplified other decisions when it came time to select the fore-end, gas block/front sight assembly and gas tube. The barrel’s stout profile, hammer-forged chromemoly-vanadium steel construction and salt bath nitride treatment inside and out were further assurances that it would likely deliver good accuracy and be durable over the long haul. Its M4-style feed ramps mated perfectly with corresponding cuts in the LRB upper. Because I knew I wanted to mount certain accessories on the fore-end, but was not a fan of the round, extended models now in vogue, I chose Daniel Defense’s Lite Rail 9.0 ($365). It is machined and welded as one piece and free-floats the barrel by attaching to the upper receiver with a special barrel nut, an included spanner and a collar that secures the rear of the unit to a matching flange with six Allen-head machine screws. Its upper rail surface mated nearly seamlessly with the upper receiver’s rail, and it stopped just short of the gas block.



<strong>DPMS Internals</strong>

Both upper and lower receivers, if ordered as stripped components, require the addition of numerous small parts, including tiny roll pins, detents and springs, usually sold as “parts kits” or “completion kits.” These were and continue to be some of items hardest-hit by the insatiable nationwide demand for AR rifles, parts and accessories. Once Brownells informed me by e-mail that they were once again available, I chose to keep things simple and ordered their polybagged kits as supplied to them by <a href="http://www.dpmsinc.com" target="_blank">DPMS</a>, which has a long history of providing mil-spec AR components to the firearm industry. My thinking was that securing things in that manner would help move the project along, allowing for selective upgrading, such as with an adjustable trigger, when my needs and additional funds became available. For the Upper Receiver Parts Kit, Mid-Length ($59) that included the ejection port cover and forward assist assemblies, the gas tube and other small parts. For the Lower Parts Kit ($60) it included the trigger and safety selector components. Other required assortments include the Buttstock Mounting Kit ($52) with buffer tube and buffer components. I also ordered a DPMS Bolt Carrier ($58) and Bolt ($45) because I knew they would be military-grade and because they were among the few available.



<strong>Magpul Furniture</strong>

Having begun as a manufacturer of flexible polymer magazine pulls designed to allow more rapid and sure magazine changes in combat, <a href="http://www.magpul.com" target="_blank">Magpul</a> Industries has evolved into one of the largest producers of polymer AR magazines, stocks, fore-ends, sights, slings and more. Its Magpul Original Equipment, or MOE, components, as their name implies, are supplied on a host of factory rifles and have come to all but dominate the aftermarket for individuals seeking to build their own ARs. For this project, I chose the fixed MOE Rifle Stock ($70), which has smooth contours that afford a comfortable cheekweld along with multiple attachment points for push-button sling swivel cups and a ribbed rubber buttpad that hinges to allow storage of a cleaning rod and other supplies. I also chose the MOE + Grip ($24), with rubber overmolding, and the company’s signature AFG2 Angled Fore-Grip ($35), which, mounted fully to the rear of the fore-end’s lower Picatinny rail, presents a comfortable purchase point for the support hand for efficient use of the gun in close-range, dynamic scenarios yet still allows mounting of the bipod ahead of it. The choice of such components is important because of how they allow it to interface with the shooter. Magpul seems to have dialed-in ergonomic design, which means the shooter can remain comfortable and relaxed during extended or stressful sessions, resulting in more hits on the targets.



<strong>Sights, Optics &amp; Mounts</strong>

I wanted a quality set of iron sights and decided to go with a barrel-mounted front unit for a little more sight radius and because it left the upper Picatinny rail clear for possible use with a scout-mounted scope. As with a rack-grade military AR, the base of the No. 41-BL Silhouette Folding Front Sight ($160) from <a href="http://www.armsmounts.com" target="_blank">A.R.M.S.</a> I chose has that familiar triangular shape when raised and serves as the gas block and sling mounting point although I chose to address the latter by mounting a push-button-style sling point on the left Picatinny rail so as to prevent influencing the barrel through sling tension. I mounted an ARMS No. 40L-SP ($120) at the rear, and was pleased to see that its base contour neatly matched that of the upper receiver. Both units are made of steel and fold quickly, allowing an unobstructed view through the riflescope or other optics.



As to optics, there are myriad choices available for ARs, from small, non-magnifying reflex sights to large, high-magnification scopes, and a host of mounts and rings as well. Regardless of which type of optic is chosen, reasonable quality can mean that it and its attendant mounts and accessories might exceed the cost of the rifle itself. So before making a decision, consider such basics as: suitability to the type of shooting anticipated; compatibility with iron sights-e. g. the ability to ”co-witness”-rail mounting area requirements; and, of course, optical quality and price. I chose the VX-R Patrol 1.5-4 X 20 mm scope with FireDot Special Purpose Reticle ($580) from <a href="http://www.leupold.com" target="_blank">Leupold</a> set in the company’s Mark 4 Tactical steel rings ($164) and mounted atop an Accucam Quick Detach Scout Length Mounting Base ($159) from <a href="http://www.gggaz.com" target="_blank">GG&amp;G</a> mostly because I had them on hand. Given the capabilities of the rifle, greater magnification would certainly be in order. But the combination has proven to allow for quick yet precise aiming at close targets and yet turns in respectably small groups on paper at moderate distances as shown in the accompanying table.



<strong>Bits &amp; Pieces</strong>

Sometimes the details on a project can make all the difference, and a handful of small components helped make this particular AR more suited to my personal preferences. One was the Ambidextrous Safety Selector ($60) from <a href="http://www.battlearmsdevelopment.com" target="_blank">Battle Arms Development</a>. Ordered as a kit with a variety of lever styles, it allows the user to select a favorite length and thickness to install on each side of the gun. Another drop-in worth its weight in gold is the Ambi-Catch ($90) by <a href="http://www.norgon.com" target="_blank">Norgon, LLC</a>, which allows the magazine to be released by pressing in on the left side as well as preserving the primary release on the right.



Two other items that made a big difference in handling and configurability, respectively, are the Badger Ordnance (badgerordnance.com) Tactical Charging Handle ($100) and the company’s TRAMP bipod mount ($60). The former makes grasping and retracting the charging handle faster and less demanding of fine motor skills and the latter allows a QD-stud-mounted bipod, such as the ubiquitous and durable SL ($133) from <a href="http://www.harrisbipods.com" target="_blank">Harris</a> shown here, easy to lock onto and remove from the lower Picatinny rail with one hand-the key to both being skeletonized grasping “ears.” Finally, the CA556AR203 ($130) combination flash suppressor/sound suppressor interface from <a href="http://www.surefire.com" target="_blank">SureFire</a> has a reasonably traditional appearance at the end but includes a long “skirt” that allows for easy fitting of a long bayonet or sound suppressor.]]>

        <![CDATA[MilSpec is OK, essential if you're selling to the Pentagon.  But there are better barrel steels, better alloys and surface treatments.
If all you want or need is a rifle that will shoot $2,000 worth of ammo while you have it you don't need MilSpec.  If you want a gun that will shoot $20,000 worth of ammo and 70+ grain bullets, you might need MilSpec.
You will want to know what parts are different, such as buffer tubes.

        <![CDATA[Reading below, it seems there is indeed a good point to be made here, to address the issue of  interchangeability of parts in AR builds [(]thanks, RJB[)]. And like Jim infers, you can fill a whole book on the topic, in fact several books, to have a full understanding. Reading up will save you a lot of headache, and re-work. I won't try to expound that here, but perhaps point out just a few basic things for beginners, to keep out of trouble and give a feel of what you'll need to know :
1[)] Jim is right. Other than slapping on a few external accessories, its a good idea to read up on the subject, and at the very least consult an experienced AR builder to mentor with. And you'll need the correct tools to do it.
2[)] Buy your barrel assembly and bolt complete, to assure proper chamber heasdspace from the factory. If not, have it locally checked with a go/no-go guage, to avoid unpleasant case separations or worse. In spite of good modern machine tolerances nowadays, you still need always check for proper headspace.
3[)] Shorty barrels are notorious for hard case extractions with max loads. Good idea to always buy an adjustable gas block or tube, to fine tune it when testing.  If you don't know this, you'll wrongly blame the manufacturer for 'out of spec' parts, which is not the case. 
4[)] When shopping for parts, always call first and ask the seller if its compatible with your brand of receiver. This is especially true of buffer tubes, barrel nuts, gas blocks, and trigger groups. They'll tell you the right ones to buy.
5[)] Order your barrel with the upgraded M4 barrel extension, to help avoid cycling problems.
6 [)] Be aware of large vs small pin receivers. You may need adapter pins to match them up. Bushmaster is a good source for them. Same goes for buying trigger groups, which come in both pin types. It's an easy thing to order the wrong set because you didn't ask first.
7[)] Always buy factory matched complete trigger groups. Mix and match is just asking for trouble. You get what you pay for here. Most stock triggers don't have what it takes to let you shoot sub-moa groups. A good high end adjustable trigger is worth its weight in gold. It took a Guisselle trigger I installed for my friend below, to prove the gun could shoot sub-moa. I would have had a much harder time fighting a stock trigger to prove it.

Sorry, that's all I have time for, there's lots more than this--hope this helps. Good luck, and yes its very rewarding, and great fun building your own custom gun.

After that, a few custom features to sub out, such as stock, trigger group, or gas block, and your done. Finally, optics of your choice. Piece of cake, with only the slightest of mentoring from someone.]]></comment_content>

    <title>Six Reasons American Rifleman TV is Better than Duck Dynasty</title>

      <![CDATA[Temperatures are cooling, fall’s rapidly approaching and television shows are returning from their summer hiatus. In case you haven’t been paying attention, <a href="http://outdoorchannel.com/american-rifleman-tv" target="_blank">American Rifleman TV</a> is still airing on Wednesday nights over on the <a href="http://www.outdoorchannel.com" target="_blank">Outdoor Channel</a>.



Effectively an on-screen version of our flagship <em>American Rifleman</em> magazine, ARTV is a pre-eminent source for accurate, compelling and authoritative information on firearms, the shooting sports and the Second Amendment.



So, what’s holding it back? Well, right now ARTV is airing opposite a program that happens to be quite popular: <a href="http://www.aetv.com/duck-dynasty/" target="_blank">A&amp;E’s Duck Dynasty</a>.



I’ve taken it upon myself to defend ARTV’s honor against those quack-obsessed Robertson’s-so here are my top six reasons you should be settling down in front of American Rifleman TV each Wednesday night, rather than heading off to Robertsonland.



<strong>Guns, Guns, Guns</strong>

The Robertson’s bring plenty to the table but, particularly of late, fans are getting a lot more zany antics and lot less hunting and guns. A recent episode involved a trip to the batting cage, which is all well and good-but if you’re looking for guns, American Rifleman TV is what you want. From the “Rifleman Review” to “I Have This Old Gun,” the team covers the whole gamut. Want an expert’s opinion on the latest release from <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com" target="_blank">Smith &amp; Wesson</a>? You’ve got it. Want to see what happens at the <a href="http://www.sigsauer.com/" target="_blank">SIG</a> Academy? Yeah, our guys have been there a few times. I mean, we’ve got the <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13201&amp;cat=3&amp;sub=11" target="_blank">Rough Riders’ Potato Digger</a>! As in the Teddy Roosevelt Rough Riders! Now that’s a gun. Save the batting cages and go-kart races for kids’ birthday parties. When you settle into your favorite spot on the couch come Wednesday evening, you need to be watching ARTV.



<strong>It’s Better to Fall Asleep To</strong>

Look, both shows air at 10 p.m. on Wednesday night-so it’s safe to say that a fair share of each audience is snoozing before the credits roll. When push comes to shove, would you rather gently doze off to the sound of another Robertson scheme gone badly, or the soothing tones of Managing Editor <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/search.php?search=aaron%20carter&amp;stype=5&amp;p=1" target="_blank">Aaron Carter’s</a> voice? To top it off, some folks have a habit of retaining the things they hear in their sleep. So, when you wake up in the morning, which would you have rather committed to memory: The twist rate of the latest <a href="http://www.glock.com/GlockLanding/index.html" target="_blank">Glock</a>, or the sweet talk that Phil used to get Miss Kay to fulfill her half of their “marital duties?” Yeah, I think I’ll take the gun talk.



<strong>Brian Sheetz &gt; Uncle Si</strong>

Uncle Si’s famous for being the zaniest of the Robertson clan, and rightfully so. But he’s got nothing on our own <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/search.php?search=brian%20sheetz&amp;stype=5&amp;p=1" target="_blank">Brian Sheetz</a>. The network folks wanted to keep things prim and proper for ARTV, so Brian tones things down-but don’t let his professional exterior fool you. This guy’s a real hardware geek and outdoor nut. Put a few candid cameras on him, and he’d put Si to shame. We’re talking about a guy who left last year’s office Christmas party with an emergency solar panel-and was excited about it. A guy who spends most weekends scouring flea markets for obscure gun parts. In the rare instances he does come back inside, he’s got more dirt on his nose than a mischievous Labrador retriever. Last week one of our range guys threw out a rusty old bucket and Brian mumbled something about “wasting an emergency latrine.” Trust us: Television isn’t ready for the real Brian Sheetz.



<strong>Our Staff Hasn’t Lost Their Razors</strong>

Look, we know the beards have become some of a brand for the Robertson family, but enough is enough. Their unkempt style has led to a nationwide surge in unwise facial hair decisions, and something needs to be done about it. Not everyone can pull off the “something’s living on my face” look. That’s why our editors still tend to stay clean-shaven-it sets a better example for the kids in the audience, who won’t grow up with delusions of beard grandeur. And, as <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/search.php?search=mark%20keefe&amp;stype=5&amp;p=1" target="_blank">Mark Keefe</a> notes, the Robertson’s look could provide real problems with a shotgun action if they're not careful with where that hair gets to. Plus, isn’t there just something a little more trustworthy about Associate Editor <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article_list_author.php?id=46" target="_blank">Joe Kurtenbach’s</a> old-fashioned, clean-cut look? The 1940s never go out of style. <em><strong>Editor’s Note: Upon further review, we're not even sure that Mark CAN grow a beard. If he ever does, though, we're confident that it would be both stylish and well-groomed.</strong></em>



<strong>Less Drama, More Know-How</strong>

A lot of Duck Dynasty revolves around the “drama” the Robertson family faces as it goes about its daily business. Whether the central story in a given week is about Jase slacking off (which encompasses about 85 percent of the show’s episodes), or Willie’s descent into yuppiedom, it tends to be driven by the often-exaggerated drama that a network like A&amp;E will look for in a show. ARTV, meanwhile, delivers a lot more know-how. We deliver reviews and insight from the finest minds in the firearms industry, and nothing else. Certainly no looks into our hosts’ personal lives. OK, so maybe Mark Keefe is often a nervous wreck lamenting his son’s lacrosse team, and maybe he does spend countless hours muttering to himself as he stares at the over-sized team depth chart on his wall. And maybe Joe Kurtenbach and Aaron Carter do have a particularly vicious off-camera rivalry that dates back to an ownership dispute over the recipe that won last year’s inter-departmental chili contest. But we can’t just… Wait a minute-why aren’t we showing you folks this stuff? I apologize: This one’s on us, and I’m going to go ahead and take this entire bullet point back.



<strong>Mark. Keefe.</strong>

One of ARTV’s biggest draws is-or at least should be-its venerable host, Mark Keefe (or, as he demands to be called by his subordinates at NRA Headquarters, <em>Mark IV</em>). This is a man that eats, sleeps and breathes firearms. Companies call him for insight on new products. Friends call him for ammo. The ladies call him for dates (as a married man, he graciously declines). And, much like Robertson patriarch Phil, Mark has a nigh-legendary athletic background. You’re looking at a bonafied former Bocce ball prodigy right here. Sure, Phil “had NFL offers,” but Mark was the man that was going to take Bocce to the next level in the United States. He was going to do for Bocce ball what Bobby Fischer did for chess-and only walked away from it so he could bring the industry’s finest firearms coverage to you, his dedicated fans. This guy’s a real gamer, too-he once nearly died of smoke inhalation during a World War I reenactment. That’s dedication to realism, right there. Oh, and above all, Mark’s a snappy dresser: The last time this guy was spotted without a collar on his shirt, Jimmy Carter was still shilling peanuts out of the White House.



<strong>In Conclusion…</strong>

If you aren’t already frantically searching for re-runs of American Rifleman TV, I’ve failed. If that’s the case, I apologize. Seriously, though-the Rifleman folks do a fantastic job putting the show together, and we think that any firearms enthusiast would enjoy what the program has to offer.



Oh, and, just as a declaimer: The jokes in this piece were largely tongue in cheek (except the bit about Mark Keefe; that guy’s a boss). We love the Robertson crew, and Duck Dynasty is a fantastic show. We’d never fault anyone for watching it.



You know you could save it to the DVR and watch ARTV in real-time, though. And that’s a fact, jack…]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I watch both shows.  Please don't bag on DD just because you share the same time slot.  DD is a great family show.  ARTV is also a great show that I enjoy.  Of course ARTV is more about the guns, it's a gun show.  Hence the name.  DD is about the Robertson family.  Even though the scripted patrs are a little tiresome at times, I still love it.  Keep up the great work on ARTV and keep the this old gun segment coming.  What I could do without is all the commercials.  But thats where you make you money so Iunderstand that, but thre semms to be alot.<!--mobile-->]]></comment_content>

'I really cannot believe I am reading this article. I am stunned.'
'Outdoor TV is a part of a higher premier package $$$, Duck Dynasty is in the regular package of programming! SORRY! Get your program on a regular tier of programming and I'll watch ARTV also!'
'NRA-AR, You stepped in it and walked it all over the carpet with this one. Bashing a Firearm and Christian, family show is no bueno.'
'It's sad to see such a cut throat attitude when division is one of the problems today. I don't appreciate the bashing of duck dynasty I would of expected better from the NRA.'
'I can't believe you all did this article. I'm pretty sure I have seen NRA stickers on some of their trucks plus I know they support the NRA. Their show was never supposed to be all about hunting. This one is going to come back and bite you in the butt.']]>

    <title>Hornady&#039;s Critical Defense Triple Threat .410 Shotshell</title>

      <![CDATA[There hasn't been much talk recently about new .45 Colt/.410 handguns arriving on the market. However, the popularity of guns like the <a title="Learn more about the Judge. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=14971&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=23" target="_blank">Taurus Judge</a>, <a title="Read the full story on the Governor." href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13663&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=23" target="_blank">Smith &amp; Wesson Governor</a> and the Bond Arms Snake Slayer have inspired ammunition companies to provide customers with shotshells specially designed to perform in the short, rifled barrels of handguns. <a href="http://federalpremium.com/" target="_blank">Federal</a>, <a href="http://remington.com/" target="_blank">Remington</a> and <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester</a> all have fingers in this particular .410 pie, and so <a href="http://www.hornady.com/" target="_blank">Hornady</a> has stepped up to the plate with a new .410 handgun shotshell unlike anything else currently available.



The Hornady Critical Defense 2 ½-inch .410 Triple Threat shotshell contains a mixed payload, unlike the buckshot loads that are loaded with three, four or five lead balls of the same diameter. The first projectile in the Hornady shell is a .41-caliber 115-grain FTX lead slug. The un-jacketed slug's hollow-point nose is filled with a red polymer plug, just like the copper jacketed FTX bullets used in the standard pistol-caliber cartridges of the Critical Defense line. The slug is followed by two .35-caliber lead balls weighing in at 65 grains each, which means they are slightly smaller and lighter than 000 buckshot pellets. This makes for a total of 245-grains of lead to throw downrange, which is about 15-grains more than a standard .45 ACP FMJ bullet at a published velocity of 750 feet-per-second (fps).



But here is an important question: Why does Hornady, or any company for that matter, need to design .410 shells specifically for handguns? Wouldn’t any .410 shell of correct length for the chamber do the trick? This need for handgun-specific shotshells is actually driven by a bit of government policy.



The most efficient handgun for shooting .410 shells would have a smooth-bore barrel sized to fit that shell only. However, sawed-off shotguns and smooth-bore pistols have been restricted in this country for some time due to NFA regulations established in 1934. In order for a handgun to qualify for over-the-counter sale without additional Federal tax stamps and paperwork, it must have a rifled barrel and be chambered for a center-fire cartridge intended for handguns or rifles.



Therefore, the reason .45 Colt/.410 handguns are legal to buy over-the-counter (in most States) is because they are designed as .45 Colt pistols first, and as .410s second. In other words, the barrels are bored and rifled to fire the .452 to .454 caliber bullets of .45 Colt cartridges in order to meet NFA requirements, but the chambers are lengthened to accept shotshells. Meeting these legal requirements creates a functional gap between the two calibers. Sending .410-caliber projectiles from a shotshell down a .45-bore revolver barrel leaves a meaningful amount of airspace around the projectiles which in turn affects long-range accuracy. What may seem like absent minded gun design is actually a concession to Federal law.



Various ammunition companies strive to bridge the .45 Colt barrel/.41-caliber projectile gap in different ways. Hornady tackled the problem with the Triple Threat .410 shell. Along with having a hollow point, the relatively long and heavy (compared to buck shot) FTX slug has a hollow base. As the shell is fired, the two lead balls press into this hollow to cause the base of the slug to flair out and contact the rifling of the barrel. The goal is to have the slug produce the point-of-aim accuracy and expansion of a hollow-point bullet, with the lead balls spreading apart to create the pattern of a buckshot load. So how well does it work?



The Hornady Triple Defense shot shell was test fired through a set of six .45 Colt/.410 handguns and one .410 bore shotgun for pattern, penetration and performance testing. Just in case you're wondering, the answer is yes the Triple Defense shell can be safely fired in most .410 shotguns, including those with full chokes. Because this round is advertised as a self-defense shotshell, all of the test guns used were designed for personal protection or concealed carry.



Slug and ball patterns for each firearm were captured using two <a href="http://birchwoodcasey.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Birchwood Casey</a> Shoot-N-C 12x18-inch silhouette targets, one up close, with one further out, to obtain the spread of the projectiles over distance. It should be noted here that .410-capable handguns cause the patterns of birdshot, buckshot and mixed payload .410 shells to open up very quickly compared to .410 long guns. While an 18.5-inch barrel combat shotgun in 12 gauge, 20 gauge or .410 bore can produce something like a 7-inch shot pattern at 21 feet (7 yards), some .410 handgun and ammunition combinations can produce 7-inch patterns in as little as 6 feet. The patterns produced with the Triple Threat were tight enough to provide representative test targets out to 10 feet and 15 feet for handguns, and 15 to 20 feet for the shotgun.



To check for projectile penetration and performance, single rounds were fired into bare <a href="http://clearballistics.com/" target="_blank">Clear Ballistics</a> FBI-sized synthetic gel blocks from a distance of 10 feet. Projectile expansion was checked using Sinclair digital calipers, and weight retention was verified with a Hornady GS-1500 electronic scale, both from <a href="http://www.brownells.com/" target="_blank">Brownells</a>.



So once the smoke cleared, how did Hornady's new Critical Defense 410 Triple Defense shotshell measure up? It demonstrated positive qualities in several areas, but mixed results in others. The shell proved to be reliable. It successfully fed, fired and ejected from a wide variety of guns with no malfunctions or failures. Function testing included several gun models that were not listed as part of this test.



The mixed-payload pattern testing has to be judged within the context of the firearms used. The .45 Colt/.410 handgun platforms are short-range personal-protection options. This means defensive .410 shotshells usually provide their best performance at around 7 yards or less. Much beyond 7 yards (depending on the load fired), the shot pattern becomes too large or the projectiles lose too much energy to be effective. This is the major trade-off of choosing this particular type of two-caliber handgun. It can launch multiple projectiles with one pull of the trigger, but at the cost of long-range accuracy and energy.



To even the playing field between the very shortest barrels (2-inches or less), the standard 3-inch barrels and the 18.5-inch shotgun, each gun had one of the two targets set at 5 yards to create a baseline. At this distance, patterns ranged from 1.25 to 3.5 inches in size, with the tightest single group of 1.25 inches produced by the standard-size Taurus Judge with a 2½-inch chamber and 3-inch barrel. Informal testing out to 7 yards demonstrated that every gun model tested could keep all three projectiles center-of-mass.



The Clear Ballistics gel testing demonstrated that relatively small changes in handgun barrel length may significantly alter the Triple Threat's slug and ball penetration levels. The most shallow three-projectile penetration distances (8.85, 7.75 and 7.25 inches) were produced by the 2-inch barrel of the Polymer Public Defender version of the Taurus Judge. However, the best handgun penetration (15, 12.25 and 10.25 inches) came from the 3-inch barrel of a standard sized Judge. To meet FBI standards, a projectile needs to produce a minimum of 12 inches of penetration in ballistic gel. Of the seven guns used in this limited gel test (one shot per block per gun), two had no projectiles reach 12 inches, five had one slug or ball hit or pass the 12-inch mark, three guns had two projectiles make the grade, but only one gun, the shotgun, pushed all three projectiles past 12 inches.



Those slugs or balls that satisfied the FBI’s 12-inch minimum distance requirements created what could be considered primary wound channels. The secondary wound channels caused by the other projectiles showed penetration distances ranging from 6 to 11.5 inches in depth. Although these secondary wound tracks don't meet the FBI grade, having two perforations at these depths added to the primary impact is nothing to laugh at.



Lastly we have the slug and ball performance results. The recovered pellets all held together nicely in gel, with the recovered projectiles retaining between 98 to 100 percent of their unfired weight. The lead balls showed some flattening, but not much. The most dramatic FTX slug expansions were produced by the Mossberg shotgun and, once again, the standard-sized Taurus Judge. In the shotgun, it looks like one ball and the slug slammed into each other causing both to be deformed. Unfortunately, the overall performance of the FTX slugs was disappointing. Take a look at this photo of the recovered slugs:



<a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/H3T_UpsetCompB1_s_web.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-25362" title="H3T_UpsetCompB1_s_web" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/H3T_UpsetCompB1_s_web-300x143.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="143" /></a>



The hollow bases of the FTX slugs from this batch of shells did not expand enough to engage the rifling of the handgun barrels, which is the purpose of the slug’s design. In fact, the slugs displayed no rifling marks at all. Checking the base expansion with digital calipers confirmed what the visual inspection implied. No slug base expanded more than .444 inches when fired from a handgun, which means they were unlikely to engage the lands and grooves of a barrel designed for .454-inch .45 Colt bullets.



The polymer-tipped hollow points of the slugs showed very little to no expansion in five of the seven guns tested. In a few cases the unexpanded slug stopped in the gel facing backwards (tip toward the shooter). Was this dual failure to expand a fluke or a flaw? I've seen the same photos and gel tests, with fully expanded FTX Slugs, as everyone else. So what was the problem in this case? I can't say for sure. The rounds used for these tests were some of the very first Triple Threat loads off of the production line. Were the slugs in this batch made of a harder lead alloy? Were the powder charges off a bit? Or does Hornady have to go back and take another look at the design? Only time will tell for sure.



So, is the performance of the new Hornady Triple Threat .410 shotshell up to snuff? Based on these tests, it seems likely that the Triple Threat shell has been optimized for use in the Taurus Judge 2½-inch chamber, 3-inch barrel revolver. It also performs well when fired from a defensive shotgun. However, other short-barrel handguns may or may not produce sufficient levels of performance for self-defense. If Hornady can adjust the FTX slugs to expand fully at the base of the slug, then this round has the potential to become a top contender in this handgun ammunition class.

At 21 feet or less [(]the standard for 'legitimate' use of deadly force[)] the .45 Colt is a FAR better option tna any .410 as a defensive load; and the lighter projectiles thrown by the shotshell [(]regardless of make or type[)] are always going to have less penetration than the 250-grain bullet of the .45 Colt.  These guns, all of them, are pretty much gimmicks: given the weight and size of even a polymer-framed .410/.45, someone would be far better served carrying a titanium-framed Taurus revolver in .45 Colt, or a Charter Bulldog in .44 Special.  If you can't hit a man 7 yards away with a single projectile, spewing a few small ones from a 'shotgun' isn't likely to solve your problems.  The only 'practical' use for a pistol/shotgun hybrid is as a defense against snakes.  Here, a .38 or .45 loaded with shotshells is as good or better; but I have one of those single-shot 'Leinad'' derringers in .410/.45 in my tackle box for this purpose.  By the way, with the .45 Colt its recoil is so great as to make me almost drop it.  With the .410 and #7-1/2 or #9 it will do a snake.  But a human?  No way would I choose one of these guns--any of these guns--for a defensive piece.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Excellent post, NRV. The idea that someone would go to all the trouble of hauling one of these things around just to shoot .45 Colts makes absolutely no sense; their primary function is to shoot shot shells, and only at very close range before velocity is lost and their patterns open up to the point of being worthless. From these tests and others available on the Internet, the myth of having 'shotgun power' available in a handgun is destroyed. At the short ranges these revolvers are used, there is an absence of overwhelming stopping power, deep penetration, and large holes, the three requirements of a great self-defense weapon. If forced to use one, I would load up with #6 shot and aim for the face. But don't forget that the patterns are tight at close range so you still have to be capable of hitting your target as if you were firing a single projectile.  And if we are that good of a shot, we could just bring a .22 and make head shots. I know two men who have bought one of these revolvers for their wife to carry in her purse or tummy pack, the idea being that she would simply let loose a cloud of shot in the general direction of the bad guy and he would immediately expire, as if ripped apart by a blast from a 12-gauge shotgun. Nobody seemed to mind that probably 90[%] of the shot would miss the target and continue downrange. It must be that some folks have so many guns at home they are desperately looking for a new one, something different, to add to their collection.  Why else would an otherly-rational person buy one?]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[One version of the old Minie ball had a wood sabot in the rear cavity, to expand the base into the rifling.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[So I have the S&W .45/.410 and I love it for both carry and home defense because of its versatility. However I am a big guy who doesn't mind a heavy gun. I like to try out different types of ammo. When I tried out Hornady Triple Defense .410 I liked the pattern however I had a serious problem with unloading the spent cartridge. I needed pliers to remove 2 of the 6 shells. I have never had this problem with any other .410 round and noticed in the article that it performed without problem for you. Did I get a bad box or has any one else experienced this?  As of right now I would never trust this round for use if it takes 2 or 3 minutes to unload it. <!--mobile-->]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Diesel, you have pointed out the exact reason why every self defense load has to be thoroughly tested in a carry gun before using it. Subtle differences in each gun's dimensions can cause problems. A round that works just fine in one gun may malfunction in another. Never assume that because a buddy or a gun reviewer had no problems with a round in their gun that it will work in yours.  Always test it in the gun its actually going to be carried in to make sure its reliable. ]]></comment_content>

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://redfield.com/" target="_blank">Redfield</a> has jumped into the rimfire scope market with its Battlezone Tac.22 2-7x34 mm riflescope.



Designed for .22 Long Rifle firearms, the Battlezone Tac.22 comes with two elevation adjustment dials. The first is marked in ¼ MOA increments, while the second is a Bullet Drop Compensation (BDC) dial calibrated to a 36-grain, .22LR hollow point traveling at 1,260 fps. The BDC dial is marked from 50 to 150 yards.



The Battlezone Tac.22 features the Tac-MOA reticle, which matches the ¼ MOA adjustment dials. Stadia lines on the horizontal and vertical crosshairs are set at two minute of angle increments, allowing for fast windage and bullet drop adjustments, as well as range estimation. Parallax is set at a rimfire-friendly 75 yards.



Its fully multi-coated lens deliver excellent brightness, clarity and resolution, while the fast-focus eyepiece provides an exceptional field of view, and makes focus fast and easy in the field. Aggressively knurled, resettable adjustment dials feature audible clicks that assure precision, repeatability and a wide range of adjustment travel.



Like all Redfield optics, the Battlezone Tac.22 is nitrogen-filled for a lifetime of waterproof, fog proof and shock proof performance, and it is covered by the Redfield “No Excuses” warranty.]]>

      <![CDATA[There’s nothing funny about the NSA <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-collects-millions-of-e-mail-address-books-globally/2013/10/14/8e58b5be-34f9-11e3-80c6-7e6dd8d22d8f_story.html?Post+generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost" target="_blank">collecting contact lists</a> and information from Internet sites, so pardon my lack of humor. Americans are being targeted, and the administration <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/25/kerry-signs-un-arms-treaty-senators-threaten-to-block-it/" target="_blank">signed</a> a U.N. Gun Treaty with serious ramifications to the Second Amendment last month.



The sky isn’t falling, but the cloud cover is getting pretty low for gun owners. No one in their right mind cares if the NSA can efficiently mine the Internet for information that could stop a terrorist attack, but it doesn’t take a brain surgeon to figure out one of the keyword searches they’re using is “firearm.”



OK, the offshore sites doing this may have turned up my post about the antique <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blogs/too-valuable-for-the-safe" target="_blank">Stevens shotgun</a> I inherited. Odds are good the “lead” would have been deleted, unless of course it hit the desk of someone who doesn’t know guns, or a person in a bad mood, or an overworked snoop who missed the delete key while scouring 44,000 e-mail addresses from Yahoo on that single day.



I don’t have much to hide, so I’m not overly concerned. But then again, I don’t have plans to vacation in any of our anti-gun NATO ally nations-who for all I know will have unlimited access to cyberspace’s mother lode. But when a parent’s innocent firearm-related <a href="http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/familys-home-raided-over-facebook-photo-of-childs-rifle.html" target="_blank">post on Facebook </a> results in a visit from child protective services, it may be time to rethink some things.



Do I really want a snot-nosed, wet-behind-the-ears kid whose sole claim to fame is top-score in Tetris trying to figure out if my 100-year-old 12-gauge shotgun should be of concern?  I haven’t quite figured that one out yet.



On one hand it scares me. No more annual holiday cards with the grandkids guarding the house while wearing reindeer camo. No more hunting photos, new gun announcements, ammo shortage complaints or sharing of the daily prayer. Let’s face facts: Privacy settings are just a suggestion to government hackers.



On the other hand, I think it’s too late for me. If you’re in the same boat, why not annoy the heck out of them with so much garbage it makes their heads spin, like on the Exorcist-odd that movie comes to mind right now.]]>

    <title>New From Remington</title>

      <![CDATA[In 2016, <a href="http://www.remington.com/" target="_blank">Remington</a> will have been providing quality firearms to the public for 200 years. And while the company still produces some of the most popular firearms on the market, it is not resting on its success with the 700, 1100 and 870.



In the next few months, Remington, along with other segments of the Freedom Group of Companies, will be introducing a few new products, as well as new variations of previous models. One of the more interesting bits of news coming from Big Green is that the company is bringing out the <a href="http://shoot2020.com/" target="_blank">Remington 2020</a>, a digital optic system that is paired with hand-selected rifles and sighted at the factory. The system features a 3-21 power scope, along with a laser rangefinder, video camera, ballistic calculator, WiFi server, still camera, compass and barometer. The system is a collaboration between Remington and <a href="https://tracking-point.com/" target="_blank">TrackingPoint</a>, combining digital optics with target tracking technology. This system can record shots, both video and photos, which can then be shared with others via the server.



Available in three versions-700 SPS Tactical in .308 Win., 700 Long Range in .30-06 Sprg. and a <a href="http://www.bushmaster.com/index.asp" target="_blank">Bushmaster</a> Varmiter in .223 Rem., the Remington 2020 provides long-range shooting capabilities, and can track targets moving up to 10 m.p.h. The system comes with 300 rounds of ammunition, with which it is specifically paired for optimal accuracy, though there will probably be updates that will allow customization to other types of ammunition, including handloads. The only drawback is the more than $5,000 price tag.



Other offerings include the 700 Tactical Chassis in .308 Win., .300 Win. and .338 Lapua Mag., and a 700 VTR that comes with a bipod, scope and tactical bolt knob for only an additional $25, or a stainless version for an extra $72.



In the shotgun markets, Remington is coming out with few new versions of the <a title="Read more about the Versa Max. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=14359&amp;cat=13&amp;sub=14" target="_blank">Versa Max</a>-the Wood Tech, the Waterfowl Pro and the Left Hand, as well as one designed for 3-gun competition.



Finally, Remington is entering the airgun market with a rifle called the Express, which will be in stores for the Holiday shopping season.

    <title>NRA National Defense Match Weekend a Resounding Success </title>

      <![CDATA[More than 100 NRA members braved the rain to participate in three NRA National Defense Matches hosted at the <a href="http://peacemakernational.com/" target="_blank">Peacemaker National Training Center</a> in Glengary, W.Va., over the October 12-13 weekend.



National Defense Matches are competitive, recreational and training events designed to develop and test defensive rifle skills with modern, general-purpose rifles, such as the extraordinarily popular AR‑15. The matches held at Peacemaker included a basic-level event calling for shots and reloads from a variety of positions, at distances between 7 and 100 yards, as well as two advanced events conducted on multiple firing bays and natural terrain, with cardboard targets at distances ranging from 3 to approximately 50 yards, and steel targets at various distances out to 600 yards.



During breaks in the action, shooting demonstrations were conducted by world-renown competition and exhibition shooter Jerry Miculek, tactical firearm instructor Jack Leuba, Colt 3-gun competitor Scott McGregor and <a href="http://www.advanced-armament.com/" target="_blank">Advanced Armament Corporation</a>, a manufacturer of world class firearm suppressors.



After the raising of the American flag to the National Anthem to begin the weekend’s opening ceremony, guest of honor Jim Warner spoke about the importance of protecting the right to keep and bear arms. Warner, a former Marine Corps aviator, spent five and a half years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam, and upon his return to the United States served in President Ronald Reagan’s administration and later in the National Rifle Association’s Office of General Counsel.



The matches will be covered on the <a href="http://outdoorchannel.com/" target="_blank">Outdoor Channel</a> by <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=25108&amp;cat=3&amp;sub=4" target="_blank">American Rifleman TV</a> later this year or in early 2014, and by NRA membership magazines shortly thereafter. In the meantime, <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/galleries/national-defense-match-gallery">check out the gallery of images</a> from the match.]]>

    <title>Weatherby-X Vanguard GH2</title>

      <![CDATA[When riflemen or hunters hear the name <a href="http://www.weatherby.com/" target="_blank">Weatherby</a>, high-end rifles with high-end price tags often come to mind. The reality is that for more than 40 years Weatherby has offered a value-priced rifle called the Vanguard. Vanguard rifles remained virtually unchanged until 2011, at which point the Series 2, with many updated features, was introduced. Among Weatherby’s new for 2013 Vanguard introductions was the Girls Hunt 2 (GH2) model, which is found exclusively in the new Weatherby-X line. The Vanguard GH2, specifically, is styled and sized for female shooters, though it will likely appeal most to those in the younger demographic.



The Vanguard Series 2’s action, which is built for Weatherby by Howa, serves as the heart of the Weatherby-X GH2 rifles. The push-feed action is essentially a copy of the old and excellent Sako L61R action. It’s a tubular action that has been drilled and tapped for scope bases and has a recoil lug machined into the front of the receiver. The bolt has dual-opposed locking lugs and a plunger ejector. Extraction is via an Sako-style extractor. The Vanguard GH2 models come with a hinged floor plate.



Many custom builders turn up their nose at Vanguard actions due to their Japanese origin, others recognize the features and build fine rifles on the action anyway. From a practical standpoint, the only reason they are avoided is due to the metric threads used for barrel attachment. It requires additional equipment and there is a learning curve associated when working with metric threads. If there’s any doubt as to the serviceability and practicality of the Vanguard action, consider that the custom rifles from <a href="http://www.nosler.com/" target="_blank">Nosler</a> are almost an exact copy of the Vanguard.



Weatherby’s GH2 version of the Vanguard is purpose-built for small-stature shooters, specifically women. To build a rifle to this criterion, Weatherby chose to utilize a slim-contour barrel and to chamber the rifles only in short-action cartridges sized similar to the .308 Win. case, as well as .223 Rem.



The stock is injection-molded with the traditional Weatherby high comb and cheekpiece on the left side. An identically stocked youth model is available with a black stock but the GH2 series rifle stock is black with pink webbing. Both are dimensionally identical, but the more colorful Weatherby-X series focuses on female tastes and comes with a price tag of $150 more. Another feature was added to the GH2 and that’s the synthetic stock with an adjustable length of pull, which comes set at 12½ inches. But here’s the special part; each GH2 rifle is shipped with a spacer that perfectly matches the shape and finish of the stock. By removing the buttpad and inserting the spacer the length of pull can be increased to 1313⁄16 inches. This means the rifle should fit ladies who are short or tall and, if they are young, it can grow with them.



Proof of concept was established when a woman no taller than five foot, four inches when wearing heels shouldered the rifle-without the stock spacer-and proclaimed, “This fits.” Range work from the bench and from various unsupported positions further verified the design theory. Proper eye relief and trigger reach was always maintained. The lady shot well and that can be attributed to the excellent shooter interface-fit, sights and trigger-offered by the rifle.



The short length of pull is an obvious interface mandate when trying to match a rifle to a shooter who is small. But there’s more to it. The high comb on the stock allows for proper head positioning behind the sights. That is especially critical with women, who tend to have longer necks. With the scope mounted 1.5 inches above the centerline of the bore, proper eye positioning and a comfortable cheek weld were maintained from the bench and field positions.



Another important consideration in the shooter interface equation is trigger pull. Vanguard Series 2 rifles have a two-stage trigger that exhibits about an 1/8 inch of take-up. After take-up, only 2 pounds, 12 ounces of force is required to release the sear. And, after sear release there’s only about 1/16 inch of over-travel. It is a good trigger and allowed the petite lady to shoot the rifle very well.



Weatherby guarantees its Vanguard GH2 rifles will place three shots into a 1-inch group at 100 yards when quality loads are used. For testing, a <a href="http://nightforceoptics.com/" target="_blank">Nightforce</a> NSX 2.5-10X 32 mm Compact was installed and, while firing the mandated five-shot groups, the first three shots of each group also were evaluated. With the exception of six of the 15 groups fired, all met the three-shot, 1-inch standard.



The <a href="http://www.barnesbullets.com/" target="_blank">Barnes</a> 80-grain load and the rifle were not the best combination. None of the first three shots fired with this load clustered inside an inch. This should not be considered a failure; all rifles are a bit picky when it comes to ammunition. And, at any rate, any production rifle averaging 1.5 inches for 15 groups fired with ammunition picked at random, shoots very well.



The Weatherby-X Vanguard GH2 rifle deserves serious consideration if you’re looking for a rifle for a young lady or even an adult woman. It is likely to fit and appeal to their modern, feminine lifestyle as well. And, like any male shooter, a female is likely to perform better and enjoy the experience more if her rifle fits her properly.

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://bushnell.com/" target="_blank">Bushnell</a> has introduced a 3x30 digital night-vision device in its Equinox series. The 3x30mm Equinox night vision monocular uses digital technology to provide crisp, clear images, and a dual output mode that allows users to display images in either green or black and white at the push of a button.



The green display is ideal for almost-dark to completely dark conditions, while the black and white display is best when some ambient light is available, either at dusk or dawn or under bright moonlight.



Built with a rugged, water-resistant housing that meets IPX-4 waterproof specifications, the Equinox series offers all-weather performance. The Equinox also provides a comfortable viewing experience with two integrated polarized filters that defuse the light intensity to make it more natural to the eye.



The Equinox devices are tripod mountable and include integrated accessory rails that facilitate the addition of an IR light to dramatically extend the viewing range for a suggested retail price of $329.99.]]>

      <![CDATA[Part of my Saturday routine used to be cruising the gun stores in Orange County, Calif., where I lived and worked. About once a month, I also made the big loop up into Los Angeles County and visited places like The Pony Express, Kerr’s in Beverly Hills, Martin B. Retting, King’s Gun Works and Pachmayr. The latter place had been there for many years and was the source for a product used by about half the cops I knew.



It was the <a href="http://www.pachmayr.com/home/revolver-grips.php" target="_blank">Pachmayr</a> grip, colloquially referred to as simply “Packies.” In that period, the revolver was king and almost no police agency authorized any kind of semi-auto handgun. Most officers chose some form of K frame S&amp;W, with a sprinkling of N frames and Colts of several types. The grips installed by either factory were OK and underwent periodic improvements, but most guys wanted a little more contact surface for recoil control. Most of all, they needed a bit of a filler block behind the trigger guard.



Very often, they solved the gunhandling problem with a pair of grips moulded from a firm rubber substance and shaped for minimum bulk. Thus equipped, most revolvers were considerably easier to manage. Many times, I helped my fellow deputies with their shooting, and often my advice included installing a pair of Packies. For $20 or so, these grips helped mightily with learning a new and unfamiliar skill. A few years later, Metallic Silhouette shooting came along and a great many competitors installed Packies on their revolvers or Contenders. It was, and is, a valuable product in the shooting world.



When all of this was going on, the products came from a small plant just a few blocks from the Civic Center in downtown Los Angeles. They had a great old gun store nearby that had all kinds of stuff that appealed to folks of many stripes. This Custom gunsmithing operation made everything from bullseye pistols to high-end shotguns and safari rifles. Interestingly, Pachmayr bought another rubber grip company that dated back before World War II. Mershon 10-point grips were also respectable products, except when they aged and turned harder than Vermont marble. Happily enough, the original Packies are still made, along with a number of other products in the original Pachmayr line. Look at the <a href="http://www.lymanproducts.com/lyman/main/" target="_blank">Lyman</a> website.]]>

        <![CDATA[Ps. I had a flash back when you mentioned The Pony Express gun store. I used to live in walking distance until they called it quits after the Brady bill passed along with the state and L.A. anti-gun bills. I also enjoy all of your posts and have learned a lot from them. Thanks for all of your insight.

    <title>Store Changes its Tune</title>

      <![CDATA[There are a lot of stores that are concerned about its customers carrying concealed handguns inside their buildings. Because of a contested concealed-carry law change in my home state of Mississippi, my local Wal-Mart has posted its building-meaning no customers with concealed handguns are permitted inside.



I’ve often wondered if these stores would continue this type of policy if a robbery situation was stopped by a permit holder who ignored the sign. Well that was revealed when two armed men walked into an Aldi grocery store in Milwaukee, Wis., with the intent on robbing the place. The robbery was stopped when a customer pulled a concealed handgun and shot one of the suspects, who then fled the scene. Even though the store was posted, the citizen was not charged in the incident.



Since this incident, Aldi has supposedly reversed its policy of prohibiting firearms in its stores, according to numerous <a href="http://forum.opencarry.org/forums/showthread.php?106721-Aldi-s-reverses-policy-no-longer-prohibiting-weapons" target="_blank">firearm forums</a> that have posted a letter from the company stating the recent policy change. All I truly know, however, is that my local Aldi does not a sign prohibiting the carrying of concealed firearms.]]>

    <title>NRA National Sporting Arms Museum Opens Serial Number One Guns Exhibit</title>

      <![CDATA[The National Rifle Association announces the opening of Serial Number One Guns, a new exhibit in the NRA National Sporting Arms Museum at the <a href="http://www.basspro.com/" target="_blank">Bass Pro Shops</a> flagship superstore in Springfield, Mo.



Serial Number One Guns features 29 firearms, from the cap and ball percussion arms of the mid 1800s to a modern polymer-frame semi-automatic pistol, sporting a serial number of “1.” The exhibit includes notable pieces such as a Smith &amp; Wesson Schofield, Colt .40 caliber Model 1851 Navy, Springfield Sharps Model 1870 and more.



“We are proud to share this special collection of firearms with the visitors of the NRA National Sporting Arms Museum,” said Museum Director Jim Supica. “Individually, the exhibit’s guns mark first steps in firearm technology. Together, they trace the history of industrialized firearms manufacturing.”



A serial number of “1” most often indicates the first gun of a particular model; however it may represent a “batch number” in firearms produced before unique serial numbers were mandated in the Gun Control Act of 1968. Serial numbers may still differ between prototype or pre-production samples and production models. Additionally, manufacturers have been known to create custom numbers in cases of VIP customers.



The <a href="http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/FullCMSContentView?storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;path=nra-museum-7594&amp;fileName=nra-index&amp;cm_ven=redirect&amp;cm_cat=mktg&amp;cm_pla=bps&amp;cm_ite=nramuseum&amp;cm_sp=NRAMuseumJul2013_RD" target="_blank">NRA National Sporting Arms Museum</a> is the result of a partnership between Bass Pro Shops and the NRA. Home to more than a thousand firearms; the 7,500-square foot museum focuses on the history of hunting, conservation and freedom. Visitors can see this one-of-a-kind collection at 1935 S. Campbell in Springfield, Mo. The museum is open every day from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. and admission is free.]]>

      <![CDATA[Spanish-made Bergara barrels have a good reputation for performance, and the company’s U.S. branch produces several models of rifles for uses ranging from hunting to tactical. Bergara’s production manager is former Marine Dan Hanus, who before retirement served at Quantico as the Production Chief and Chief Instructor for the Marine Corps Precision Weapons Section. The Long-Range Hunter (BCR15) rifle certainly reflects his background, fitting right into the present American style of such specialized guns.



The BCR15’s stock is the McMillan A-3 Sporter, featuring a vertical pistol grip, a non-adjustable cheekpiece, and a lighter fill than McMillan’s adjustable tactical stocks. The stock comes in an olive/tan/black “marble” camouflage, with a black Pachmayr Decelerator recoil pad installed. There is an extra sling swivel stud on the fore-end for attaching a bipod.



The Bergara Custom action is pillar-bedded with steel-filled Marine-Tex epoxy, and the 24-inch barrel is free-floated. The barrel’s diameter at the muzzle, just behind the optional KDF muzzle brake, measures 0.725 inches. All the metal, including the steel Badger M4 bottom metal with hinged floorplate, features a black nitride finish for extreme weather resistance. The wide, oval trigger guard has enough room for a forefinger in a medium-weight glove, and the floorplate release is a slightly raised flat inside the guard, which is impossible to trip accidentally.



The BCR15’s advertised weight is 8 pounds, 8 ounces. The test rifle came with a 4-16X 50 mm Vortex Viper mounted on Bergara’s 20-m.o.a. Picatinny rail, which is standard on the BCR15 and is both screwed and pinned to the action for stability. With the scope and mounts the rifle weighed 10 pounds, 1 ounce, a good compromise between portability and stability for this sort of specialized hunting rifle.



The action is typical of modern long-range bolt rifles, a push-feed design whose bolt has two forward-mounted, horizontally opposed lugs, it also has a plunger ejector, toggle Sako-style extractor, spirally fluted bolt and extra-long bolt handle. Like many such actions, it has a Remington Model 700 “footprint,” and in fact a 700 short action slipped easily into the stock.



Bergara uses both Timney and Shilen triggers with trigger blocking, two-position safeties-the bolt handle can still be manipulated on “safe.” The safety lever is positioned just to the right of the bolt shroud, exactly where it is on the Remington 700.  Our test rifle’s Timney trigger broke crisply at 3 pounds.



Removing the stock from the barrel action revealed a perfect bedding job, with the oversize recoil lug fully bedded on all sides. The bottom of the barrel channel is hollowed, and the washers for the sling swivel studs also appeared to be attached with Marine-Tex.



The initial test-shooting took place on a warm summer morning with a mild breeze from the left measuring 2-5 m.p.h. on a Minox Windwatch, with occasional “gusts” to eight. (The shooter attempted to miss the gusts, but sometimes got caught.) The BCR15 was sighted-in using a handload with 180-grain Hornady InterLock Spire Points that had shot well in other .300 WSMs. After three shots to foul the clean bore and get on paper at 100 yds., three more shots went into the same hole, the “group” measuring slightly under 0.1 inch center to center-certainly impressive performance!



Three factory loads were then shot in rotation, with the barrel cooled between the five consecutive, five-shot groups fired with each load. The rifle didn’t much care for Federal’s Vital-Shok 165-grain Trophy Bonded Tip, a bullet that usually shoots pretty well, but did much better with NormaUSA American PH ammo featuring its 165-grain Oryx bonded bullet.



It also eventually grouped very well with Nosler’s Trophy Grade load with the 180-grain AccuBond. The Federal and Norma groups remained about the same size throughout the shooting, but the Nosler groups continually shrank, the first measuring more than 2 inches and the last 0.94 inches, the smallest of the test, with the last three groups averaging slightly more than 1 inch.



After the groups, more shooting was done with the Harris bipod provided, and point of impact didn’t change. After close to 100 rounds fired and a few brush strokes to remove most propellant residue, a Hawkeye bore-scope revealed only tiny hints of copper fouling in the very smooth bore. According to the Bergara website the barrels are not lapped, like many other custom barrels; instead, after drilling the initial hole the bores are honed, rather than reamed, leaving a very smooth finish before being button-rifled. In the Hawkeye the bore resembled exactly the hundreds of lapped bores I’ve scoped through the years-with just as little fouling.



The next morning several groups were shot at 400 yards in a mild following breeze of 2-4 m.p.h., since, after all, the rifle is intended for longer ranges, using the Nosler load since it had ended the 100-yard test so well. Three, three-shot groups (used because the ammo supply was limited) averaged 3.29 inches, pretty good for factory ammunition.



The only minor problem encountered with the rifle was loading the second round into the two-round magazine. The top of the sheet-steel magazine box has both front and rear lips. The rear lips fold over considerably to hold the fat .300 WSM rounds in the magazine, while the front lips are more open to allow the rounds to feed into the chamber. That meant the rear end of each round had to be inserted between the open front lips, then pushed to the rear of the magazine. That was pretty easy with the first round, but increased spring tension made loading the second round awkward, especially through a minimal cartridge port topped by the Picatinny rail. Otherwise the rifle performed great, and would be well worth consideration by any hunter looking for a long-range rifle, particularly for elk and similar game.

      <![CDATA[Why can’t we love the .35? That’s a question I just don’t understand.



By and large, we shooters seem to gravitate to the middle of the road; to bland, yet predictable, mediocrity. In rifle cartridges, we usually take the safe route and .30-caliber has emerged as the American shooter’s choice. The most popular cartridges for hunting and even target shooting begin and end with the thirties. Sure, we “experiment” a bit with other bore sizes, but in the end it always comes back to the .30 caliber. Moderate, safe, bland and predictable.



Sadly, my favorite bullet diameter, the .35 caliber, doesn’t even rate a blip on the American shooter’s radar screen. Yet, that bore diameter produces some of the best hunting cartridges available.



Of course, not all .35-caliber cartridges approach greatness. The quest for an acceptable .35 has inspired such impotent wastes as the .35 Winchester Self Loader, once labeled a candidate for the title: “World’s Most Useless Center-Fire Rifle Cartridge.”



Its spawn, the .351 Winchester Self Loader, fared a little better, but it was never in danger of greatness. It’s said that the French used it in World War I, but it probably didn’t see much action.



The .351 WSL did grab a bit of fame, first as a popular rifle for prison guards and then as one of the rifles used to punch a lot of holes in Bonnie and Clyde’s automobile (although that accolade is in question). I have one, of course, and it is fun to shoot, but I would never use it on a serious big-game hunt.



There have been many others, such as the .35-30 Maynard (both in the 1865 and the 1882 versions) and .35-40 Maynard. I’ll bet it’s been awhile since those cartridges have been seen in a hunting camp. The .35 Win., .35 Newton and .350 Griffin &amp; Howe Mag. all were more powerful-and may have been excellent hunting cartridges-but they are gone; rejected by the shooting public and banished to the junk heap of obsolescence. The sad truth is that the active list of current .35-caliber rifles and cartridges is tragically short.



<strong>.35 Remington</strong>

This stumpy little cartridge was introduced to the hunting public in 1908 and is the only surviving member of the early class of Remington rimless cartridges. It arrived with three other cartridges designed to compete with Winchester’s popular lever-action lineup. The .25 Rem., .30 Rem. and .32 Rem. were to go head to head with the .25-35 Win., .30-30 Win. and the .32 Win. Spl.



Why the .35 Rem. was included in that party is a mystery, as it had no Winchester counterpart. Perhaps that’s why it has survived. You can never lead if you always follow; the other cartridges were designed to chase Winchester’s success, while the .35 Rem. plowed fresh ground. The .35 Rem. was also the only cartridge of that original Remington family that was based on a different parent case.



The .35 Rem. was initially chambered in Remington’s Model 8 autoloader, soon followed by the Model 14 pump-action. In the years since, the .35 Rem. has been offered in just about every rifle action type ever conceived and a few handguns. Sadly, I can’t find a single major gunmaker chambering this cartridge today.



The .35 Rem. pushes a 200-grain bullet to just more than 2000 f.p.s. and is probably a better deer and black bear cartridge at “woods ranges” than the more popular .30-30 Win. Most ammunition makers have a 200-grain load, and Remington also has a 150-grain load with a muzzle velocity of 2300 f.p.s. Hornady’s  LEVERevolution pushes the performance up a notch with a 200-grain pointed bullet at 2225 f.p.s.



On those gray, moody November days when I am feeling blue I take my Remington Model 141 pump-action rifle in .35 Rem. into the deer woods, and I pine for what could have been.



<strong>.356 Winchester</strong>

If the .35 Rem. is on the threatened list, this one is on a path to extinction. Back in 1983 Winchester introduced the .356 Win. as a way to boost the power of the Model 94 lever-action rifle. The .356 Win. offered the performance level of the .358 Win. in a rimmed cartridge that would work in a lever-action rifle. Everybody agrees that the .358 Win. is a wonderful cartridge, but nobody buys them. It was predictable that the .356 Win. would follow that tradition.



I have a .356 Win. in the Big Bore Model 94. It is very accurate, easy to carry and fast on the target. With a 200-grain bullet at 2460 f.p.s., it is a heavy-hitter on whitetails. Every time I use it I ask myself, “What’s not to like?” Beats me, but nobody liked it enough to keep it in production. Winchester still offers ammunition, but the guns are history.



<strong>.358 Winchester</strong>

Loved by gun guys and rejected by the huddled masses, this is perhaps the most underappreciated cartridge of them all. The .358 Win. was introduced in 1955. The .358 Win. was simply a .308 Win. necked up to .35 caliber. It is capable of driving a

200-grain bullet to almost 2500 f.p.s. and is a good cartridge for hunting the thick woods for deer, hogs, black bear or even elk.



It was introduced in the bolt-action Model 70 in which it was trustworthy, but boring. But when Winchester chambered the .358 the following year in its unique lever-action, the Model 88, it became a really interesting cartridge.



For a while Savage chambered it in the Model 99, and I am still looking for one I can afford. Right now, I think that the Browning BLR lever-action rifle is the only production gun left on the market in .358 Win.



Winchester and Hornady both offer 200-grain loads at 2475 f.p.s. From the “Green Goblin” (a bolt-action rifle I built on a Remington action), both will produce groups that are sub-minute-of-angle.



<strong>.350 Remington Magnum</strong>

A failed product is often said to be “ahead of its time,” which is usually just a polite way of saying nobody wanted to buy it. The Remington Model 600 Magnum rifle, along with the cartridge it birthed, was just such a product. As many hunters know, the Remington Model 600 carbine, which was introduced in 1964, was one of the first short, light, bolt-action rifles to find success with deer hunters. When chambered for cartridges such as the .243 Win., 6 mm Rem., .308 Win. and .35 Rem., it was an excellent woods rifle for hunting whitetails. In 1965 Remington took it to the next level with the introduction of the Model 600 Magnum Carbine. This new model featured two new cartridges, the .350 Rem. Mag. and the 6.5 mm Rem. Mag. They truly were ahead of their time, as they were short magnums back when being a short magnum wasn’t cool. The trouble is, they didn’t sell.



The 600 Magnum suffered from a barrel that was too short at 18½ inches. In 1968 the 600 Magnum was replaced by the Model 660 Magnum, which featured a 20-inch barrel, but it was never a big seller, and Remington dropped the rifles.



The ammunition hung on a while longer, but eventually Big Green abandoned her babies and stopped making both cartridges. But in 2003 Remington decided to attempt a resurrection. The .350 Rem. Mag. is still not burning up the sales records, so maybe ahead of its time is the wrong description. It’s a decent cartridge, but American hunters just won’t flock to it.



The Remington Model 673 Guide Rifle was chambered in .350 Rem. Mag. The barrel is a full 22 inches, like it always should have been, but the foolish design with the huge “shark fin” front sight turned hunters off, and it was dropped.



Remington currently lists a Model 7 rifle with a 20-inch barrel; today’s version of the 600 in .350 Rem. Mag., and I think that’s the only current production rifle in that cartridge. I have one, and I like it a lot. It shoots well and is light and easy to carry while hunting. I have shot a few critters, including a tough South Texas Nilgai, and have been happy with the performance. Ruger made a few bolt-actions some years back, and Remington made rifles in the 700 Classic line, but they are long gone.



Remington loads a 200-grain PSP Core-Lokt bullet at a muzzle velocity of 2775 f.p.s. Nosler offers the .350 Rem. Mag. in its NoslerCustom line with a 225-grain Partition bullet at 2550 f.p.s. And Barnes makes a 200-grain TSX bullet designed for this cartridge that, when handloaded to 2850 f.p.s., allows the .350 Rem. Mag. to achieve its potential.



<strong>.35 Whelen</strong>

The origins of the .35 Whelen are controversial even today. The long accepted story was that James V. Howe developed the cartridge in 1922 and named it in honor of his friend, gunwriter Col. Townsend Whelen. That version is in some dispute, with evidence that Whelen himself developed the cartridge or at least worked with Howe on its development. All we do know for sure is that it was either Howe or Whelen, or both, who necked the .30-’06 Sprg. up to 0.358 inches and dubbed it “the poor man’s magnum.”



In 1987 Remington made an honest cartridge out of the .35 Whelen. The company has chambered several rifles in the cartridge including models in bolt-action, pump-action and semi-automatic. Ruger briefly chambered the M77 rifle in .35 Whelen. Also H&amp;R 1871, Inc., offered single-shot rifles in .35 Whelen from 1994 to 1996. They have almost all abandoned the cartridge. The only rifles I can find in production are from Nosler, Remington and CVA.



The ammunition situation is a little better than the rifles. Remington continues to offer factory ammo, and its 200-grain factory load has a muzzle velocity of 2675 f.p.s., while the 250-grain load’s muzzle velocity is 2400 f.p.s. Federal loads the 225-grain Trophy Bonded Bear Claw bullet with a muzzle velocity of 2600 f.p.s. Fusion Ammo has a 200-grain with a muzzle velocity of 2800 f.p.s. Hornady has a Superformance load with a 200-grain SP at 2910 f.p.s. Barnes has a Vor-TX load with a 180-grain TSX bullet and a muzzle velocity of 2900 f.p.s. Nosler has three loads in its Custom line. They include both the AccuBond and the Partition 225-grain bullets with a muzzle velocity of 2800 f.p.s. and a 250-grain Partition load with a muzzle velocity of 2550 f.p.s.



If you match the bullet to the game, this is one of the all-time great hunting cartridges. I have used the .35 Whelen on critters from bobcats to moose. Included in that have been a whole bunch of deer, hogs and a bear or two. It has never failed me. I believe it never will.

I own several rifles in this cartridge and all my .35 Whelen rifles are accurate. With the best loads, my Remington Model 700 is one-hole accurate. With a 200-grain bullet the .35 Whelen actually shoots a bit flatter than the .30-’06 Sprg. with a similar 180-grain bullet. The .35 Whelen is accurate, hits hard, penetrates deep, shoots flat and recoils mildly. Why the public abandoned it so quickly is a mystery to me.



<strong>.358 Norma Magnum</strong>

The .358 Norma Mag. was designed for the American market, but sadly no American riflemaker ever chambered the cartridge in a cataloged gun. It’s often thought that if they had it would have gained popularity over the .338 Win. Mag.They have almost identical case capacity, but the .358 Norma Mag. can drive the same weight bullet a bit faster. One can almost hear the echoes of Norma Mag. crying, “My kingdom for a rifle.”



The .358 Norma Mag. factory load is a 250-grain Oryx bullet listed with a muzzle velocity of 2723 f.p.s. That load actually produced 2825 f.p.s. from my E.R. Shaw rifle’s 24-inch barrel. Norma offers factory ammunition, E.R. Shaw will make a rifle, as will any other custom, or semi-custom, riflemaker.



If we compare the .300 Win. Mag. loaded with a 180-grain Oryx bullet to the .358 Norma Mag. with a 250-grain Oryx bullet-both with a 200-yd. zero-we see that contrary to popular belief, a 35-caliber can be a long-range cartridge. At 300 yds., the .358 Norma impacts only 0.96" lower than the .300 Win. At 400 yds., the .358 Norma impacts 3.1 inches lower than the .300 Win. Mag. The .358 has 24 percent more energy at the muzzle than the .300 Win. Mag. At 300 yards, it has 19 percent more energy than the .300 Win. Mag.-all with a bigger, heavier bullet that will punch a bigger hole and penetrate deeper. I have used this cartridge on moose with excellent results. I would also expect it to handle anything in North America from deer to the big bears.



While the American mainstream won’t accept the .35, they are not unloved. Gun guys recognize the potential in the .358. Perhaps that’s how it should be, the masses rarely embrace true greatness. No matter if it’s books, art or hunting cartridges, it’s only those with a deep understanding of the subject who can fully understand the greatness often buried in obscurity.]]>

I think ignorance and Walmart availability have alot to do with alot of calibers dying off. I don't know how many times I've heard people say '...a 35 has way too much recoil' and for some reason people believe this. Also, have you been to a gun store lately? It's like if you ask for anything besides a Glock 40 or a AR 15 you're an idiot. Luckily I have a friend with a FFL that gets a kick out of things i have him order me. [(] 357 Max and 10mm Buckeye special Ruger Blackhawks, LAR Grizzly 45 Win Mag ect.[)] Another reason is everyone I talk to at the range seems to only buy calibers if walmart carries the ammo. Not a good thing to go by. Sports Athority, Sears, Kmart used to sell ammo too. My 35 will always be my favorite huntin rifle. I seem to get a buck every year when I use it so now its all I hunt with.]]></comment_content>

      <![CDATA[The Glock G17 9 mm Luger pistol is considered by some to represent a milestone for modern combat handgun design. Before the Glock arrived on the market, the idea of using impact-resistant plastic to form a pistol frame was seen as not only impractical, but laughable. It’s been more than 30 years since Austria adopted the Glock for use by its armed forces, and just a little more than 27 years since the pistol began to be imported for sale on the U.S. market. Needless to say, no one is laughing now. Just as the M1911 and CZ-75 have inspired the design features in many other pistols, plenty of gun manufacturers, both large and small, are using the Glock as the inspiration for their own polymer-frame semi-automatic handguns.



Dozens of changes to the Glock platform have been introduced through the years, even though the pistol appears to have remained essentially the same to those who are unfamiliar with it. After all, you can have any color of Glock you want, as long as it’s black. Some changes were developed as functional improvements to the gun, while others fulfilled specific military or law enforcement contract requirements (the recently released G30S in .45 ACP is a good example of a contract-to-market model).



Glock is now offering the fourth generation of its landmark pistol design, and to understand what makes Gen4 pistols different, and in some aspects just the same, as previous versions, it’s helpful to take a look at what came before. Although it’s neither possible nor practical to list all of the various modifications here, a general overview can be derived by looking at the major changes between each of the generations.



<strong>From Generation 1 to Generation 3 (1982 - 2009)</strong>

The first Glock pistols, including the Standard-size G17 9 mm (1982) and the G18 Select Fire models (1987), were duty-size pistols intended for military applications. The two most notable features, and the most controversial at the time, were the use of a polymer frame and the Safe-Action trigger ignition system, which excluded the use of grip or thumb safeties.



The pistol had a square slide treated with the Tenifer process to give it a 64 Rockwell C hardness rating and a high level of corrosion resistance. The gray Tenifer slide was then treated with a matte-black Parkerized finish to match the polymer frame. The fixed combat-style sights were made of polymer, with a white dot front sight and a white outline rear sight. The guide rod used an uncaptured spring, the frame had a 360-degree, light-texture grip surface, and the polymer 17-round detachable-box magazines were only partially lined with metal. They did not drop free from the frame when the magazine release was pressed.



By 1988, Glock was ready to introduce the second generation with the release of the first Compact-size model, the G19 9 mm, and the first long-slide version, the G17L. During the Gen2 time period, Glock would also introduce models chambered in .40 S&amp;W (G22 and G23), .45 ACP (G21) and 10 mm (G20). A .380 ACP version was also developed (G25), but it is not, as of yet, available in the United States because of BATFE importation restrictions.



There were two varieties of the Gen2 frame. The two-pin frame, utilizing a support pin for the trigger and one for the trigger assembly, was employed for the 9 mm models and the now discontinued G24 .40 S&amp;W. The three-pin frame had an additional pin installed above the trigger pin to lend added support to the locking block in the larger caliber models. Other internal changes included rear rail support tabs, which were longer than those of the Gen1 pistols (and later versions), a captured spring guide rod assembly, and improvements to key components such as the firing pin, extractor and trigger bar.



The Gen2 grip was enhanced with molded-in serrations and checkering on the front and back straps, which is now considered to be the earliest version of the Rough Texture Frame (RFT1). Magazines were upgraded to include a full-length metal lining, they dropped free from the grip, and the springs, followers and baseplates were improved.



In 1996, Glock began the introduction of what can be collectively categorized as the Gen3 feature set. This was also the year that the first Subcompact Glocks were launched with the introduction of the G26 9 mm and the G27 .40 S&amp;W. Also known as “Baby Glocks,” the smallest of the Glock pistols utilize an abbreviated double-stack magazine and a stubby dual-recoil spring assembly instead of the single captured spring assembly found in the larger models.



Gen3 features included checkered finger grooves added to the frontstrap, as well as the addition of scalloped thumb rests on both the left and right sides of the grip. A molded-in accessory rail was added to the Standard and Compact models to facilitate the use of pistol-mounted lights and laser sighting modules. The extractors were reshaped to act as visible and tactile loaded-chamber indicators.



During 2003, Glock marked another important milestone for the company with the introduction of the first pistol cartridge to bear the company’s name, the .45 GAP (Glock Automatic Pistol). The cartridge, with its accompanying pistols (G37, G38 and G39), was originally developed for American law enforcement agencies that wanted the stopping power of the .45 ACP cartridge in a pistol with the slim grip and slide profile of Glock’s 9 mm offerings. Although the .45 GAP cartridge has proven to be a reliable and accurate round, it has yet to catch on as a mainstream defensive cartridge.



Beginning in 2007, Glock introduced the Short-Frame (SF) version of the G21, called the G21SF, followed by SF versions of other large-frame pistols including the G20, G29, and G30. Originally intended to compete in certain military contract trials, the SF models have a 0.098-inch reduction in trigger reach, and full-size models feature a 0.16-inch reduction in backstrap depth. The result is a grip frame that’s a more comfortable fit for shooters with smaller hands. The year also the marked the company’s milestone of selling more than 5 million pistols worldwide.



A few of the Gen3 pistols manufactured, prior to the introduction of the Gen4 models, featured the second generation of the Rough Texture Frame (RTF2). It consisted of small raised dots covering the sides and backstrap, closely mimicking a popular aftermarket modification of applying heavy-grit grip tape to the frame to provide better traction. They also had curved, gill-like slide serrations instead of straight cuts. Neither of those features survived into the fourth generation.



<strong>Generation 4 (2010 - Present)</strong>

In 2010, the Gen4 pistols arrived on the scene with nine models sporting the freshly introduced design updates. As of this writing, all but one of the pistols sold in the United States (G36 Slim Frame) are available with the latest features. The primary internal change of this iteration was a move from a single-spring recoil assembly to a new dual-spring assembly used in not only the Subcompact models as before, but in the Compact and Standard size pistols as well.



The rest of the Gen4 changes are primarily cosmetic in nature and occur on the frame. The magazine release has been enlarged from 0.20 inches to 0.50 inches in length. The release can also be relocated to the other side of the frame for left-handed shooters. Although Gen3 magazines can be used with a factory configured Gen4 magazine release, only the Gen4 magazines have an additional indentation required to accommodate the shift of the magazine release from the left to the right side. The grip features the latest rough texture design (RTF3) that consists of small, raised, blunted pyramids that replace the serrations and checkering found on the Gen3 models.



One more key change to the frame is the addition of an interchangeable backstrap system. Two backstraps and an installation tool are provided with new Gen4 pistols. The standard frame, with no backstrap installed, provides a grip profile like that of the SF models. Installing the thinner back strap returns the grip size to that of a standard Gen3 model, while installing the thicker backstrap adds an extra 0.08 inches of grip circumference for shooters with larger hands. Regardless of how the grip is configured, the grip angle remains the same.



With more than three years on the market now, how has the Gen4 pistol faired? Some Glock customers reacted to the Gen4 configuration changes much like Coca-Cola fans did when the drink company introduced New Coke in 1985. In other words, they were not impressed because they liked the pistol just the way it was. Those who liked the Gen3 grip saw no need for the added backstraps. During the 2010 to 2011 production run, a few of the new recoil assemblies suffered from reliability issues with certain varieties of ammunition, which further fanned the flames of some shooters’ discontent. In truth, less than 2 percent of the pistols constructed during the initial run exhibited reliability issues, and Glock quickly launched a voluntary spring-swap program for anyone who felt the part needed to be replaced.



<strong>On the Range with Gen4 Glocks</strong>

So are the Gen4 updates to the Glock platform just a bit of marketing fluff, or do they really make the pistol better? As a fan and owner of Gen3 Glock models that span the size and caliber categories, I believed it was logical to test a few of the Gen4 models for myself before making up my mind. So far, I like what I’ve seen.



Although the Gen4 changes work nicely on all the Glock frame sizes, they really shine at the extremes, namely, the largest frame models (G20 and G21) and the smallest (Subcompacts). In the case of the heavy-hitting 10 mm G20 and .45 ACP G21, the dual-spring recoil assembly nicely reduces the level of felt recoil. Achieving the same amount of recoil reduction in the Gen3 pistols requires the installation of an aftermarket steel guide rod and heavy-weight recoil spring. For shooters with smaller hands (like me), the reduced grip circumference and aggressive grip texturing takes the largest of the Glock grips from feeling too large to handle comfortably, to a workable shooting grip. It’s also easier to reach and operate the enlarged magazine release.



The Subcompacts are favored for their excellent combination of low weight, ammunition capacity, and stopping power. However, when loaded with high-velocity cartridges such as the .357 SIG and 10 mm, they can be a handful to shoot. The reduced grip size and aggressive grip texturing of the Gen4 again work to make these little bucking broncos manageable in the felt recoil department.



With 18 models of Gen4 Glocks to choose from these days, it was hard to pick a single model to work with for this evaluation. However, after test firing the new-for-2013 G33 Subcompact in .357 SIG at the SHOT Show this year, I was eager to get my hands on another one for a thorough field test. The G33 is lean and compact, sharing the same barrel length, slide width, and grip profile as the G26 (9 mm) and G27 (.40 S&amp;W). As a result, a wide variety of holsters, sights, and after-market accessories are available to fit it. Weighing 19.75 ounces. unloaded, the G33 uses a nine-round flush-fit magazine. If you are looking to extend the two-finger grip, or to increase the pistol’s ammunition capacity, the G33 will accept G32 13-round or G31 15-round magazines.



At the range, the G33 proved to be both a dependable and accurate pistol to work with. This gun ran flawlessly with a mix of full-metal-jacket and hollow-point ammunition. The factory fixed sights are not the best system available, but they get the job done. The magazines proved to be reliable, and they dropped free cleanly when the enlarged magazine release was pressed. The trigger pull was slightly lighter than expected, breaking at 5 pounds, 6 ounces, instead of the advertised 5 pounds, 8 ounces. Although the stock Gen4 Glock triggers are a little heavy and a bit mushy (like their predecessors), the tactile and audible click of the short trigger reset allows the shooter to ride the trigger for quick follow-up shots.



The G33 demonstrated a level of accuracy usually reserved for larger handguns. When testing short-gripped, short-barreled carry pistols, it’s not uncommon to wheel targets into the 7-yard range to check their performance. However, the Glock Subcompacts tend to demonstrate accuracy potential in line with their Compact and Standard compatriots. So accuracy testing was conducted with targets at 25 yards to see what the pistol could really do. Working slowly from a bench rest, the selected test ammunition produced five-shot groups ranging from 2.73 inches to 3.61 inches in size, with five group averages in the 3.05 inch to 3.29-inch size range.



Shooting the pistol off of the bench in a two-handed grip confirmed that the G33 is not a gun for recoil-shy shooters. The levels of perceived recoil produced by the .357 SIG cartridge are usually comparable to or slightly greater than those of the .40 S&amp;W in pistols of similar size. Having fired Glock Subcompacts in the “Big Three” defensive calibers (9 mm, .40 S&amp;W and .45 ACP), I found this pistol and ammunition combination to be less palm-pasting than the .40 S&amp;W, but certainly more peppy than the 9 mm.



<strong>Final Thoughts</strong>

After three decades of proven reliability, durability and accuracy, you can still find shooters who have little in the way of positive commentary to share in regards to the “ugly” Glock pistol. But handsome is as handsome does. Despite all of its competitors, the Glock is still one of the most highly prized and commonly adopted defensive pistols on the market.



Some shooters may be wondering if it’s time to trade out their earlier Glocks for the new Gen4 models. Based on my experience, that won’t be necessary. If the Glock you have fits your hands and fills your defensive requirements, then there’s no need to give it up or sell it off any time soon. In fact, Glock has kept the Gen3 and SF versions in its catalog, at least for now. If, however, you’re in the market for a new pistol, a lifetime member of the South Paw Club, or find the Gen3 pistols to be a poor fit for your hand shape, then the Gen4 updates will certainly make the latest versions of the Glock an attractive defensive option.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[The sub-compacts in .45acp are a very bad idea.  The major point is that the .45acp is a slow moving round with low penetration even when fired out of a full 5 inch barrel but when you cut it way, way back to sub-compact level it becomes very anemic.  After WWII the U.S. tested the .45acp on a WWII helmet and were shocked to find out it bounced off said helmet at a scant 35 yards.   The 9mm penetrated the helmet at an astonishing 125 yards.  For sub-compacts the 9mm is the way to go.   Actually even a small skinny man can easily conceal the bigger Glock 19 which has a longer barrel and can control it better as well.   The sub-compact is basically a bad idea right from the beginning.]]></comment_content>

    <title>An Extraordinary Achievement: The First Handgun-Mounted Light?</title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=25315</link>

      <![CDATA[The first hand-held battery-operated flashlight was invented by Russian/American immigrant Conrad Hubert in 1902, and patented the next year. Soon after that, firearm-oriented inventors explored the idea of mounting the new flashlight on a gun. Immediately, there was a big problem: When the gun fired, the recoil force would destroy the delicate filament in the bulb.



In 1911, inventor George A. Seely of San Francisco completed work on a firearm-mounted light that solved the problem. He filed for a patent in October 1911, and the Patent Number 1,029,951 was granted on June 18, 1912. The “Night Sight For Firearms” was made with watch-like precision. As you would expect, one of its main features was a careful spring-and-rubber cushioning of the delicate bulb.



The drawing on the patent copy shows the device mounted on what appears to be a .22 rifle, but the only known example is attached to a Colt Police Positive .38 Spl. revolver. Obviously, the inventor wanted to show that his system would survive the recoil of the “magnum” of that time period. The light unit was fastened securely to the barrel and frame, and two small steel tubes at the rear carried insulated wires into the frame. From there, internally, the wires went to the battery in the grip-frame.



A large aluminum “over-grip” housed the Winchester-brand 3-volt battery. Incredibly, the original battery, which has not leaked, still produces 0.6 of a volt! A bar-type pressure switch at the front of the grip turns on the light. Four small screws on the light unit allow the beam to be adjusted to point-of-impact, in the same manner as a modern-day laser unit.



The Police Positive, serial number 113775, was made early in 1915. On April 9, 1915, it was one of 10 guns shipped to the Dunham, Carrigan &amp; Hayden Co. of San Francisco. I think we can assume that the inventor, Seeley, bought his test gun from that firm. The revolver is in an original black-leather-covered fitted case, with recesses for the gun, battery, spare bulb, and a small screwdriver. The condition, overall, is 98 percent-very fine.



This is probably the only surviving example of the Seely Night Sight. It is presently owned by collector/dealer Randall Bessler of Carson City, Nev. As an experiment, a modern functional custom battery was made to the original dimensions by noted Nevada gunsmith Martin Scott. Once installed, the unit worked perfectly.



Along with George A. Seely, the patent lists a one-half assignment to “J. Salsbury,” who must have assisted in either the design, or perhaps, the funding. Today, with LEDs and lasers, we see gun-mounted light as an ordinary thing. For 1912, it was an extraordinary achievement.]]>

      <![CDATA[The well-established reputation of the Winchester Rifle has induced certain parties to offer for sale other makes of guns as ‘Improved Winchester.’ We desire to caution buyers that all guns made by us are stamped on the barrel or on the lower tang … ‘Manufactured by the Winchester Repeating Arms Co.’ … All Guns bearing these stamps are guaranteed by us, if used with Ammunition of our manufacture.” So read, in part, the “Caution to Purchasers” on page 2 of the March 1891 Winchester Repeating Arms Co. catalog, right under a sectional drawing of the Model 1873’s action.



The Winchester Model of 1873 has been called “The Gun that Won the West” for generations-and with good reason. Nearly a quarter-million of the iconic lever-actions were produced between 1873 and 1919. Today, for the first time since the signing of the Versailles Treaty, the Winchester 1873 is back on the market with the venerable Winchester name “stamped” (really roll-marked) on the barrel.



<strong>A Brief History Of The Model 1873</strong>

Recently at Brian Lebel’s Old West Auction the only known photograph of “Billy the Kid” extant sold to William Koch, of Palm Beach, Fla., for $2.3 million, making it the most expensive historic photograph ever sold. Taken on the front porch of a building in Fort Sumner, New Mexico Territory during the fall of 1880, the image shows a confident William Henry McCarty, Jr., holding a Winchester Model 1873. Books on the Old West are full of photographs of cowboys and the like posing with their favorite rifles, more often than not, Model 1873s. It has been often referred to as the “Gun that Won the West,” while some historians might dispute the title, more than 720,000 Model 1873s were produced, and its presence and role in opening the American West is most assuredly not in question.

Winchester was born in Boston, Mass., and was a prosperous clothing manufacturer in New Haven, Conn., when he invested heavily in the Volcanic Repeating Arms Co. founded by Horace Smith and Daniel Wesson in 1855. By 1857, the Volcanic had failed to find its niche in the American firearm market, due largely in part to the unique self-contained Volcanic cartridge and the problems inherent with a cartridge that had exposed powder in the base of the projectile. Winchester bought out Smith’s and Wesson’s interests in the company and reorganized it as the New Haven Repeating Arms Co. Along with the company he acquired the skills and knowledge of the chief foreman, Benjamin Tyler Henry.



By 1860 Henry was able to work out some of the bugs in the Volcanic design, and using the newly introduced .44 rimfire self-contained copper cartridge, introduced the famous lever-action that bears his name, the Henry Rifle. More than 14,000 were produced during the Civil War. The year 1866 brought about a new model with a side loading gate (King’s Improvement) and a wooden fore-end, as well as a new name, Winchester. Still available only in .44 rimfire, about 170,000 were produced between 1866 and 1898. The Model 1866 also had an added feature, a two pronged firing pin that struck the rimfire cartridge in two spots, ensuring positive ignition.



With the popularity, increased performance and reliability of center-fire cartridges, Winchester introduced the Model 1873 in .44-40 Win. (also known as .44 Winchester Center Fire or .44 WCF) to a very receptive marketplace. Also chambered in .32-20 Win. and .38-40 Win., this model outlasted and outsold all other Winchester lever-actions until the introduction of the John Moses Browning-designed Model 1894. With the capability of having one cartridge for both rifle and revolver, the Model 1873 chambered in .44-40 Win. was a frontier favorite.



Available in a dizzying array of variations, today’s collector can easily spend the rest of his or her life-and a considerable fortune-collecting the various types and variations of the Model 1873. Rifles, carbines, muskets, deluxe and even one of 100 (eight made) and one of 1,000 (136 made) special-order deluxe engraved guns, offer the collector a wide variety to seek for their collections.



<strong>Shooting the “New” Model 1873</strong>

Available in two variations from the Winchester Repeating Arms Co.-the Model 1873 Short Rifle and Model 1873 Sporter Case Hardened-this “new” lever-action is a worthy successor to its legendary predecessor. Both models have 20-inch round barrels and are only chambered in .357 Mag., which allows the shooting of .38 Spl.-the latter is a favorite of cowboy action shooting competitors. The Short Rifle, reviewed here, has a blued frame and barrel, while the Sporter Case Hardened’s receiver is color-casehardened with a blued barrel.



The new Model 1873 as manufactured by Japan’s Miroku-the maker of numerous Browning and Winchester lever-actions and single-shots, as well as Browning’s Citori-is a faithful continuation and modern recreation of the famed model that ceased production back in 1919. The Short Rifle has a nicely figured walnut, straight-grip, oil-stained, satin finish stock and a blued steel crescent buttplate. Sights are a Marble Arms gold bead front and a semi-buckhorn rear, just like the originals. The quality of the bluing-and more importantly the polish underneath it-was excellent; there were no blemishes, and it was rich and even.



On the receiver’s right, a blued steel loading gate allows loading 10 rounds of .357 Mag. or 11 rounds of .38 Spl. into the under-barrel tubular magazine. At present, that is the only chambering. The tang is pre-drilled and tapped for an optional aperture rear sight. You will not find one of those obnoxious thumb safeties on this model; it has the original Winchester lever disconnect safety as well as a new firing pin block with a striker that prevents the firing pin from moving forward unless the trigger is pulled. The new ’73 maintains the classic lines and features of the original.



Out of the box, the sample rifle has one of the smoothest actions I have ever encountered on a lever gun. No need for you to make a special trip to the local gunsmith to fine tune this rifle, as it was smooth as silk. At the range, I found it just about perfect for the novice or seasoned cowboy action shooter who wants to shoot a gun bearing the Winchester name without fretting over damaging or devaluing a century-old antique.



Most who have shot a Winchester 1895 in .405 Win. or any rifle with a crescent buttplate and a high-power cartridge, find the shotgun buttplate (a flat or slightly curved butt) to be far less punishing than a crescent shaped buttplate. Nonetheless, with the Model 1873, then as now, it was only chambered in handgun cartridges that never came close to packing the punch of the later Model 1876s, 1886s and 1895s. For this reason the 1873’s crescent buttplate is comfortable to shoot and doesn’t leave the shooter with a painful memory of an otherwise enjoyable day at the range. Another advantage of the crescent shaped buttplate is, when rapid firing offhand, the crescent shape helps hold the rifle firmly in place on your shoulder.



Shooting the rifle was enjoyable, and its operation was flawless. Technically, it is a rifle but with a carbine length barrel, and as such it shouldered well and pointed on target effortlessly. Finding the front sight was no problem with the Marble gold bead, and the semi-buckhorn rear sight is not only historically correct but practical and effective.

Three types of ammunition were used at 50 yards to evaluate the rifle and all performed within the acceptable variance of accuracy given the use of the supplied iron sights and the author’s aging eyes. Younger eyes or a rear aperture sight may have tightened the groups, but most cowboy action shooters and plinkers will find the accuracy acceptable. Even when firing the rifle with .357 Mag. rounds, there was no unpleasant recoil impulse due to the crescent shape of the buttplate. It was actually hard to discern the difference in recoil between the .38 Spl. and the .357 Mag. as both rounds exerted negligible recoil when fired from a rifle that weighs 7 pounds, 4 ounces.



Unlike shooting an original Model 1873, the ejecting shells fall free of the shooter with each and every shot. That’s thanks to some engineering changes to the carrier block, which kicks empties away from the shooter on ejection. After running several hundred rounds through the gun for this review, not one of the spent casings fell anywhere close to my head or face-a surprise for a longtime shooter of original 1873s.



With its chambering in .357 Mag., hopefully this latest Model 1873 will once again find a niche with hunters as well as cowboy action shooters who desire a smooth functioning lever-action bearing the Winchester name.

        <![CDATA[Interesting article, however I will stick with my original '73',, shoots fine,, accurate,, and its a 'rifle' for those long shots. 
I got it from an old 'Idaho Pioneer' and inquired as to why he had removed the 'tube spring'? 
He replied, 'when i used this rifle, i wanted plenty of bullets'!! , and this added a few, and when I 'lever' it, i just tip the barrel up a tad and they 'gravity flow'.. ,, works fine..

I must add,, 'works for me also'!!

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I agree, it is very disappointing to hear that this rifle is not being built in the USA. I think I will hold off even tho I was really excited about buying it. Winchester needs to reconsider this. I really think they are hurting their sales. ]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[Dennis
Superior to anything made in New Haven from 1964 to 2006 and arguably better than the pre 64s. 
Cost, like a fine whisky, it’s worth every penny.
The 357/38 chambering allows for a greater range of power than the 44-40.

      <![CDATA[The U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program didn’t exactly come to fruition within the military, but it did cause a number of manufacturers to produce new service-type handguns that consumers now get to enjoy. One of those is the <a href="http://www.fnhusa.com/l/products/handguns/fnx-series/fnx-45/" target="_blank">FNX-45 from FNH USA</a>, a polymer-frame, hammer-fired, double-action/single-action pistol based on the model FNH developed for the program.



The FNX-45 is a big pistol, measuring about 7 1/2 inches long and weighing 33 ounces unloaded. FNH focused on battlefield duty and not concealed carry when developing it. The size of the FNX-45 may rule out concealing it under clothing in most situations, but the pistol has plenty going for it as an open-carry or home-defense gun-not the least of which is a healthy magazine capacity of 15 rounds of .45 ACP.



Learn more about the FNX-45 with the video below, hosted by <a href="http://www.shootingillustrated.com/" target="_blank"><em>Shooting Illustrated's</em> </a>Adam Heggenstaller.



<strong>Technical Specifications:</strong>

<strong>Caliber:</strong> .45 ACP

<strong>Operation:</strong> DA/SA

<strong>Sights:</strong> Fixed 3-Dot

<strong>Capacity:</strong> 15 rounds

<strong>Weight:</strong> 33.2 oz. empty

<strong>Width:</strong> 1.58″

<strong>Height:</strong> 6.3″

<strong>Barrel Length:</strong> 4.5″

<strong>Overall Length:</strong> 7.4″

<strong>Twist Rate:</strong> 1:16"

        <![CDATA[bought one of these when they first hit the stores about a year ago.[(] The fnx45 tactial[)]

I took it to the range and at 25 yards I could put a tennis ball in the hole in the center of the target. ' with standard ball ammo' I haven't shot a 45acp pistol this accurate since the NRA match 1911s I shot in USMC . I love this pistol.

Only down side is you can't find a holster or mags for it.<!--mobile-->]]>

Mine came in a great package that included a Kydex holster,  2 mags and butt plates, and adjustable strap for handle and a dummy yellow barrel insert for practice.  Love it!

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I have the tac model.  I'm a pretty big guy [(]6'1''[)] and 280 and I can wear it under a NRA carry vest or a coat and its not noticible.  It also fits nicely with the light in my Maxpedition carry bag.  Its an improved verision of the FNP and the differences are rather minor IMHO.  As to the mag capacity.. I agree with Mr. Jeff Cooper on just about anything, but I also believe that nobody ever said, 'gee I wish I had brought less ammo' in a gunfight.  I had to choose between this and the HK 45 and went with the tactical model..  It is impossible to go wrong with this gun!]]></comment_content>

    <title>Ruger Introduces SR-762 Piston-Driven Rifle</title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=25538</link>

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.ruger.com/index.html" target="_blank">Sturm, Ruger &amp; Company, Inc.</a> has announced the release of its new SR-762, which brings the .308 Win./7.62 NATO cartridge to the popular SR-556 family of rifles.



The SR-762 retains the features that have made the <a href="http://www.ruger.com/products/sr556/index.html?r=y" target="_blank">SR-556</a> line successful among AR-style rifles. The patent-pending, two-stage piston delivers a smooth power stroke tot he one-piece bolt carrier, reducing felt recoil and improving the rifle's durability. A four-position gas regulator allows the shooter to tune the rifle to function reliably with an array of ammunition and in varying conditions.



Ideal for shooters that appreciate the familiar AR platform, the SR-762 offers the downrange authority of the .308 cartridge in a two-stage, piston-drive rifle that runs cooler and cleaner than traditional, gas-driven AR-style rifles.



A heavy contour, 16.12” chrome-lined, cold hammer forged barrel with a 1:10” twist features exterior fluting to minimize weight. With the Ruger Lightweight Adaptable handguard in place, the SR-762 weighs in at 8.6 pounds.



The rifle ships with folding backup iron sights, a Hogue Monogrip, Picatinny rail sections, a six-position stock, a sight adjustment tool and a soft-sided case. Three 20-round <a href="http://store.magpul.com/" target="_blank">Magpul</a> P-Mag magazines are also included.

      <![CDATA[Jessica Grayson was driving behind a pickup truck when the truck suddenly stopped in front of her, blocking her lane. A man exited the truck and approached Grayson's vehicle. He began beating on the window and grabbing the door handle in an attempt to get in. Jessica quickly pulled out her Colt .357 revolver. "…I pointed my gun at him and told him to step away from my car or I would shoot him," Grayson explained. The assailant immediately backed away from her vehicle and left. "You hear a lot of stories about guns being used in crime, but they prevent crime every day, too," Grayson said. "What if I hadn't had my gun that day?" (<em><a href="http://www.advertisergleam.com/" target="_blank">The Advertiser-Gleam</a></em>, Danville, AL, 6/28/13)



A man attempted to rob a Dollar General store in Evansville, Ind., with what appeared to be a plastic-wrapped gun. Pastor Carl Sanders was approached by the robber and told to get on the ground, but Sanders pulled his own pistol and said, "No, you get on the ground." Police arrived and arrested the robber, and the pastor plans to visit him to help him get his life on track.

<strong>From The Armed Citizen Archives</strong>

<em>August 1976:</em> When a man armed with a sawed-off shotgun walked into a St. Louis, Mo., carry-out restaurant and announced a holdup, manager Robert Purvis, working in the rear of the store, grabbed a revolver. Both men fired simultaneously. The robber was mortally wounded. Purvis received a hand wound.

      <![CDATA[Handguns are intensely personal tools and some shooters cannot resist the temptation to further personalize their hardware. Sam Colt knew this as well as anyone in the gun business, and he hired some of the world’s greatest artisans to engrave revolvers for customers.



All of the major handgun makers continue to maintain a staff of skilled craftsmen to ornament their products. It’s getting harder to do, since many of today’s pistols come with polymer receivers, which doesn’t respond well to engraving. However, the barrel and slide is steel and can be engraved. This note is about a particular item of hardware that is a polymer gun that is also engraved. And you can own it.



The gun is a <a href="http://ruger.com/index.html" target="_blank">Ruger</a> LC9 made in Ruger’s custom shop. While the bottom is a stock gun, the top is beautifully scroll engraved and coated with a special bronze coating. A handsome little piece if there ever was one, this little 9 mm auto is the only one like it in the world. This custom gun will be auctioned off by <a title="Go to GunBroker.com for more information and to bid. " href="http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=371520605" target="_blank">GunBroker.com</a>, with the money derived from the auction going to the U.S. Shooting Team. So if your bid is the winning one, it will directly impact American shooters in International shooting.

      <![CDATA[In pretty much all self-defense situations, distance is your friend. Putting distance between you and an attacker increases your chances of getting away unscathed, without having to use force to defend yourself.



If, however, you do have to draw and fire, you don’t want to stand like you’re on the firing line of the local range. Instead, you should move away from the danger to potential cover. As such, you need know how to fire on the move, possibly at a moving target.



While running all out and blasting away looks really cool in the movies, it’s actually an excellent way to waste ammunition and possibly hit something, or someone, for which you’re not aiming (remember you’re not using blanks). You are responsible for every single bullet that comes out of your gun, so unless you have a good sight picture of your target, even when moving, you shouldn’t press the trigger. Also, if you’re running full speed, you should probably keep running on out of the danger zone, so you won’t have to shoot anyway.



Moving forward or backward in a fight is fairly simple. Move forward by stepping out with the lead foot, landing on the heel and rolling to the toe. The same motion in reverse is used to move backward, toe to heel. Lateral motion is obtained by what is called “Big Step, Little Step.” Take a long step with the lead foot in the direction that you want to go and follow it with a shorter step from the opposite foot in a shuffling motion, making sure you don’t cross your feet. All movement, regardless of direction, should be conducted with the upper body slightly forward and the knees slightly bent.



Once the motions are understood, practice is needed for proper use. Unfortunately, many ranges are not set up to allow movement when shooting. One way to obtain movement training is through competitions such as USPSA and IDPA. Another is with an unloaded handgun in the comfort of, well, anywhere that won’t result in someone dialing the number of a Porsche model.



In a fairly open area, set up a target at about eye level. Then, check to ensure your gun in unloaded and that there is no ammunition is in the room. Double check the gun. While any handgun can be used, or even no gun if you only want to practice the motions, a semi-auto with second-strike capability or a revolver is best to allow multiple trigger pulls, paired with a hammer-activated laser, such as the <a href="http://www.laserlyte.com/" target="_blank">LaserLyte</a> LT-PRO, to mark hits.



Once everything is safe and set up, start slow from multiple locations with the gun in a holster and concealed by a cover garment. You can use furnishings as cover or concealment, and as barriers to force changes in direction. As you get more comfortable, speed up, add more targets and additional trigger pulls.



Once you feel you’ve mastered the craft, have a partner place the targets without your knowledge or try it in the dark with a light. There is almost no scenario that can’t be set with the right imagination and space.]]>

      <![CDATA[Alaskan and former U.S. Marine Odean Hall is an avid outdoorsman who understands the demands placed on outdoor knives, yet believes that working knives can still be works of art. Each of Hall’s handmade custom designs-such as the one shown here, which features a blade made from a farrier’s rasp-is unique and limited only to the customer’s imagination.



They range from hunting and skinning models to fighters. He works with 1095, 01 tool steel, and 52100 for high-carbon blades and with ATS 34 and 440C for stainless applications and makes guards and buttcaps from stainless, brass, bronze and nickel silver. Finishes include mirror-polished, brushed, bead-blasted and Cerikote.



Hall also heat treats and tempers all his blades on site. Both leather and Kydex sheaths are available, with the former hand-tooled by Hall’s wife, Suzanne. Hall offers a lifetime warranty along with discounts to active-duty and prior-service military members. Price: Varies with materials and design.

    <title>It&#039;s Back! Ruger Releases New Red Label </title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=25663</link>

      <![CDATA[In 2011, <a href="http://ruger.com/index.html" target="_blank">Ruger</a> halted production of the highly popular Red Label shotgun. Recently, the company announced a redesigned Red Label featuring refined inner workings, a new center of gravity and reduced recoil.



“After 32 years of production, we put the Red Label on hiatus in 2011,” said Ruger President and CEO Mike Fifer. “We knew we could employ newer technology, improve the design and deliver a better performing Red Label. We have done that and restored the Red Label as the best American-made, over-and-under shotgun on the market.”



The new 12-gauge Red Label has a redistributed center of gravity for improved instinctual swing and pointing. It also features 2-inch extended forcing cones, maximum back-bored barrels and a soft Pachmayr buttpad to reduce recoil.



The Red Label comes with an American Walnut stock with a 1.5-inch drop at comb and a 2.5-inch drop at heel. Red Label shotguns are available with 26-, 28- or 30-inch barrels and each model features a 14.5-inch length of pull. The new models retain the Red Label’s classic lines and good looks, enhanced by its new stainless steel top lever. The suggested retail price for all three models is $1,399.



Each shotgun includes a custom-molded, semi-soft case, five Briley chokes (two skeet chokes and one full, one modified and one improved cylinder choke), a premium-quality Briley choke tube wrench and a safety lock.]]>

Interesting that Bill Ruger first came out with  a 20 but the new boys came back first with the 12. Sales?



Best one was the 28. We all hope Ruger brings it back, or better, the 20 on the 28 gauge frame!<!--mobile-->]]>

    <title>Knock-Off Body Armor</title>

      <![CDATA[Body armor saves lives. What goes into the gear is amazing and I, for one, am glad those who protect and serve or stand on the front line of freedom get a second chance if the unthinkable happens. Unfortunately, authorities in Florida have <a href="http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Bogus-Body-Armor-Sold-At-Florida-Gun-Shows-228654801.html" target="_blank">charged three men</a> with selling counterfeits that offer no ballistic protection. Buyers <a href="http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-10-21/news/os-body-armor-alpha-sports-20131021_1_american-body-armor-point-blank-vests" target="_blank">paid $600 to $900</a> for the “body armor” at Florida gun shows. One of the accused is a former <a href="http://www.wftv.com/news/news/local/investigators-said-ocoee-business-made-sold-counte/nbTG2/" target="_blank">Ocoee City Commissioner</a>.



Contact the manufacturer to determine authenticity if you purchased Point Blank, PACA, ABA, Gall’s, First Choice and OM Tactical body armor at gun shows in the state. There were other “manufacturers” listed, although some of them apparently do not exist.



Safariland, which owns the ABA and Second Chance lines of body armor, has <a href="http://www.safariland.com/NewsPressDetail.aspx?Id=306" target="_blank">issued a statement</a> for concerned owners. I’ve had the honor of visiting the Safariland plant, and the dedication of the entire staff to saving lives is evident the moment you walk in the front door. The company keeps a scoreboard, of sorts, with the number of officers who have been saved by its duty gear and equipment in the lobby. It’s a source of pride that runs all the way back to the ballistics lab, where the company develops and refines all of its body armor long before it hits the streets.



Photos of the officers saved cover the walls in the testing facility-a gentle reminder that what they do makes a difference, and a rightful source of pride. There they use high-speed photography to record multiple projectile impacts, have a machine to stab it dozens of times and even chronograph bullet velocities to ensure they’re emulating the proper testing conditions. The attention to detail and video produced is amazing.



Safariland and the other companies work hard to provide another level of protection to those who stand in harm’s way. That makes the alleged abuse of their logos and labels even more dangerous.



There are some who may be asking why a civilian would purchase body armor. A deployed family member is one example. Even then, deciding which product is right can be fraught with peril, as evidenced by this <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18790506/" target="_blank">ABC report</a>.



A homeowner might also consider body armor (check state and local regulations, it may not be legal in your area). Personally, I doubt I’d be composed enough during a home invasion to even remember it. But, if your safe-room door can stand up to five assailants trying to break it down, you will probably have time to slip an extra layer of defense over your jammies. Why not climb into a little more protection while you’re waiting for the cavalry to arrive?



Purchasing legitimate law enforcement or military versions could be a challenge. But, consider <a href="http://www.uspalm.com/products/armor.html" target="_blank">U.S. Primary Armament Logistical Manufacturing</a> if you want to add another layer to your home-defense strategy. The <a href="http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/28151/body-armor/" target="_blank">reviews</a> are pretty good, it sells to civilians and unlike a lot of things in life, it’s the real deal.]]>

      <![CDATA[Because of the lack of ammunition supplies over the past year or so, I always make slip past the ammo shelf whenever I’m in a big-box store, in addition to making special trips to sporting goods stores, to see if supplies have increased. Sure, I’m trying to restock my stores, but I’m also just trying to see if the panic buying is starting to subside.



Last weekend, while shopping for some household items, I made my usual side trip to the locked Plexiglas case that in recent months has caused indigestion due to the open space that should be holding well-designed boxes symbolizing one of the freedoms of this county. I wasn’t expecting much, but to my surprise there was ammunition present.  The majority of the fully loaded cartridges were of the hunting variety, with highly colored images of ducks, doves and deer, but I also saw some plain, brown-boxed <a href="http://federalpremium.com/" target="_blank">Federal</a> .223 Rem.



There were also some .45 Colt, .38 Spl. and .380 ACP rounds present, though sadly the main calibers I use-.45 ACP and 9 mm-were still missing. Also absent were the ever hard to find .22 rounds. Seeing this, however, has made me wonder if the scare is on the downward slide, and that ammunition will be available soon. I certainly hope so, but will remain skeptical until I see the removal of that three box limit sign. Are you noticing more ammunition on the shelves, or did I just get lucky?]]>

Although what has been returning to the shelves have been shotgun and some centerfire rifle cartriges, most pistol calibers and .22 long rimfire are not to be found, also notably missing are the 'Cheaper steel case' ammo, so i'm guessing the imported russian and european made ammo isn't getting to the shelves either! double hurt!  ]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[There are lines at Wal-Mart, starting around 6:00, every morning, to snap up whatever hits the shelves.  9mm seems to be fairly available, though limits still apply.



.22 caliber shipments are still minute, and disappear as soon as they hit the shelves.



Yeah, in Denver, it's near as satisfying to OBTAIN ammo as it is to actually FIRE it!!]]>

      <![CDATA[Made from high-visibility, self-healing Duraseal material in “radiation” green color, Champion’s new U.S.-made Crazy Bounce Star Target handles impacts from .17- to .50-cal. handguns and rifles without becoming misshapen, and will tumble wildly with each strike.



Exclusions to the aforementioned calibers are pellets and BBs from airguns and subsonic ammunition. The 6-inch, 9.3-ounce target also has a hole that enables it to be suspended. Price: $20.

    <title>Mossberg 500 Chainsaw ZMB Edition</title>

      <![CDATA[Love them or hate them, there’s no denying that in recent years “Zombie” products have made their mark within the shooting industry. We haven’t addressed any zombie-centric products yet on the Gun of the Week series, but we figured that now-with Halloween just a few days away-is as good a time as any. Enter the ZMB edition of the <a href="http://www.mossberg.com/" target="_blank">Mossberg</a> 500 Chainsaw.



Mossberg debuted the design at SHOT Show just a few years ago, and who could blame them for climbing on to the Zombie bandwagon? By all accounts, it’s a natural progression. Built on the iconic Mossberg 500 action-a traditional choice for a “go to” home-defense shotgun-the Chainsaw is a pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with no stock. The wrap-around chainsaw-style handgrip was added to the forend to make it easier to control. The gun is meant to be fired from the hip, and the top handle allows the operator to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip.



Learn more about the 500 Chainsaw with the video below, hosted by <a href="http://www.shootingillustrated.com/" target="_blank"><em>Shooting Illustrated's</em></a> Ed Friedman.



<strong>Technical Specifications:</strong>

<strong>Gauge:</strong> 12

<strong>Chamber Size:</strong> 3"

<strong>Capacity:</strong> 6

<strong>Barrel:</strong> 18.5" Stand-Off

<strong>Weight:</strong> 6 lbs.

<strong>Overall Length:</strong> 31"

<strong>Sights:</strong> White Dot

<strong>Chokes:</strong> Cylinder Bore

<strong>MSRP:</strong> 631

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I must not have enough sense of humor. I don't mind zombie themed toys but actual firearms... I think it's a bad idea. For starters think of defending yourself in a legitimate home defense case. Lawyers go after things like scary sounding ammo already. Imagine how they will paint you if you use that gun against an actual bad guy. I avoid anything with zombie marketing. Get a machete. They are the best anti-zombie weapons money can buy. Not speaking from experience mind you...]]></comment_content>

      <![CDATA[The U.S. Army’s adoption in 1936 of the “U.S. Semiautomatic Rifle, Caliber .30, M1,” or the M1 Garand, was an epochal event in the development of military small arms. The M1 was the first standardized semi-automatic service rifle, and proved its worth in World War II and Korea as the premier battle rifle of its era. Nonetheless, despite the well-deserved laurels eventually won by the M1, the development and adoption of the Garand rifle was rife with controversy and turmoil. There were a number of vociferous critics at the time who believed the Garand was an unsuitable rifle and its adoption would be a monumental mistake. Some of the M1s opponents were motivated by sincere concerns about the viability of the arm, while others had financial interests in competing semi-automatic designs. Among the most notable of the latter group were John D. Pedersen and Melvin M. Johnson, Jr., who each developed semi-automatic rifles of their own design that were, in their opinion, superior to the Garand. These detractors were eventually proven wrong, but for a precarious period of several years, there were serious questions as to whether the M1 would actually become our primary military service rifle.



Soon after its adoption, the widespread concerns about the M1 rifle resulted in the Ordnance Dept. contacting Winchester Repeating Arms Co. to perform an extensive evaluation of the M1. During the course of its “consultation” on the M1 rifle, the Winchester management and engineering team became convinced that the rifle was, indeed, seriously flawed. The company prepared a scathing critique and enumerated its numerous faults, real and perceived. The following is a portion of Winchester’s evaluation of the M1 Garand rifle:



“… The [Garand rifle] has been designed by parties apparently entirely unfamiliar with manufacturing and, as a consequence, the parts are intricate and very expensive to make. It is our belief that this gun will cost to manufacture approximately three times as much as it costs to make the Springfield bolt action ’03. This failure from a design end puts a very heavy mechanical burden on Springfield Armory to manufacture the gun and get it so that it will work. It puts a heavier burden on commercial companies which may be asked to produce the gun to be interchangeable with Springfield. We do not believe that it is a practical gun for quantity production in time of emergency … .”



“We would seriously recommend that the Ordnance Department review this gun carefully before proceeding to sink more money into it as it is our unqualified belief that the model will have to be changed before a satisfactory gun can be arrived at.”



Clearly, there were real concerns as whether or not the Garand was, in fact, a suitable rifle. There is no indication that the Winchester management team was giving anything but its honest assessment of the Garand in the report. However, like any successful enterprise, Winchester was always looking for new business opportunities. Its leaders felt the pervasive concerns about the Garand rifle might result in the government seeking an alternative, and the company believed it would be prudent to come up with a proprietary semi-automatic service rifle of its own. An example of Winchester missing out on a potentially lucrative government contract for arms during World War I was related in a memorandum from Edwin Pugsley, the long-serving general superintendent of Winchester:



“About 1908 or ’09, the … Winchester Company made a decision which had rather far reaching results. The decision was made to make a semi-automatic shotgun instead of a bolt-action rifle. This resulted in the development of a very troublesome shotgun mechanism and left the company without a bolt-action rifle that could be adapted for military purposes when the First World War came along. Being caught, therefore, without the basis of a military rifle, we were forced to make the British Enfield … .



“Shortly after Western [Cartridge Company] acquired the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, [I felt] there was grave danger of our being caught again without a military model in case of war, [and I] began agitating that the company take some interest in a semi-automatic military arm. Investigation was first made as to the possibilities of acquiring the commercial rights to the Garand rifle and later the Pedersen gun was rather thoroughly investigated.”



For a variety of reasons, Winchester did not acquire production rights to the Garand or Pedersen rifles. However, the firm was interested in a semi-automatic .30-caliber rifle being developed by Jonathan E. Browning, half-brother of the famed John Moses Browning. The company soon obtained the rights to the design, and Winchester engineers-assisted by Jonathan Browning-continued refining the rifle. Unfortunately, the 80-year-old Mr. Browning died on May 16, 1939, while working on the gun at the New Haven plant.



Even as Winchester was developing the Browning-designed semi-automatic rifle, the War Dept. made plans to issue an “Educational Order” to a commercial arms manufacturing firm to produce 500 M1 rifles. If successful, it was envisioned that orders for more rifles would be forthcoming. Even with its prior negative critique of the M1, Winchester was one of the firms approached about bidding on the Educational Order contract. Despite its misgivings regarding the M1 rifle, Winchester was interested in pursuing a production contract for it. However, the company still harbored hopes that the Ordnance Dept. would “come to its senses” and ditch the Garand in favor of the firm’s propriety semi-automatic rifle. This was discussed in a Sept. 28, 1938, letter from Pugsley to John Olin, head of the Western Cartridge Co. (the parent company of Winchester):



“They [the Ordnance Department] are working on an Educational Order [for the M1 rifle] which they wish to give either to Savage, Remington or Winchester, which will be on a competitive bid basis … I believe we should realize that if the [Garand] gun is continued, the successful bidder will be kept producing these guns continually from now on even if no war should come about. It seems to me best, therefore, to spar for all the time we can until we get this sample Browning gun going and see how it works. Should it prove of interest to them, it might be that we could get an Educational Order to tool up for the Browning. I am taking the position that the Ordnance Department is extremely foolish to put all its eggs in the Garand basket on such a complicated change-over from bolt-action operated to semi-automatic and that the probabilities are they would be much safer to test out a number of guns quite thoroughly before embarking on [such] an enormous program.”



Olin’s response to Pugsley’s missive contained the following passage which clearly revealed the firm’s lack of faith in the Garand rifle: “I think the plan which you have outlined in your letter is a good one to follow … as I do not feel that this rifle [the Garand] is a competent device for the Government to pin its faith to for military purposes.”



Despite these obvious misgivings, Winchester was eventually granted the Educational Order from the War Dept. to manufacture Garands, which was followed by numerous other contracts for rifles to augment Springfield Armory’s production. It seems a bit unusual that Winchester was busily engaged in manufacturing the Garand under government contract while simultaneously developing a competing design. But Ordnance was well aware of Winchester’s efforts in this regard, and some military officers even gave tacit, albeit unofficial, encouragement to the company to continue work on the design.



While the Browning semi-automatic rifle was still being worked on in an attempt to improve its functioning, Winchester engaged the services of David Marshall Williams, a former bootlegger and convict who had an innate talent for designing firearm mechanisms. Among other inventions, Williams had designed a novel short-stroke gas piston mechanism that had a number of advantages over many other gas-operated firearms. The Winchester engineering team thought that the short-stroke piston design could be teamed with the Browning rifle. As related by Pugsley: “We started immediately to replace the crude models made by Browning with a properly made arm, but were unable to make the model work satisfactorily with the ‘doughnut’ style piston sliding on the barrel. [This was] later replaced with the short stroke piston developed by (D.M.) Williams. The piston immediately put new life into the mechanism … .”



The semi-automatic rifle was designated by Winchester as the Model 30 or G30 and later variants were the G30M and G30R.



In September 1940, the Ordnance Dept. tested the improved Winchester semi-automatic rifle at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The following month, the U.S. Marine Corps announced plans to extensively test three semi-automatic rifles at its base in San Diego. These rifles were the M1 Garand, the Johnson rifle and the Winchester G30M. The bolt-action M1903 was the “control” rifle for the tests. This gave Winchester some hope that its proprietary rifle might catch the Marine Corps’ fancy instead of one of the other two semi-automatics rifles. Preliminary tests results revealed that the Garand fared better than the Johnson and Winchester designs. The summation of the report stated:



“The Winchester Rifle was seriously handicapped by the short period of time it has been under development. As demonstrated by the tests, in its present state of development it is not a satisfactory service rifle.… [T]he comparative standings of the four types of rifles competing in these tests are as follows: Springfield, Garand, Johnson and Winchester. It will be noted that this standing is in accordance with the length of time each rifle has been under development. Each of the three types of semi-automatic rifles has certain desirable characteristics. Modifications which will improve their reliability under all conditions are being made now and undoubtedly will continue to be made in the future. At the present time, however, the Marine Corps feels that its test conclusively proved that the M-1 rifle is the most satisfactory semi-automatic rifle available to the services at this time.”



Despite the Winchester G30M’s lackluster performance in the Marine Corps tests, the U.S. Army Ordnance Dept. still expressed interest in the rifle and Winchester continued refinement of the design. As stated by Pugsley: “On returning from San Diego, I told Williams to see whether he could produce a gun for the standard cartridge, .30 M2, which would have a minimum of the faults we had seen in the test gun at San Diego, and be as light as possible … .”



Several newspaper articles at the time made some mention of the Army’s interest in the Winchester semi-automatic rifle. One example was found in the March 2, 1941, edition of the Washington, D.C., Sunday Star which had a lengthy article titled “Battle of the Garand – Military Adopts Rifle, but Controversy Rages in Street.” The article focused on the trials and tribulations of the Garand rifle at that time and commented that “… A Winchester model, recently submitted, was so esteemed that the Ordnance Division encouraged its further development.”



At the time that David M. Williams was working on further improvements in the .30-caliber semi-automatic rifle, the Ordnance Dept. issued a requirement for a “light rifle” as a possible replacement for the M1911A1 .45 pistol and solicited proposals from various inventors and firearm manufacturers. Winchester submitted a design for consideration that, in some ways, resembled a miniature version of the larger G30M .30-’06 Sprg. semi-automatic rifle. This gun was eventually adopted as the “U.S. Carbine, Cal. .30, M1” and validated the concept of the short-stroke gas piston mechanism.



Winchester continued attempts to improve its “in house” semi-automatic rifle, and the refined design was renamed the G30R. It had a number of interesting characteristics, and the basic mechanism was essentially a scaled-up version of the M1 carbine action with a similar pattern operating rod, bolt and short-stroke gas piston. The upper barrel band and two-piece handguard assembly were reminiscent of, and may have been adapted from, the Model 1917 rifle. Detachable-box magazines were fabricated in five-, 10-, 20- and 30-round capacities. The Army designated the G30R as the T10E1, and it was tested at Aberdeen. The tests revealed that the functioning of the rifle was still not satisfactory, but the Ordnance Dept. was interested in further development, specifically a version modified for selective-fire operation.



It was recognized by Winchester’s management that the semi-automatic G30R was not going to replace the M1 Garand as a service rifle. Nonetheless, the company believed that a modified selective-fire version could perhaps supplant the aging Browning Automatic Rifle. Winchester submitted a substantially modified G30R with selective-fire capability and a heavier barrel fitted with a bipod. It was several pounds lighter than the rather hefty BAR, and the company designated it the “WAR” (Winchester Automatic Rifle), which was a great acronym for a military arm!



The new model was tested by the Ordnance Dept. in late December 1944, and the results were sufficiently impressive to grant a contract to Winchester for the production of 10 more of the guns. They were tested by the U.S. Army Infantry Board at Aberdeen and by the U.S. Marine Corps Equipment Board in June and July 1945. Before the test results could be compiled and evaluated, World War II ended, which obviously took a lot of urgency out of searching for a replacement for the BAR. The WAR project was dropped and, for all intents and purposes, Winchester’s proprietary .30-caliber military rifle program died with the end of the war. As stated by arms authority Konrad Schreier, Jr.: “Although it was agreed that the WAR showed great promise, and was a possible replacement for the BAR, the timing of its development could not have been worse. As soon as World War II ended the U.S. Armed Forces halted practically all its arms research and development work, and most procurement. Such work was not resumed until the lessons of World War II had been digested, and by then the .30-caliber Winchester Automatic Rifle was not among the projects resumed.” The WAR, so to speak, was over.



After the conclusion of World War II, Winchester dropped any further development of the G30 variants, including the WAR, due to their rejection by the U.S. military and the perceived lack of viability in the commercial post-war marketplace. Regardless, they represent an interesting, but little-known, chapter in the story of one of America’s most revered firearm manufacturing companies.

      <![CDATA[This remarkable 12-gauge Merkel Model 303 over-under shotgun is thought to have been a gift from Generalissimo Francisco Franco of Spain to Reichmarschall Hermann Göring (1893-1946). The gun, in its French gray leather case, was presented to Göring In Dankbarkeit (In Gratitude) at his famed hunting lodge Carinhall in July 1937.



Göring had been an ace fighter pilot during World War I, having flown with Manfred von Richtofen’s “Flying Circus,” and he was a recipient of the Pour le Merite, better known as the “Blue Max.” Credited with up to 22 aerial victories, Göring was in command of the “Flying Circus” by war’s end. He was an early supporter of Adolph Hitler’s Nazi party and eventually became head of the Luftwaffe and Hitler’s designated successor. Captured in Bavaria in 1945, he was convicted of war crimes during the Nuremburg trials but committed suicide before he could be executed.



This exceptional shotgun includes cased accessories, such as Göring’s field marshal epaulettes, a medallion with Göring’s profile, a sharpshooter’s badge and an embossed cigar case. One of hundreds of firearms “liberated” from various Göring estates at war’s end, this stunning Merkel was presented as a gift from General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower to General of the Armies John J. Pershing in June 1945.



Purchased at auction by Robert E. Petersen, the Merkel is now a part of the Robert E. Petersen Gallery at NRA’s National Firearms Museum in Fairfax, Va. The museum is open seven days a week from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., but is closed Christmas Day.

      <![CDATA[The latest binocular from <a href="http://us.leica-camera.com/sport_optics/" target="_blank">Leica</a> reveals much about how the optics market is changing to keep pace with the current-day shooting culture. Despite containing a significant new development in optical glass-an ingenious hybrid prism-the buzz from early observers centers on the <a href="http://us.leica-camera.com/sport_optics/rangemaster_new/Geovid_new/" target="_blank">Geovid HD-B</a>’s electronic components that should prove particularly useful to long-range shooters and hunters.



In addition to a laser rangefinder, the new bino offers an onboard ballistics computer, inclinometer (measures angle of slope) and digital thermometer/barometer, all of which are integrated to provide shooting solutions to circumstances at hand.



The heart of any binocular is its prisms and two types have dominated, the older Porro style and the now-popular roof prism. Though you never actually see them, it’s easy to deduce the prisms inside from the binocular’s shape. The stair-step look means it’s a Porro, while straight barrels indicate roof prisms. Advances to the latter over the past 20 years have evened optimum performance expectations, but there still are distinct differences. The roof designs are handier, lighter and more durable. But for equal performance-magnification, brightness, clarity and field of view-Porros are less costly.



And so based on its shape, the HD-B is more like a roof-prism but distinctively bowed at mid-barrel because it in fact contains the breakthrough Perger Porro. Like other Porro systems, this one creates fewer internal reflections than roof prisms, and thus fewer chances for light to be “lost” or degraded. However, the redesigned Perger prisms form an elongated shape from which the entering and exiting optical axes are moved closer together, thus reducing the offset that caused previous Porro models to have a clunky profile.



I carried a Geovid HD-B 10x42 during spring turkey season in order to gauge its durability and handling. The unit’s rubber-encased magnesium housing is lightweight but very tough, and despite the electronics Leica guarantees waterproofing to 5 meters. Accordingly, I allowed the bino to get drenched in rain, then dunked it in a bucket and placed it in a freezer-all without effect. As intended, the Leica deployed as easily as any 10x42 roof-prism and much less awkwardly than the standard Porro. At 34.5 ounces, it is hefty, but comparable to other rangefinding models. The open-bridge design promotes comfortable grip during long glassing sessions.



Rangefinding binoculars have come a long way since Leica pioneered the category with the original Geovid in 1992. Effective range and speed are much greater, and there are fewer misreadings. Leica says the HD-B is “rated” to 2,000 yards, with readings in as little as .3 second. This is not the only optic rated to that extreme distance, but the only one I have tested that yielded a reading exceeding it, which came from a silver-painted water tank at 2,095 yards. In more relevant use, I obtained the following maximum readings: rock formation, 1,742 yards; round bale of straw, 1,594 yards; whitetail deer, 1,388 yards; and black bear, 1,337 yards. Readouts appear as a bright red display visible in all light conditions and are controlled via two large buttons on the rear right-hand bridge.



The same display mode delivers the ballistic information, and users have more options here than with any other RF optic. Along with the standard holdover in inches, owners can receive corrections in ¼-MOA clicks. The internal “hard drive” contains 12 ballistic curves to match up with nearly any load, translated in European (meters/centimeters) or U.S. (yards/inches) increments. Users can further modify each curve to three zeroing ranges. Or if the user prefers, he can download his custom ballistic curve via a micro SD card inserted through the battery compartment. We spot-checked the system by comparing it on paper with various loads including: “US1” curve-.300 WSM with Federal Premium 130-grain TTSX zeroed at 200 yards. The recommended holdover at 400 yards was 14 inches or 13 clicks of elevation adjustment. At the range, actual hits (center of 10 shots) struck 12.5 inches lower than point of aim from a 24-inch-barreled Kimber M8400 and 1.5-inch low after adjustments.



"Alternate Ballistics Curve” (downloaded from micro SD card)-.405 Win. with Hornady 300-grain FP zeroed at 100 yards. The recommended holdover at 275 yards was 23 inches. Actual hits from a 22-inch-barreled Ruger No. 1 centered 27.5 inches low.



These results are in keeping with other ballistic compensation devices, and while relatively close to the system’s ballistics calculations, I agree with Leica’s advice that the values should be used as a beginning reference only and subsequently verified on real targets.



Because of geography, we were not able to review all of the HD-B’s ballistic services. Notably missing was a meaningful test of the inclinometer or what Leica calls “equivalent horizontal range.” By noting the angle to the intended target, it provides a corrected range value based on the calculated horizontal path, while also factoring in the chosen ballistics curve and temperature and atmospheric pressure values. For long-range hunters and shooters operating in mountain terrain, these factors can be critical, and I know of no better solution.



Anyone who can follow directions and use a smartphone should be able to employ the HD-B’s many functions. But with just two control buttons, only the exact lengthy sequence will produce the desired result, and any misstep may mean restarting the process. Programming a custom ballistic curve onto a micro SD card is done through a portal at Leica’s website, and though its directions are good, this exercise may require trial and error.



Image quality from the HD-B must be seen to be fully appreciated. Nearly without exception, folks using our test unit vowed it the best ever encountered.



In an effort to quantify the HD-B’s capabilities, I conducted two tests. To measure low-light transmission, we observed from 100 yards how long after sunset a soccer ball’s black and white sections (1.72 square inches) remained distinct. The very best binoculars I have used typically come in at 45 minutes, and the Leica was right there. Later I tested for sharpness by enlisting three volunteers to read headlines like the one on this page at maximum distance. The average was 81 yards, which edged out a couple top European competitors and eclipsed other models by about 10 percent.



Leica touts the 3-D effect of images delivered by its Perger Porro prisms, but of greater practicality to hunters is the resulting increased field of view (FOV), 342 feet at 1,000 yards for the 10x42 version. Except for a few holdout Porro models, FOV from the rest of the pack tops out around 330 feet.



“We felt like we needed a game changer,” announced Leica marketing exec Terry Moore during a press unveiling at the 2013 SHOT Show. “And this is it.”



In fact, the “game” has been changing for the past decade as a growing number of shooters seriously embraces long-range field marksmanship. In that arena, the Geovid HD-B has no peer as a versatile and capable instrument for both imaging and use as a ballistic resource.

    <title>Review: Konus Sight-Pro TR </title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=25778</link>

      <![CDATA[Konus has been familiar to European outdoorsmen since 1979, but it wasn’t until 2006 that the Italian firm brought its optics line to U.S. shores. In a relatively short time the company has established a solid foothold in the market, thanks to the performance of products like the new Sight-Pro TR, a non-magnified reflex sight.



What sets this scope apart is its ability to emit any of four lighted reticles-with no tools required-as well as vary the intensity and color (green or red) for enhanced performance in a variety of lighting conditions. Reticle configurations include a dot that subtends 4 m.o.a., a circle surrounding the same dot, and a small crosshair and a circle with small stadia extending outward at the 3, 6, 9 and 12 o’clock positions.



To change the reticle, simply rotate the knob on the left side of the scope. Adjustment is positive with an audible click, and during what turned out to be some rigorous testing there were no inadvertent changes. Selections are clearly marked on the 0.94"-diameter knob, which is big enough for gloved operation.



The forward-most knob atop the scope powers on the unit, and rotating it changes the color and intensity of the reticle. There are two off positions, marked “G” and “R” for the respective color activated with clockwise rotation of the rheostat. As the knob is turned (clockwise) brightness increases until the reticle disappears with a tactile click after 180 degrees of travel, at the next color position. The knob can turn in both directions, so its color-coded base is a nice touch.



Windage and elevation knobs are where you’d expect them, and both are large enough to facilitate gloved use. Both turrets are nearly 3/4" tall, though, which could be an invitation for unintentional adjustment on a scope with a mission that probably doesn’t include field-expedient dialing for elevation. Setting zero on the tactical turrets was fast and simple, though, so once that’s done a quick glance takes care of the concern. Clicks were positive, tactile and audible, and in “walking the box” on the target, each click resulted in a repeatable 1 m.o.a. shift in point of impact.



The scope’s main body is 35 mm, and it ships with a mount billed as being compatible with small bore or Weaver bases. It fit snugly on a Ruger 10/22 Takedown and held well during range sessions. Despite lacking a lug to lock it into a Picatinny’s grooves, it also clamped right on a SIG Sauer M400 and stayed anchored.



A single CR2032 battery, housed in the rheostat, powers the unit. Reticles were bright, with some ghosting when power output was set at the highest levels. The crosshair seemed to provide the most consistently crisp image. The final test was 30 minutes in the freezer and a trip outside. On a hot, 60-percent-humidity day it should come as no surprise that it fogged. Most scopes do.



No, the Konus Sight-Pro TR probably isn’t ideal if your duty station is in Antarctica, but its rugged, all-metal construction, lifetime replacement warranty, innovative features and budget-friendly price make it a great choice for recreational shooters and even for self-defense.

    <title>I Have This Old Gun: Colt Second Generation Buntline Special .45</title>

      <![CDATA[One of the things Hollywood does well is create legends. And one of the most enduring to come out of the television Westerns of the 1950s and ’60s was the Buntline Special, a Colt Single Action Army with a 12" barrel.



This elongated hogleg made its theatrical appearance in “The Life And Legend Of Wyatt Earp,” which aired on ABC from 1955 to 1961 and starred Hugh O’Brian, who carried it in a Bohlin-made double rig with a holster featuring an extended drop (necessary for the foot-long barrel to clear leather in a timely manner).



But the Colt Buntline wasn’t conjured up by a screenwriter. It was based in fact-sort of. Back in Earp’s day, Colt customers could order extra-long barrels at a dollar an inch for anything over 7½". Approximately 31 such guns-with barrels ranging from 10" to 16"-were produced from 1876 through 1884. However, in Stuart N. Lake’s book, Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshall, upon which the TV series was based, he relates that five of these stretch-tubed SAAs were presented by dime novelist Edward Zane Carroll Judson, who used the pen name Ned Buntline, to Earp and four other Dodge City lawmen-Bat Masterson, Bill Tilghman, Charlie Bassett and Neal Brown-in 1876. Historically, it is doubtful this ever happened, but the story was too good to be ignored.



Just as the TV cowboy craze corralled Colt into reissuing the Single Action Army in 1955, in 1957 “Earpmania” caused the company to bring out a Buntline Special, which remained in the line until 1975, with 4,060 produced. Most were blued and case-hardened with rubber stocks but some had two-piece walnut grip panels and 65 were nickeled.



The guns were serial numbered in the same SA suffix range as standard second generation Peacemakers, but their 12" barrels were stamped “Colt Buntline Special .45.” Buntlines produced through the late 1960s also had a three- or four-digit BB (Buntline Barrel) assembly number on the underside of their barrels. During the 1980s and ’90s many Buntlines were rebarreled, adding to their scarcity. Thus, like all Second Generation Colts, the Buntline has climbed in collectability.



This second-year-of-production Second Generation Buntline is in 98 percent condition, with a barely discernable drag line on the cylinder and a faint hint of holster wear near the muzzle. As such, it easily commands a price of $1,500 to $1,800 on today’s market.



<strong>Gun: Second Generation Colt Single Action Army Buntline Special</strong>

<strong>Caliber:</strong> .45 Colt

<strong>Condition:</strong> 98 percent (NRA Modern-Excellent)

<strong>Serial No:</strong> 216XXSA

<strong>Manufactured:</strong> 1958

<strong>Value:</strong> $1,500 to $1,800

<em>(Note: The BB under-barrel numbers are assembly numbers and are not meant to match Buntline serial numbers.)</em>]]>

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.ruger.com/index.html" target="_blank">Ruger's</a> Red Label shotgun <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/ruger-releases-new-red-label" target="_blank">is back in style</a>. Taken off the market in 2011, the Red Label is back with some modern internal design features and a lower suggested retail price.



On the original shotgun the receiver was cast in two pieces that were then carefully fitted together. The new Red Label features a one-piece receiver, a new balance point and a very nice recoil pad. The good news is that it shoots just as well as ever and the new MSRP is only $1,399. Ruger found a way to save on the cost and is passing it along to the consumer.



Last week, I joined Ken Jorgensen (Ruger's Director of Media Relations) and a number of other folks for a North Dakota pheasant hunt to put the Red Label through its paces. We hunted with the <a href="http://www.cannonballcompany.com/" target="_blank">Cannonball Company</a> outfitters out of Regent, N.D. Due to some bad weather conditions, many thought that the pheasant season would not be nearly as successful as in years past. Well, it may have been a little off, but there were still lots of birds. You just had to know where to find them.



Fortunately for us, Randy Hansen, our Cannonball guide, knew just where to find the roosters. You see, due to the previous bad weather, farmers had not been able to get into the fields and harvest the corn. And those huge cornfields were where the birds were. With eight hunters, Hansen marshaled his troops, established perimeters and put the wild pheasants in a bind. We had plenty of shooting opportunities and collected quite a few birds.



Currently, the Red Label is being shipped in the various 12-gauge offerings. However, I hunted with a 30-inch barreled 20-gauge. Hunters can expect the 20-gauge to be out soon. While I hunted, it absolutely did not seem like I had 30-inch tubes on my gun-which, to me, confirms the new balance point. It was comfortable, handled nicely, and took down pheasants...when I did my part, that is.



Sometimes, “new technology” simply means that a company has cheapened its product. I am pleased to report that this is not the case with the new Ruger Red Label. It is still the great shotgun that we have all enjoyed in the past, and with great wood, too. You get a lot of gun for the money when you hunt with the Ruger Red Label.]]>

    <title>9x23 mm &amp; .357 Sig</title>

      <![CDATA[I watched Sheriff Jim Wilson fire the first round of 9x23 mm JHP ammo into a defenseless block of ordnance gelatin. It was at a writer’s seminar where the gun and cartridge were introduced to the shooting world. Jim may also have been present when another maker brought out its version of ammo for the .357 Sig cartridge. I can’t recall what the good sheriff had to say about these two rounds, but I’ll bet that he has observed the same thing that I have-one made it, one didn’t.



Both calibers were intended to bump up the ballistic performance level of mid-bore pistol cartridges. The 9x23 mm was a .45 ACP-length round intended for single-column M1911-style pistols. Approximately the same length as the .38 Super, the 9x23 was essentially a lengthened 9 mm Luger cartridge. Actually, it had another characteristic that was new to auto pistol design. In order to better handle the higher pressure that would make this so-called “long nine” perform, the case head was deliberately thickened. This gave the base of this cartridge greater mass and strength. It was an approach once tried in Jeff Cooper’s early SWPL days. Initial offerings in 1996 were Colt 1911 pistols, which fired the round with accuracy and power. <a href="http://www.colt.com/" target="_blank">Colt </a>and <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester Ammunition</a> wanted a gun for the IPSC circuit.



In 1994, <a href="http://sigsauer.com/" target="_blank">SIG</a> collaborated with <a href="http://federalpremium.com/" target="_blank">Federal</a> to develop the .357 Sig cartridge. This redoubtable Swiss-German-American firm wanted a powerful medium-bore automatic pistol round that was short enough to comfortably fit in the double-wide magazines of.40 S&amp;W-sized autos. They weren’t going after the gamesmen, but rather the warriors. Working from the already successful .40 S&amp;W case, they necked it down to take 9 mm (not .357 inch) bullets of medium weight. It was a resounding success, achieving velocities in the mid 1,300 fps range. The forgoing description admittedly oversimplifies the cartridge development just a bit. The .357 Sig cartridge works in 9 mm-size pistols, where the bottlenecked case spells ultra-reliable feeding. The cartridge simply works.



Comparing the two is something of an apples-and-oranges thing in the sense that they were really intended for different roles. Whatever the intent, the fact is the 9x23 flopped and is now almost forgotten. And while it is used by a number of prestigious police agencies, the .357 Sig does not enjoy the wide success its designer/developers were seeking.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Shooters are hesitant to buy 'new' cartridges because they might not be around in a few years. And besides, as long as we have the .380, the 9mm, the .40, and the .45, our auto cartridge needs are pretty well covered. Now while that would be the philosophy of our soft-core trigger pullers, the hard-core folks would look to the ballistics for an advantage over the plain-vanilla offerings. The 9x23 and .357 SIG certainly provide more zip than the 9mm but I don't think 9mm fans were ever into power. The .40 shooters can improve their position by going to the full-power version of the 10mm but there's not much choice in guns. And sadly, the .45 Super is all but obsolete. What we need is a new selection of quality pistols chambered in 10mm and .45 Super so that more power is available to those that want it and appreciate it.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Yes, winning hearts and minds over an already accepted cartridge was the story here. The tried and true 38 Super was what these newcomers could only equal, yet couldn’t quite beat. So why change? And so that’s why the action pistol crowd stuck with it to this day. The main factors to consider were  recoil, max pressures, magazine capacity, reliability of feeding, and of course stopping power. Its a big challenge for any newcomer to optimize all this, and come out on top. I remember how the same concept was also tried in the .40 caliber class with 400 Corbon, which is also very good, but couldn’t quite grab a good market share either. I have one, and can attest its every bit as good as my 45ACP. Both the 357 Sig and 400 Corbon are a reloader’s dream, not to mention an easy barrel swap in 1911s, which makes them quite versatile. That plus their ultra reliability of feeding should have easily won them a niche of acceptance. But in the end, what seems like common sense doesn’t always pan out. So 38 Super and 10mm Auto still rule the roost performance wise, in their class. But hey, what can you say. They were here first, and have the home advantage.  Cartridge development, just like firearms, is an evolutionary process. You have to try something new to see what works, and hope it takes off in the public’s eye. One thing for sure, all of these were well thought out, and worth trying. ]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[The 9x23 was a good idea, but why didn't they just take something like 38 SuperComp,  make it better so it could be a drop-in replacement for traditional semi-rimed 38 Super, and release it to the market? I like rimless 38 Super, but the options for shooting it are very limited. To get an inexpensive high capacity model there's pretty much one choice, an EAA Witness. All the other options are custom made 2011s and those are a bit more than the average person is willing to spend. While there are a few things I don't like about the Witness [(]Tanfoglio[)] pistols, their drop-in caliber conversions are awesome. You can get them in 22LR, 9x19, 40S&W, 38Super, 10mm, and 45ACP and they slide onto your existing pistol frame [(]slide to frame fitting and barrel diameter is same for all calibers[)]. These conversions allow you to use calibers like 9x23 and .357 Sig, even though they're not officially offered by the manufacturer, in most cases you just need to ream the barrel and replace the recoil spring. In contrast, most new pistol offerings brought to market are Glock clones that all shoot the same 9/40/45 with very limit options for converting to another caliber, 40S&W/357Sig being the lone exception. This is due to each pistol being specially designed for each caliber, unlike the “lego” mix and match of the Tanfoglio design. If manufactures keep with the current trend, the market will look pretty stagnant and any new cartridge will probably flop because no one wants to buy a new gun specifically designed for a caliber that might not catch on. If only a new barrel was required, then you might be on to something. There aren't many interesting calibers that you can stuff into a small-framed pistol that haven't already been brought to market, non 1911 large-framed pistols is a different story.]]></comment_content>

      <![CDATA[Bushnell has added two new close acquisition 1-4x 24 mm riflescopes to its AR Optics line. The scopes feature true one-power magnification, high-quality optics and target turrets, and fully multi-coated optics. The multi-coated lenses provide excellent light transmission and clarity. The scopes fit perfectly on AR-style rifles, with an overall length just over 9 inches. The riflescopes are built from a durable, one-piece 30 mm tube with target turrets and a fast-focus eyepiece to allow for quick adjustments.



The first model features the new Drop Zone 223 reticle, a bullet-drop compensation (BDC) reticle with a 100-yard zero and aiming points out to 500 yards. The reticle is calibrated for .223/5.56 mm ammunition with a bullet weight range of 55-63 grain. The target turrets have a 1/2 MOA click value. The second model is a first focal plan riflescope featuring the BTR-1 illuminated reticle and a throw-down power change lever. The BTR-1 is an illuminated BDC reticle that functions as a red dot at lower power, but still offers aiming points to 600 yards at full power. The target turrets have a .1 Mil click value.



Available at an estimated retail price of $199.99 and $299.99, you can find more information at <a href="http://www.bushnell.com " target="_blank">Bushnell.com</a>.]]>

      <![CDATA[If you read enough gun magazines or watch any outdoor-themed TV shows, you’ve no doubt noticed that there’s no real shortage of firearm models that are designated “iconic” or “legendary.” And, hey, most of those guns are very much deserving of such superlatives. There are just a select few firearms, however, that have risen to such a level that they receive a moniker all their own. One of them, of course, is the “Gun that Won the West,” more commonly known as the Winchester Model 1873.



Now, nearly a century after being discontinued by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, shooters once again have the opportunity to purchase a Model 1873 that comes complete with the Winchester name stamped on the barrel. The “new” Model 73 is available in two variations-the Model 1873 Short Rifle and the Model 1873 Sporter Case Hardened.

    <title>CVA Introduces New Accura MR Nitride Muzzleloader</title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=25814</link>

    <content_encoded>
      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.cva.com/" target="_blank">CVA</a> has announced the introduction of its new Accura MR Nitride muzzleloader, a premium version of the company's popular <a href="http://www.americanhunter.org/articles/cva-accura-mr" target="_blank">Accura MR</a>. The rifle retains the majority of the features offered by the Accura MR line, but introduces a nitride treated barrel that's meant to take the high-end rifle to a new level-making it the closest thing to a “rust proof” muzzleloader that has ever been developed.



The technique used to treat the barrels is known as Salt Bath Nitride. Already used in military applications, the nitride process hardens the outer layer of the steel, making it more durable and more corrosion resistant than even chrome lining-which was previously the highest standard in bore toughening techniques. Unlike the exterior ceramic coatings, the nitride process protects the outside and the inside of the barrel, and it will not shoot out even with thousands of shots.



With muzzleloaders often being particularly susceptible to corrosion, CVA's application of the nitride technology is meant to reinforce the quality of the company's popular high-end line.



According to Dudley McGarity, CEO of <a href="http://www.bpioutdoors.com/" target="_blank">BPI Outdoors</a>, owner of the CVA brand, the Accura MR Nitride is the result of collaboration among the company’s Pro-Staff members. “We asked them to design the ideal all-around gun for the extreme conditions under which they hunt, and this is what they came up with. The addition of the nitride treatment to the Bergara barrel, is the finishing touch that puts the Accura MR in a class by itself,” McGarity said.



The Accura MR Nitride includes all of the features that made the original Accura MR one of CVA's most popular rifles: The Quick Release Breech Plug (QRBP), the Trigger Guard Actuated Breeching Action, the Bergara Barrel, the Neutral Center of Gravity Trigger and the premium SoftTouch stock with rubber grip panels are all still included.

    <title>Kimber Tactical Entry II .45 ACP Pistol</title>

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.kimberamerica.com/" target="_blank">Kimber</a> recognizes that not all 1911 pistols are used in the same way. Gun collectors look for unique or historically accurate models, while casual target shooters are looking for solid, basic guns at an affordable price. However, for those who step into a law enforcement or military uniform every day, their 1911 sidearms become a vital piece of equipment. To meet the needs of professional operators, Kimber has produced a variety of purpose-built pistols. One of them is the Tactical Entry II full-size 1911 pistol chambered in .45 ACP.



This 1911 pistol successfully blends the custom features many 1911 owners are looking for with the functionality and reliability professionals require to succeed. The matte-black steel slide features front and rear cocking serrations and is topped with a set of low-profile fixed Meprolight Tritium three-dot night sights. The match-grade stainless-steel barrel is 5-inches long, cut with traditional six land-and-groove rifling and is supported in the slide by a stainless-steel match-grade barrel bushing. The recoil assembly consists of a full-length stainless-steel guide rod and a 16-pound round-wire recoil spring.



The stainless-steel frame is treated with the tough KimPro II finish in matte gray and milled with a full-size military-style 1913 Picatinny rail that will accept a variety of light and laser accessories. The mainspring housing and frontstrap of the grip frame are checkered, as is the underside of the traditional round trigger guard. The pistol arrives with a low-profile steel magazine well installed and a blued-steel eight-round magazine fitted with a polymer bumper base pad. The grips are constructed of a gray and brown wood with a double-diamond checkering pattern and the Kimber logo.



The slide release and the round-button magazine release, on the left side of the frame, are both checkered for improved operation. The hammer, a skeletonized combat type, is paired with an extended beavertail grip safety. The ambidextrous thumb safety features short, slim combat-style paddles that ride close to the grip panels. The match-grade aluminum trigger is advertised as leaving the factory with a 4- to 5-pound trigger pull. The digital trigger gauge confirmed the claim, demonstrating a trigger pull of 4 pounds, 12 ounces for this particular pistol.



When packing the Tactical Entry II, I was interested in testing out a carry system that matched the gun's law enforcement and military purpose. One company that understands the need of its professional customers is <a href="http://www.uspeacekeeper.com/index.html" target="_blank">US Peacekeepers</a>. Its Rapid Deployment Pack (RDP) was designed with fast access in mind. The dedicated pistol pocket contains a universal loop-and-hook holster that fits most service-size autos. The exterior pouches are designed to house spare pistol or AR-15 magazines, and the roomy main pocket can be pre-filled at the factory with a tactical first-aid kit. Because the RDP is designed to accommodate a variety of support gear, it could be used as a first-responder kit, a bug-out bag or a concealment system for civilians. These handy bags are available in black, tan or OD green.



Taking the Kimber Tactical Entry II to the shooting range proved to be a real treat. The finish of the pistol was flawless and all of the components showed an excellent level of fit and craftsmanship. All of the controls were snug but smooth in their operation. The tight-fitting slide was smooth to cycle. The white highlights of the three-dot sights were slightly larger than in other systems, which made them easier to see. For those who have smaller hands, like I do, the fine-line checkering of the grip makes all the difference in making a full-size 1911 feel comfortable to shoot.



The trigger was very smooth, with a short, crisp break that's difficult to find in any pistol except for a well built 1911. However, it should be noted that super light triggers like this one require plenty of practice on the range for shooters who are new to the platform before being carried in the field. Heavy triggers require practice in order to keep the pistol on target as the trigger is cycled, but light triggers need to be well-understood so as to avoid touching off a round too soon or unintentionally.



The blued-steel magazine provided with the pistol performed flawlessly, as did a pair of the new <a href="http://www.wilsoncombat.com/new/default.asp" target="_blank">Wilson Combat</a> #500C-HD ETM HD/+P eight-round magazines. The heat-treated MAX flat-wire springs have a maximum strength up to 25 percent stronger than standard springs and are guaranteed to never require replacement, even after high round counts or daily extreme-duty use. With their low-profile steel base pads, these magazines were just the right length to work with the magazine well of the Tactical Entry II.



Taking advantage of the Picatinny accessory rail, the pistol was tested with the new <a href="http://www.streamlight.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Streamlight</a> TLR-2G green laser and light module. The highly visible 522 to 542 nanometer laser emitter has been cleverly placed inside of the LED light housing. This has the dual benefit of setting the laser closer to the bore axis of the pistol while providing the same level of shock, dirt and moisture protection as that of the LED. A single 3V CR123A battery provides 1.5 hours of run time for the 200-Lumen light only, 1.25 hours for the light and laser together or 9 hours for the laser only. This module was easy to install and remained sighted in through the entire testing process.



Formal and informal ammunition testing demonstrated a level of function and accuracy right where they should be for what is advertised as a match-grade service pistol. There were no failures to feed, jams or malfunctions of any other kind while using ammunition ranging from affordable bulk FMJ loads all the way up to premium jacketed hollow points. Accuracy was evaluated using five, five-shot groups fired from a bench rest at 25 yards. The best single group of the formal testing, 2.49 inches, was produced using <a href="http://store.chencustom.com/" target="_blank">ASYM Precision Tactical</a> 230-grain jacketed hollow points. The ASYM load also produced the best average of 2.71 inches, followed by <a href="http://hprammo.com/" target="_blank">HPR</a> HyperClean 185-grain jacketed hollow points with a 2.89-inch average and <a href="http://www.barnesbullets.com/" target="_blank">Barnes Bullets</a> new TAC-XPD all-copper 185-grain +P hollow points at 3.09 inches.



For those who love the 1911 platform, the Kimber Tactical Entry II represents an excellent find for the cost. Currently, this pistol has a suggested price of $1,490, with real world prices that are about $200 less. I've seen folks invest upwards of $3,000 in a custom-built 1911 and not get the level of accuracy this pistol produces right out of the box. It's a handsome gun loaded with features that arrives from the factory ready to go to work. Whether you are looking for a full-size pistol for work or personal protection, this one is a keeper.

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/survey-marks-2nd-year-crime-increases-20669881" target="_blank">Crime has increased</a> over the past two years, according to the 2012 Bureau of Justice Statistics' <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&amp;iid=245" target="_blank">National Crime Victimization Survey</a>. The survey, which is based on a representative sample of U.S. households interviewed twice in one year, also takes into consideration unreported crimes in addition to FBI crime stats.



Unreported crimes are usually of a less-serious nature, but violent crime rose 15 percent in 2012, and simple assaults were up as well. Until now, crime rates had been dropping since 1993, according to FBI statistics. Some experts believe that this means crime rates have bottomed out and that the country might be heading for a surge.



There are many theories on why crime starting dropping in the 90s, such as low inflation keeping the price of goods down and technology helping police solve crimes, as well as why they are rising now. Personally, I can’t help but think that the popularity of concealed carry played its part. Regardless, now is a good time to take a serious look at your self-defense and home-defense plans.



Make the commitment to practice drawing this week with an unloaded handgun from concealment. Double check that doors and windows are secure throughout your home and that everyone remembers his or her assignment in the event of an attack. If you’ve been considering planting some unfriendly plants around windows to discourage access, fall is the time to plant holly bushes in most climates.



Also, if you’ve been thinking about taking a new training course, you might want to make the call. There are a lot of highly skilled <a title="Find a course near you. " href="http://www.nrainstructors.org/searchcourse.aspx" target="_blank">NRA instructors</a> teaching everything from <a title="View the course catalog. " href="http://www.nrainstructors.org/CourseCatalog.aspx" target="_blank">Basic Handgun all the way up to Personal Protection Outside the Home</a>. These are great courses, and even if you have already been certified in a particular discipline, you could learn something new under a different instructor. He or she will at least make you think, a major component of self-defense. Think of self-defense as a life journey; you should always be learning and growing.]]>

      <![CDATA[Just when the dust bunnies had a few cartridges to keep them company on the shelves, news circulated of the Herculaneum, Mo., lead smelter closing at the end of this year. The NRA/ILA website indicates it is <a href="http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/articles/2013/10/end-of-an-era-last-us-lead-smelter-to-close-in-december.aspx" target="_blank">the last lead smelter</a> operating in the United States, although several recycling plants will remain open. Recovering enough metal from batteries and spent cartridges probably won’t be enough to supply recreational shooters, much less fulfill Homeland Security’s <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphbenko/2013/03/11/1-6-billion-rounds-of-ammo-for-homeland-security-its-time-for-a-national-conversation/" target="_blank">1.6 billion round order</a>, though.



The plant’s demise really began in 2008, when the EPA changed air-quality standards for the first time since 1978. These new standards, according to the ILA report, are 10 times tougher than the ones that at the time forced cars to choke down unleaded gasoline and endangered muscle cars.



A <em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em> <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_54400025-2940-5b3f-b753-6e931e596cac.html" target="_blank">story</a> in 2010 reported Doe Run, the company that owns the smelter, had hoped to open a facility nearby that complied with the new regulations. That year $933,000 in property tax revenue was paid by the firm and one official said if the plant closes residents will experience a huge increase in city water bills. A St. Louis PBS affiliate <a href="http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/doe-run-no-new-plant-replace-herculaneum-lead-smelter" target="_blank">indicated</a> in 2012 there would be no new plant and Fox News <a href="http://fox2now.com/2013/10/17/last-us-lead-smelter-closing-in-missouri-145-jobs-lost/" target="_blank">report</a> earlier this month confirmed the doors would be shuttered and 145 people would lose their jobs on Dec. 31. The operation has been in the city for more than 100 years.



So, where will all the lead for bullets and primers come from? China <a href="http://www.indexmundi.com/minerals/?product=lead" target="_blank">produces more lead</a> ore than any other country, with Australia a distant, second-place finisher-at less than half of the metal. The United States is third.



Where our bullet lead originates is one thing, but as of Jan. 1 nearly all of it will have been processed somewhere outside of our nation. Many bloggers are reporting they believe bullet, component and cartridge prices will increase, perhaps initiating another ammunition shortage.



Fortunately, <a href="http://www.barnesbullets.com/" target="_blank">Barnes Bullets</a> has ironed out the wrinkles in lead-free bullet technology. Take a look at the company’s <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13320&amp;cat=27&amp;sub=31" target="_blank">TAC-XPD</a> loads, and more than likely you’ll find something for your self-defense needs. And the terminal performance is so good you may never go back.



So the plant closure won’t make us go defenseless, although accurate, mass-produced lead bullets (seen here being produced in a Discovery Channel <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hkr1NS7bEUU" target="_blank">video</a>) could soon become a collector’s item. As for the Internet claims that shooters are the exclusive target, think again. Fishermen use a lot of lead in their sinkers and jig heads.]]>

        <![CDATA[As I understand the situation, Herculaneum was a primary smelter which is a smelting process that takes mined lead and produces pure lead from the mining product.

What are left in operation are secondary smelters who take lead that has already been produced and is in products such as lead acid batteries and refine it for reuse. No natural element is reused at a rate of zero loss, so eventually the source of recycled lead will reach a point where primary lead will have to be imported to continue having lead products. So, again, as I understand it, skip is correct that there are still smelters working but they are secondary smelters. Herculaneum was the only primary smelter in existence in this country. It was located adjacent to a lead mine which will also be closing as there is no place to refine its product.]]>

        <![CDATA[And Sierra Bullets has place this announcement on its web and Facebook pages:

The main question asked is “Will this shut down your supply of lead.”  The answer to that is no.  First, Sierra buys lead from several different vendors to maintain constant supply.  Second, this facility only smelts primary lead or lead ore.  This is lead ore that has just been brought out of the earth.  Sierra uses no primary lead at all and never has, so we use nothing directly from this facility.  The lead we buy from Doe Run comes from their recycling facility in Boss, MO that is about 90 miles away from the smelter that is closing.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Sierra Bullet's response sounds as if it comes from a politician. Sure they are buying their lead from several vendors, but as I pointed out in my first post, no resource is recycled at 100[%]. At some date in the future, whether it is six months or six years, raw material in the form of pure lead from a mined source will have to be introduced into the supply stream. Now, whether it will come from Mexico, China or Australia is the first question and the second question is at what added cost to the end consumer. It sounds as if ranges need to step up their reclamation processes if the lead supply is to remain reasonable. How about depleted uranium? The feds are having a lot of trouble getting rid of their depleted uranium now that Nevada told them they couldn't dump it there. With depleted uranium you could probably fire your .223 with a 150 grain bullet with a 1 in 9 twist rate. If you were man enough, you could fire 750 grain bullets out of your .45 ACP.]]></comment_content>

      <![CDATA[On my first solo flight at K-13, Suwan, Korea, in June 1952, I took off in an F-80 Shooting Star. It was not a combat mission. All I had to do was go up and have fun boring holes in the sky for about an hour and a half.



Immediately after takeoff, I felt the left wing was heavy and determined that the left tip fuel tank was not feeding properly, or at all. Afraid it might fall off and rupture during landing, potentially melting asphalt on the runway, the tower would not let me land with the full tank. I was instructed to make a bomb run and drop the whole tank.



Arriving at the bomb range, I set up my bomb-release switches to release the tank. Flying over the impact area I pushed the button, but nothing happened. I tried a second time and again there was no response. On my next pass, I tried the manual release handle but to no avail. Making one final run, I used the button we called the “panic button” because it allegedly released everything hanging on the airplane. It worked as advertised and dumped everything, save my errant left tip tank.



The tower control officer advised me that if I couldn’t get rid of the tank or its contents, I should give them my location, eject and await pick up. Well, pilots really hate to punch out of a perfectly flyable airplane, and I figured I still had one option worth trying.



The canopy of an F-80 can be opened in flight up to about 220 m.p.h. So, I opened the canopy and unholstered my G.I.-issue Colt M1911. Now, liquid fuel will not burn, at least not like vapors, so I aimed for the part of the tank I was sure would be full of liquid. Firing my first shot I had no idea where the bullet went-perhaps airborne, high-speed physics were at work, or maybe just my nerves. But my next three shots punctured the tank, passed through the fuel, and exited cleanly out the far side of the 24-inch-wide tank.



For the next 30 minutes, I flew with the left wing down in a series of circles to drain the fuel and slowly return to base. By the time I got to the airstrip the tank was empty, and I made a routine landing. As far as I know, I am the only pilot in the Air Force who ever shot his own plane to correct a malfunction.



Thank goodness for my .45.

      <![CDATA[While walking down the sidewalk, a military service member was assaulted by a man he did not know. As he was walking around 3 p.m., he was approached by a stranger, who proceeded to verbally assault him before physically striking him in the head. The attack was reportedly unprovoked. The service member, also a concealed-carry permit holder, pulled out his firearm detaining the assailant until police arrived and arrested him. (<em><a href="http://www.theolympian.com/" target="_blank">The Olympian</a></em>, Olympia, WA, 5/31/13)



A man who authorities say was hallucinating and talking about zombies broke into an Orange County home where he was fatally shot by the homeowner. The couple awoke to hear the intruder screaming in their backyard and the wife called 911 as her husband confronted him. The intruder threatened the couple and broke into the home by shattering a rear sliding glass door. The husband then fatally shot the intruder. (<a href="http://www.fresnobee.com/" target="_blank">Fresnobee.com</a>, Yorba Linda, CA, 10/29/13)



<strong>From The Armed Citizen Archives</strong>

<em>October 1983</em>: A would-be rapist awoke Claudine Hale in her Baltimore apartment, grabbed her by the throat and threatened to harm the children sleeping in the same room. Hale struggled with the assailant, then managed to reach a handgun, which she used to halt the attack. He fled after being shot, and a suspect was found dead nearby. Baltimore authorities declined to press charges against the woman. (<em>The Evening Sun</em>, Baltimore, Md.)]]>

      <![CDATA[In my treasure box of gun-related stuff (actually the detritus of a hundred other guys’ boxes), I have an unusual set of revolver grips. I would like to ask my readers, particularly in the East, to help me identify them.



They are plain, checkered service grips for a Colt I Frame revolver (Python, Trooper, OMM, Official Police). Made of plastic, they are the basic service grip used on police revolvers, except for the fact that they are bright fire engine red.



The story that came with the grips was that they were issued to rookie cops who had yet to pass their probation. As they went about their business, the bright red grips served to instantly identify them as persons not completely trained in every aspect of police work. I do not know if, where, when and why this happened, but I would appreciate any reader who can fill in the blank spots in the story to do so. Let’s hear from you, guys.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Sounds to me like an early variant of the 'red gun' we currently use for demos and handling training. Glock has a factory version, while other makes are often made by de-milling worn service pistols. The current trend is to paint the entire gun red, but during my a academy days, we saw a number of guns with just the grips colored red.

    <title>Barnes Bullets TAC-XPD Defensive Handgun Cartridges</title>

      <![CDATA[Fred Barnes launched <a href="http://www.barnesbullets.com/" target="_blank">Barnes Bullets</a> from a basement workshop in Bayfield, Colo., in 1932. The bullets he produced were constructed by surrounding a solid, pure-lead core with a thick jacket formed from copper tubing. These bullets were prized by hunters who bought them because of their dependable performance.



In 1974, the company was purchased by Randi and Coni Brooks with a plan to continue and expand upon Fred's legacy. The Brooks family worked diligently to grow the company using the lead core bullets they inherited, but Randy had an idea that inspired him to experiment with an all-copper bullet design. His goal was to produce a projectile that would expand rapidly, penetrate deeply and hold together when used for hunting the largest, toughest game. His work resulted in the release of the X Bullet in 1989. More than 20 years later, the company is still going strong with its current lines of all-copper bullets, including such offerings as the polymer-tipped TSX and LRX bullets for rifles, and the TAC-XP bullets for pistols.



Historically, Barnes has focused on providing bullets for both reloaders and ammunition manufacturers. About three years ago, Barnes decided to step into the factory-loaded cartridge market with its VOR-TX line of rifle, handgun and Safari ammunition. Following the success of this line, the company has launched a new-for-2013 line of self-defense handgun cartridges, the Barnes TAC-XPD.



Barnes' TAC-XP bullets for handguns have been hot sellers with top ammunition makers for some time, such as <a href="http://store.chencustom.com/" target="_blank">ASYM Precision</a>, <a href="https://www.buffalobore.com/" target="_blank">Buffalo Bore</a> and <a href="http://www.doubletapammo.net/" target="_blank">DoubleTap</a> to name a few. Designed for use in law enforcement and personal-defense applications, this bullet contains a large, deep hollow-point cavity that expands and penetrates consistently. The all-copper construction allows them to maintain their original weight and to fly true, even after passing through intermediate barriers such as car doors, plywood and automotive windshield glass.



To get the ball rolling on this new line of products, Barnes launched its TAC-XPD ammunition in four loadings-an 80-grain .380 ACP, a 9 mm +P with a 115-grain bullet, a 140-grain .40 S&amp;W load and a .45 ACP +P topped with a 185-grain bullet. The cases are nickel-coated for smooth operation, and the copper bullets are coated with black nickel to give them a distinctive appearance.



I had the opportunity to begin testing this new defensive-handgun ammunition with a visit to the Barnes Bullets factory, located in Mona, Utah. Along with impressive tool making, manufacturing and quality control centers, Barnes maintains a world-class ballistics and bullet testing laboratory. The setup and staff are so well respected that the company often leases them out to gun manufacturers and government agencies for product testing.



It was in this laboratory setting that I had the opportunity to belly up to a shooting bench and test fire the 185-grain .45 ACP +P TAC-XPD load. The round was fired from a benchrest using a Colt 1911 pistol with a 5-inch barrel. The test medium was 10 percent ordinance gelatin positioned 10 yards from the muzzle of the pistol and covered with four layers of denim. Both the distance of the gel blocks and the thickness of the fabric layers exceeded FBI testing requirements. At 10 yards (instead of 10 feet), the bullet penetrated 14 inches into the gel, yielding a maximum expansion of 0.763 inches. This was impressive, to say the least.



But as useful as laboratory results can be, it seemed logical to conduct additional testing out in the field. So arrangements were made for off-site testing of all four of the new TAC-XPD loadings. In order to mix things up a bit, the test-gun set included two tried-and-true personal pistols (Glock G23 .40 S&amp;W and a Colt Government Model .380 ACP) and two factory-fresh test guns (<a title="Read the full review on the Kimber Tactical Entry II." href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/kimber-tactical-entry-ii-45acp-pistol" target="_blank">Kimber Tactical Entry II .45 ACP</a> and a TriStar T-120 9 mm). This test set had the advantage of representing guns that were old and new, imported and domestic, with sizes ranging from pocket pistol to full-size duty arms. Velocity was checked by firing 10-rounds over a CED M2 chronograph at 10-feet, while accuracy for all gun and ammunition combinations was verified by firing five consecutive, five-shot groups into targets at 25 yards.



The now discontinued <a title="Learn more about the Colt Government .380. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=14056&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=21" target="_blank">Colt Government .380</a> with a 3.25-inch barrel has been a family favorite for years. Having proven to be quite accurate in the past, this pistol and ammunition combination outshot the larger handguns with the smallest five-shot group of the entire test, 2.2 inches. It averaged 2.55-inch groups with the 80-grain TAC-XP. Recoil was modest and manageable, suggesting that the .380 ACP load will be a good choice for the myriad of pocket .380s currently on the market. The fastest round of the test was the .40 S&amp;W load fired from the 4.02-inch barrel of a Glock G23. The 10-shot average was 1,100 fps, which was only 20-feet below the published velocity.



Overall, accuracy from all the guns was excellent. The reliability required for defensive ammunition was certainly evident as there was not a single jam, failure to feed, failure to eject or misfire in the entire group.



Branching out into a new facet of the shooting industry could be a challenge for some companies. Sometimes it takes a while to work out all of the kinks and bugs before a product is at its best. This, however, is not the case for Barnes Bullets and its new TAC-XPD line of self-defense ammunition. The same dedication to quality that has made its bullets world famous is evident in the care that's been taken in developing and producing these new, fully loaded cartridges. This ammunition demonstrated a high level of performance, accuracy and reliability. Choosing handgun ammunition for personal protection requires some serious thought and testing, but the TAC-XPD is an excellent new option for semi-auto pistol owners. I’m looking forward to using this ammunition in the future, and hopefully we can anticipate the continued growth of this ammunition line with the addition of more calibers.

        <![CDATA[ That was a good article but there is something missing. How do these bullets preform going through denim and into Ballistic gelatin [(]I know this is just a medium and may not indicate performance on the streets[)]. I am looking for a good .380 carry/home defense cartridge. This article tells how accurate and the velocity of this ammo, but it tells nothing of how well the bullet expands or how deep it penetrates.



If your going to write an article on defensive ammunition, shouldn't you include how well the bullet preforms? Either they don't preform well, so that part of the article was left out on purpose to promote a particular brand of ammunition. Or maybe Mr Horman didn't feel it necessary to complete his review of this ammunition, or didn't think it was necessary.



So while I thought it was a good article, it is not complete. How is a person supposed to decide on something so important without all of the facts. Please in the future if your going to write such articles, I ask that you do a complete review. Thank you.<!--mobile-->]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Bigfoot, I checked the Buffalo Bore web site out.  That article and one done by American Rifleman on handgun stopping power, August 2012, [(]http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id[=]13419&cat[=]20&sub[=]21&q[=]2[)] showed me why I want an expanding bullet.  It causes more damage and is less likely to over penetrate than a  solid bullet.  The bullet that Buffalo Bore [(]27A[)] advertises Penetrates over 24' with nearly no expansion [(]per the data in the American Rifleman article[)].  That could penetrate through 2 human bodies and keep going.  I would rather my bullet not penetrate far enough, than penetrate that far and endanger anything beyond my target [(]another person behind a Sheetrock wall not seen.  Now explain that one to an innocent persons family[)].  Thank you for your info though.  I can make a better choice on my ammunition when I have more information to digest.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[PART 1 Brad: While that 24 inches of penetration might look like too much, consider the FBI findings on the subject of penetration: 'It is essential to bear in mind that the single most critical factor remains penetration. While penetration up to 18 inches is preferable, a handgun bullet MUST reliably penetrate 12 inches of soft body tissue at a minimum, regardless of whether it expands or not. IF THE BULLET DOES NOT RELIABLY PENETRATE TO THESE DEPTHS, IT IS NOT AN EFFECTIVE BULLET FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT USE.' The test you refer to was penetration in 10[%] ballistic gelatin without any barriers. If you expect your target to be wearing heavy winter clothing and to have skin, ribs, sternum, or arms in front of his heart and lung region, your bullet is going to expend a lot of its penetration potential before it even enters the body.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[PART 2 Finally, here are their words on over penetration: 'An issue that must be addressed is the fear of over penetration widely expressed on the part of law enforcement. The concern that a bullet would pass through the body of a subject and injure an innocent bystander is clearly exaggerated. Any review of law enforcement shooting will reveal that the great majority of shots fired by officers do not hit any subjects at all. It should be obvious that the relatively few shots that do hit a subject are not somehow more dangerous to bystanders than the shots that miss the subject entirely. Also, a bullet that completely penetrates a subject will give up a great deal of energy doing so. The skin on the exit side of the body is tough and flexible. Experiments have shown that it has the same resistance to bullet passage as approximately four inches of muscle tissue. Choosing a bullet because of relatively shallow penetration will seriously compromise weapon effectiveness, and needlessly endanger the lives of the law enforcement officers using it. No law enforcement officer has lost his life because a bullet over penetrated his adversary, and virtually none have ever been sued for hitting an innocent bystander through an adversary. On the other hand, tragically large numbers of officers have been killed because their bullets did not penetrate deeply enough.'    ]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Bigfoot, I think you miss my point on my first post.  I want to know how THAT particular ammo preforms.  Maybe it DOES penetrate to acceptable depths, but we don't know because of an incomplete test!  A bullet that passes through its target has wasted energy.  Ideally that bullet should just fall out the other side of a body, meaning all of the bullets energy  was expended inside of the target, causing the most damage. In your lone reference, you state and I quote, ' IF THE BULLET DOES NOT RELIABLY PENETRATE TO THESE DEPTHS, IT IS NOT AN EFFECTIVE BULLET FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT USE!'  Well neither me or my wife are law enforcement. The rules for law enforcement don't always apply to us citizens.  You assume that every altercation ends in firing your weapon.  It has been proven that just aiming your gun at the offending person ends the conflict. Also, your quoted statement is untrue, 'If you expect your target to be wearing heavy winter clothing and to have skin, ribs, sternum, or arms in front of his heart and lung region, your bullet is going to expend a lot of its penetration potential before it even enters the body.'  The last time I checked the skin, ribs, sternum, and arms ARE ALL part of the body silly!!  Hitting and arm and breaking it has the potential to end hostilities.  Some people will stop fighting at the sight blood and a hole in them.  You don't have to kill someone to win a fight.  You also win when the other person stops fighting and you have control. Listen, I know the .380ACP cartridge is marginal at best for defensive purposes.  My wife is petite and doesn't like the recoil of the bigger cartridges.  So this is a trade off for a bigger caliber gun that she flinches with, to a softer shooting cartridge in a Ruger LC380, that she can put on target swiftly and repeatedly.  I just prefer a bullet that will expand AND penetrate that minimum 12' against a bullet that can easily pass through a body with NO expansion.  Again, Thank you for your input.  I do appreciate others advise, and my freedom to agree or disagree with them.]]></comment_content>

So, I don't understand why Brad finds Bigfoot's replies objectionable.  Why will the expanding hollow point cartridges by Barnes Bullets TAC-XPD not satisfy Brad's needs?

Let's all have a Coke and a smile!!!]]>

      <![CDATA[Ontario Knife Co. began supplying the U.S. military with knives, specifically an 18-inch-bladed machete, during World War II. Since then the company has been contracted by various branches to make a number of designs-including the stainless steel-bladed Mark 3 Navy knife, the Blackbird SR5 bushcrafter’s knife and the Marine Corps bayonet with an 8-inch blade of proprietary steel.



Other Ontario-produced military-issue knives include the Aircrew Survival Egress Knife (ACSEK), and its predecessor, the Air Force Survival Knife. Of course the company still catalogs other military mainstays such as the Marine Combat Knife and the 1-18 Machete that started it all. In addition, Ontario carries other classic and modern designs, such as its value-priced Spec Plus series, that make use of tried-and-true materials such as high-carbon 1095 steel for blades, Kraton for handles and Cordura nylon for sheaths.

      <![CDATA[More than a half million <a href="http://www.remington.com/en/products/archived/rimfire/bolt-action/model-510-targetmaster.aspx" target="_blank">TargetMasters</a>  were produced by<a href="http://www.remington.com/" target="_blank"> Remington</a> between 1939 and 1962. One of them hangs on my wall as a family heirloom with scars from decades of hunting and two generations of the family-soon to be three-learning the finer points of marksmanship behind its trigger. Odds are pretty good you, or a shooting friend, own at least one TargetMaster 510 variation.



If not, they’re usually a pretty good deal at only about $129, depending on condition. It won’t come with your family history attached, but if you enjoy accurate rimfires it’ll soon earn one.



There are some devoted fans of the TargetMaster 510 posting on the Internet, but finding confirmable details is like trying to find Bigfoot. One of the best sources I found is the “The History of Remington Firearms,” by Roy Marcot.



According to Marcot, Remington’s entire 500 series of rifles shared a cost-saving receiver, “…made from seamless drawn steel tubing, not more expensive forged steel.” The lineup included the 510, 511 (basically a 510 with a magazine), 512, 513 and semi-automatic 550.



The 510A first reached shooters in March, 1939. An improved version was also available with “…a chrome-plated bolt, bolt handle and trigger,” according to Marcot. It looks like my father actually splurged for the extra touch, a rarity in our family.



My 510A’s chrome finish shows years of use and abuse. My father used it regularly for squirrels and rabbits-it was, after all, a working gun. The trigger has vertical serrations on its face to enhance purchase with gloves or inclement weather. Its let-off weight is 3.5 pounds, but bear in mind I’ve been soaking, cleaning and polishing this thing for the past seven months (and as the photo indicates, it still doesn’t look pristine).



Marcot said 501As weigh 4 pounds, 12 ounces, but my rifle is slightly lighter because it is missing the buttplate, although I remedied the problem by ordering one from <a href="https://www.gunpartscorp.com/Products/83480F.htm" target="_blank">Numrich</a>.



There is no serial number on this 510A. The Gun Control Act of 1968 requires serial numbers on firearms made after its enactment, but the 510A lineup was discontinued in December, 1962, long before it was mandatory. You can determine a 510’s year of manufacture, however, by checking the letters on the left side of the receiver. The Remington Society has a convenient cross-reference <a href="http://www.remingtonsociety.com/questions/BLACKPOWDERX.htm" target="_blank">page</a>. Mine was made in June of 1949.



The single-shot 510A is versatile enough to digest .22 Short, .22 Long and .22 Long Rifle. The bolt cocks on opening, whereupon a small red indicator (mine used to be red) protrudes at the back to indicate its status. It has double locking lugs, dual extractors and in all the times afield with my father, it never suffered a stoppage of any sort. A manual safety at the right rear of the receiver has horizontal serrations for added grip-forward to fire, exposing a small red dot, back to engage the safety.



Those accustomed to modern bolt-action rifles will probably find the 510A a little less than hand-filling. It’s thin. The stock is less than 1.5 inches at its widest at the butt, and the front of the fore-end measures slightly more than an inch. It’s sounds spindly, but it’s awesome for a .22, and even better when you’re putting it in the hands of a novice for the first time. My father called it nimble. Whether you like the dimensions or not, the good old American walnut has stood up to 64 years of beating. There is no checkering. Overall length (sans buttplate) is 42 3/4 inches.



A very small crown protects the 25-inch barrel’s rifling. Barrel diameter at the muzzle is .6 of an inch. Stock sights are fixed up front, and windage and elevation adjustable at the rear, according to Marcot. My version has a dovetailed front sight, perhaps yet another artifact from Uncle Johnny, the family’s precision machinist (although the setup is identical to the ScoreMaster also hanging on my wall).



My father’s condition for the last 10 years of his life relegated the rifle to the safe. The barrel didn’t get much maintenance during that period, so it needs more cleaning/conditioning before it undergoes a real accuracy test. In the meantime, I’ll add to the Sasquatch/TargetMaster folklore by the unsubstantiated claim that my father never missed with this rifle. He probably did and I just wasn’t there to witness it, but either way, I can’t wait to put this refurbished TargetMaster in the hands of my youngest grandson. Then I’ll get to work on the other Remington.]]>

      <![CDATA[A close friend of mine, like many Americans, recently made the choice to buy his first handgun. After doing methodical research online, he approached me for some firsthand advice. There is so much conflicting information on all the blogs and forums, he was confused about who to believe. A guy posting online at 3 a.m. may be a top personal protection instructor that has trained Tier One operators, but he may not be. Lots of excellent, thoughtful advice comes from folks online, but so does advice that merely advocates or self-validates the usually anonymous person’s point of view.



So I went through my checklist. Odds are if you are an avid shooter, you have been asked or will be asked the same questions. Without getting into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson-LaGarde_Tests">Thompson-LaGarde</a> tests or chronicling the development of recoil-operation, here is how I broke it down, followed by his responses.



<strong>1. First things first, what do you want it for?</strong>

Personal protection and recreational target shooting.



<strong>2. Do you understand that there are serious considerations regarding using a firearm for personal protection?</strong>

Yes, I understand and have thought it through; really that is why I am at this point.



<strong>3. Do you want it as a carry gun?</strong>

No. I may later, but not right now.



<strong>4. How and where do you plan to store it?</strong>

I will keep it loaded in a lock box in my bedroom



<strong>5. What cartridge do you want it to chamber?</strong>

I think 9 mm Luger, as I want to make sure my wife can be comfortable with it.



<strong>6. Do you want a revolver or a semi-automatic?</strong>

Semi-automatic. I like how they feel in the hand. Revolvers seem bulky to me.



<strong>7. Do you want a “standard” magazine capacity, meaning more than 10 rounds in a duty gun?</strong>

Yes, it seems to me having more than I may need is better than not having enough.



<strong>8. Do you have your mind made up about what your frame should be made of, i.e., polymer, aluminum or stee</strong>l?

Doesn’t matter. It just has to fit my hand, but still fit my wife’s hand as well.



<strong>9. Do want a double-action, a single-action or a striker-fired gun?</strong>

I am not really sure what all those terms mean, but I think I want a double-action (<em>which after a bit of explaining, meant he wanted a conventional double-action/single-action</em>).



<strong>10. Do you want a manual safety or do you want to rely on internal safety and the trigger pull weight-as well as safe gun handling-to make sure it only fires when you want it to do so?</strong>

Manual safety; it can’t hurt.



<strong>11. Do you want a gun with an external hammer?</strong>

I think an external hammer, because I can cock it manually if I have time for a better trigger pull, like on the range.



<strong>12. How much do you want to spend?</strong>

About $500.



<strong>13. Do you want to attach accessories to the gun, such as a flashlight or a laser?</strong>

Yes, maybe both, but probably I will put a light on it.



<strong>14. What kind of sights do you want?</strong>

I think night sights. Bad guys often break in at night, right?



<strong>15. Do you want sights that are adjustable, in particular for when you just go the range?</strong>

Well, yes, especially if it doesn’t hit where I point.



<strong>16. Do you want a grip frame that can adjust to hand size, i.e., having backstrap panels that can adapt to your wife’s hands?</strong>

Yes. It will be mostly my gun, but I would like my wife to be able to get her hands around it, too.



<strong>17. Is where it is made important to you, meaning made in the United States?</strong>

Yes and no. All things being equal, I would take a U.S.-made gun.



<strong>18. What barrel length do you want?</strong>

I think four or five inch, a full-size gun.



<strong>19. Do you want new or used?</strong>

If it is a newer gun in good shape, I would be OK with used.



<strong>20. Are you willing to take an <a title="Find a course near you. " href="http://www.nrainstructors.org/searchcourse.aspx" target="_blank">NRA Basic Pistol Course</a> if I help you out?</strong>

Yes, I wanted to take one with my wife and daughter anyway.



The result of this conversation led to a field trip to the <a href="http://thenationsgunshow.com">Nation’s Gun Show</a> in Chantilly, Va. I often recommend trying a gun out at a place that rents guns and has a range that you can try before you buy (is “SIG having a sign and shoot event” this weekend on end-of-year models?), but in this case it wasn’t necessary. The full-size, 9 mm Luger duty gun with an external hammer eliminated a lot of guns from the potential purpose list. Remaining were Berettas, CZ-75 based guns, FNs, H&amp;Ks and SIG Sauers. So we looked at each of those. The <a href="http://www.hk-usa.com/index.asp" target="_blank">H&amp;K</a> and the <a href="http://sigsauer.com/" target="_blank">SIG</a> were knocked out due to price (although they would have been at the top of his list if the budget were larger). The <a href="http://www.berettausa.com/" target="_blank">Berettas</a> were still a little above his budget, but he could not find a Model 92 he liked for the price, and he wasn’t interested in the CZs.



He ended up with a 9 mm <a href="http://www.fnhusa.com/" target="_blank">FN-USA</a> FNX hammer gun with interchangeable backstrap inserts, drift-adjustable night sights and an accessory rail that was slightly used and came with three magazines. And he had enough cash left over for 100 rounds of <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester </a>white box ammunition.



Asking the right questions may be the best advice you can ever give a friend.]]>

        <![CDATA[Seems a little advanced for a first time gun buyer - much more aimed at someone with gun experience, but just doesn't own a handgun yet. Like 'what cartridge do you want' - what if they know nothing nothing about the different cartridges. A better one one be 'do you know about different handgun cartridges?' 

But anything that will help stop gun store sales people pushing ultralight magnums on first time buyers looking for home protection handgun is a positive!]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Those are good questions but ultimately useless for this reason:  range time will change their mind as to what they think they want.  I've found in teaching others to shoot that if it doesn't fit their hand, their physical abilities, their true sense of how a firearm should shoot then a lot of those answers are going to change.  They may learn to hate external hammers and a manual safety.  They might like the smoothness or build quality of one firearm over another.  They may appreciate the ergonomic features between manufacturers.  A great example:  Many, Many gun reviewers hate the trigger guard magazine release style of some of the German manufacturers.  So I didn't pay them any mind . . . until I shot them.  I loved them immediately and many students who've borrowed mine have commented on how smart the design function is.  Range time beats any Q/A.  ]]></comment_content>

1. What do you want it for?

3.  have you ever shot a handgun?  

Now go pick the biggest one you can shoot accurately 30 times.  If you can't shoot it accurately 30 times, go to a smaller caliber.  Rinse, repeat.]]>

Firster's should go to a local gun range and confess to the folk there that they are gun-grip virgins and take the basic course for safety and range firing a mix of revolver and semi-auto handguns.  Feel it.  See it.  HEAR it.  Smell it.  Then, find a fit not only for the hand but for the intent.  Savings not only in dollars but in peace of mind will ensue.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[For a complete newbie, I'd say the Basic Pistol Course should be recommended in advance of any purchase. Also on the agenda before or leading up to purchase would be, in my recommendation, a trip to a range where many different types of firearms and different grip styles on each may be rented and ultimately fired. There IS really no answer though. S&W j, k and N frames with good grips fit my hand well, as well as the PPK/S Walther and the 1911 Colt. Yet I shoot many more rounds through single actions in Sass matches, and they always beat me up. The answer is, 'have SOMETHING'! My 638 Smith in my pocket is much better when needed , than all 7 of my .45s locked in the Safe!]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[Any time personal protection comes up in the discussion a person needs to be conscious of the responsibility they take on as a mentor.  While it is ultimately the end user who selects, trains with and evaluates a pistol for their needs, a good mentor plays a role in getting a new shooter pointed in the right direction. 

With that said - while we want a new shooter to have a positive first encounter - a mentor needs to be prepared to assess how acceptable a pistol is for the new shooter's and anticipate that the new shooter lacks the experience and awareness required to answer questions that most experienced shooters figured out for themselves a long way back [(]action type, caliber, material, etc.[)]]]>

I put so many rounds through it at the range that I can get groups the size of a quarter if  I need to. shooting for speed, that opens up to about a six inch spread. 30 years later, and I own more than few guns, but that Ruger is still my favorite.

        <![CDATA[I'm currently looking to purchase my first hand gun as well. It will be my carry weapon, an used for all around purposes. From the research iv done, an people I know that already own i narrowed it down pretty quickly. I would never trust my life to any 9mm ever - Just not enough stopping power. It will either be a glock 45 or a fn's 45.  Mostlikely the Glock since the difference in price. Personally, I can't see owning anything less then a 40. What is all of your thoughts ?

        <![CDATA[For the first time gun buyer there is no question that a double action revolver is the way to go.  Even more so if the firearm is going to be used as a self defense weapon.  In the event of a failure to fire the remedy for a revolver is already known, simply pull the trigger again.  Not so with an automatic!  In the event of a failure to fire [(]or any other malfunction i.e. a stovepipe[)] using an automatic the procedure is much more complicated and not to mention requires two hands!  

Even if the shooter is experienced and is planning to use the firearm partly for self defense there is no doubt that a double action revolver will be the most reliable and easiest to use if or when a VERY stressful situation arises.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I'm not sure that giving someone a double action revolver for their first gun is always a good idea.  Yes, the gun is simpler to operate and maintain, but it's also heavier if you're shooting something like a .38 Special.  The capacity is less than that of a semi-auto, and you have to either pull the hammer back to advance the cylinder or else squeeze harder to do so in double-action.  I'd much prefer a 1911 style semi-auto for personal protection.  ]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Ryan, 9MM is perfectly suitable for self defense. I'm as much of a fan of .45 as the next guy, but 9MM will do the job just as well. It is all about shot placement and penetration. With proper self defense ammo -which any gun being used for self defense should be loaded with- there is little difference between the effects of 9MM and .45 ACP. As far as .40 goes, IMO it is a solution to a question that no one really asked. When all is said and done however, the choice is up to you. Buy what you want, practice with it and if possible get formal training with it. ]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[I'm a retired Deputy Sheriff, with 30  yrs of service. Very pro gun ownership. I was asked by a member of my bible study group about type of firearm for home defense. The first question I asked was,' do you have the mind set to protect yourself and loved ones, against  great bodily harm, from an aggressor. And  in the process of stopping, with center mass shots, take the intruders  life?' If there is a pause in the conversation,the answer was you probably need to reconsider the need.  My suggestion is usually a youth size 20 ga pump shotgun using heavy bird shot # 6 or # 4. It will not exit most walls, does not require as much range time to stay proficient, and at close, range in an average house provides great stopping power. Importantly it does not require a round in the chamber when loaded providing safer storage.
As to a handgun, a new owner should think about a basic double action revolver if they will take the time to become proficient in its use. 

And lastly, do not use the advice of our current vice president,' to fire through the door'

      <comment_content><![CDATA[The first question should have been 'how much time, money and effort are you willing to put into becoming proficient with a handgun?'  If the answer isn't 'a lot', then perhaps you need to rethink your needs.  Skill takes practice.  A good 22 remains a good choice for a first gun because of cost and recoil....if you can't master shot placement with a small round, a larger one won't land on target any better.  Semi-autos have a larger learning curve than revolvers...is EVERYONE who is likely to handle the weapon willing to put in the time to learn it?  If you feel you 'need' more than 6 or 8 shots, you should ask yourself if you are planning on self defense or getting into a gun fight.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I noticed a number of comments suggest shooting different guns at a range to see which one you prefer.  I agree that that may be a good idea, but if you live in a very rural area that may not be a reasonable option.  I live in northwest Kansas and I dont even know where the nearest gun range that rents guns is located.  I would not be surprised if it was a 4-7 hour drive to the nearest range where you could rent a gun.  Denver would be about a 4 hour drive one way.  Wichita would be about a 5 hour drive and KC would be about 7 hours.  Too bad there are not some nearer to where I live.  It may have kept me from purchasing a S&W .380 Bodyguard.  I know have a S&W 9 mm Shield that I like.]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[Looks like many of the the questions my wife and I asked ourselves before buying our first guns earlier this year.
We went with a Walther PPQ 9mm and a PK380 [(]which changed from it originally being 2 PPQs because my wife liked the smaller profile and lighter recoil of the PK as her future carry weapon[)].]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Ryan as for the 9mm it has come a long way in the past 25yrs or so. If you look at recent stories George Zimmerman took down Travon with 1 shot from his 9mm. Its all about placement of the shot and handling the firearm during recoil for a follow up shot if needed. A 45 may be good for you to handle but some women like my ex-wife couldnt handle the recoil of my 45 but was comfortable with the 9mm. Buying firearms is like buying clothes what might look good on you may not on someone else, its all personal.<!--mobile-->]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[Given equal availability of handguns, I would recommend a Smith & Wesson Model 64. Stainless steel, .38 Special +P, four-inch barrel. Small-frame revolvers, especially snub-noses, are advanced courses, not beginner's handguns.

Why the M64? Reliable, easy-to-use, easy to check condition [(]loaded/unloaded[)], heavy enough to absorb recoil for quicker follow-up shots and a host of grips available to suit hand size.

.38 Special +P in a good loading is a more than adequate round for close-quarters self defense. Even the much-touted .45 isn't a guaranteed one-shot man-stopper and the 1911-style pistol has to be kept cocked-and-locked to be ready [(]not that there's anything wrong with this, but I wouldn't recommend if for a novice[)].

Six shots may not sound like enough but practice with a speed-loader can have you back in the game with a fresh six rounds very quickly.

That being said, S&W M64s are as rare as hen's teeth at the typical gun shop while self-feeders fill the display cases.

With that in mind, the recommendation of the FNX is a good choice: I had an FNP-9 and it was a truly good pistol with many good features.

I am a bit surprised the Beretta PX4 Storm was not on the list, but the FN is a dandy pistol.]]>

        <![CDATA[Overall this is a good article. At one of the clubs that I help teach at [(]NRA basic pistol[)] we tell the students that they should consider the following questions before buying a handgun.

• INTENDED USE OF THE PISTOL
• PRICE AND BUDGET
• AVAILABILITY AND PRICE OF AMMUNITION
• PISTOL FIT AND ERGONOMICS
• PISTOL SIZE/WEIGHT
• RECOIL
• SIMPLICITY OF OPERATION AND EASE OF CLEANING
• REPUTATION OF MANUFACTURER
• RELIABILITY RECORD OF MAKE AND MODEL
• WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE
• AVAILABILITY OF REPAIR OR AFTERMARKET PARTS

Everyone is different. Thus what is appropriate for one person may not work well for another. Be it action type and/or caliber. If one isn’t prepared to take the time to practice often, then a revolver with less buttons/levers to deal with maybe the better choice over a semi-auto handgun. Conversely a person willing to put in the time and work on marksmanship and their defensive shooting skill, should be able to handle a large caliber semi-auto along with its potential malfunctions with no problem.

BTW, I bought a FN, FNX-9 for firearms training and it’s been a valuable asset. It’s totally ambidextrous, so now even southpaws have a gun that works naturally for them.]]>

        <![CDATA[For Johnn Clark - 
A revolver is heavier? 
My Kimber CDP [(]7 rounds[)] is heavier than my wife's Ruger 357. And then you recommend a full 1911?
Capacity: Her 5 to my 7. I didn't see Fire Fight on the questions but, otherwise - big woop.
So, you have to... pull the trigger on a revolver? Have to give you that. But while the stroke is furter on her Ruger, it's no harder to pull than my Kimber.
If you like your 1911, great. You don't need bad excuses.
My wife rejected my Well Researched recommendation for her first handgun and chose the Ruger SP 101 in .357 during a recon visit to the gun store. She's carried it everywhere ever since. 
My question would be if anyone has REGRETTED a certain first handgun.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Consider a 22LR revolver or semi-auto, or a centerfire pistol with an available 22LR conversion kit. I realize that the new shooter wanted a self-defense handgun, and no way is 22LR acceptable as a self-defense cartridge. But, a new shooter needs to learn to shoot.  22LR ammo is about $7.50 per 100 and 9mm practice ammo is about $33.00 per hundred. So say learning initial marksmanship for accuracy takes at least a 1,000 rounds. So, it's $75 vs. $330. ]]></comment_content>

      <![CDATA[Over the past two decades, pellet rifles have become more accurate, durable and technologically advanced, but the recent shortage of ammo seems to have been the catalyst that stirred many shooters to begin giving these air-powered guns a harder look.



Since the 1960s, <a href="http://www.gamousa.com/" target="_blank">Gamo</a> has been producing pellet guns in Spain. The company has long been on the leading edge of design and technology in the airgun field, and today Gamo is one of the largest names in the industry, selling its products in more than 50 countries around the world.



One of the standout products in its current line is the Whisper Fusion Pro series pellet rifle, which has all of the features you expect on a Gamo rifle minus one thing-noise. While all airguns are quieter than firearms, the Whisper Fusion Pro drops the noise level even farther by adding features like the Whisper Fusion Double Integrated Noise Dampening Technology and a Fluted Polymer Jacketed Steel Barrel. This system helps reduce noise by surrounding the barrel in a double layer of polymer, effectively eliminating the vibrations and noise generated by the shot. Unlike traditional firearms, which create noise through the burning of smokeless powder, airguns are naturally quiet except for the vibration caused by the firing spring, and even though there is no muzzle blast these vibrations can still create considerable noise that could potentially scare off varmints. Gamo’s exclusive barrel, with its multiple layers of sound-deadening technology, absorbs the shock and reduces the sound generated with each shot. A pair of Integrated Sound Moderators, as Gamo calls them, prevent sound waves from expanding by way of a rifling system that deadens vibration and noise. Sound waves are captured and absorbed, preventing excess noise from escaping the barrel during the shot. Whether you are a serious varmint and small-game hunter who doesn’t want to scare off game or simply a target shooter who doesn’t want to disturb the neighbors, this system is highly effective in reducing the rattle and vibration caused by shooting the gun.



Besides being quiet, the Whisper Fusion pro has many of the other features that consumers have come to expect from Gamo rifles. This break-action rifle has a 33 mm cylinder that is re-cocked with 41 pounds of force. The barrel is fully rifled, and the metal work is tight-fitting and well-constructed so that this gun will last for thousands of shots. The large sound-dampening barrel also acts as a solid platform for cocking and offers a sure grip for quick reloads. Since Gamo manufactures all of its components in-house, quality control is very high, and this attention to detail comes through every time you cock and fire the rifle. With PBA pellets the maximum muzzle velocity is an impressive 1,400 fps, making this a dedicated varmint rifle that is capable of taking squirrels, woodchucks and other game at moderate ranges.



The Whisper Fusion Pro utilizes Gamo’s Smooth Action Trigger (SAT), which is a two-stage model that breaks at a factory pre-set 3.74 pounds. Gamo understands that a precision air rifle requires a smooth, consistent trigger for optimum accuracy, and this gun has a crisp trigger pull with very low creep. The manual safety is located just in front of the trigger, and if you’ve never used a Gamo rifle it may seem like an odd placement. However, after a while it becomes second-nature and allows the shooter to turn the safety to the “off” position without losing sight picture. In addition, it is one of the quietest systems on the market.



The stock of the Whisper Fusion Pro is made of black, molded synthetic material that is impervious to weather. It won’t warp, and the non-glare finish won’t spook small game when hunting. Large textured panels offer a sure grip, and a raised Monte Carlo-style cheekpiece naturally aligns the eye with the sights. The Shock Wave Absorbing recoil pad is soft and comfortable, and Gamo claims it reduces recoil by up to 74 percent. This is a great aid in learning to control trigger squeeze, and even though the shock generated by a pellet gun is low compared to rimfire and center-fire rifles, vibrations can cause a flinch, leading to problems of jerking the trigger, especially among new shooters. Gamo understands this, and the company has worked to eliminate the noise and vibration that can cause a shooter to lose focus on the target. With the SAT trigger and the SWA recoil pad, this gun greatly reduces the vibration that the shooter feels and allows for a clean, smooth trigger pull. This, in turn, leads to consistent accuracy.



The iron sights on the Whisper Fusion Pro are among the best in the industry, and the large rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. Both the front and rear sight have high-visibility fiber-optic inserts, and the front sight is hooded to reduce glare. The gun also comes with a 3-9X Gamo scope with adjustable parallax and large windage and elevation knobs that are easy to set by hand. The scope has a large duplex reticle with surprisingly good glass for a scope in this price range. This made it possible to shoot 1-inch, three-shot groups from 25 yards, and at that same distance it was possible to keep 10 shots under 2 inches shooting offhand, due to the gun’s balance and the excellent stock and trigger.



One of the best features of the Gamo air rifle is that it is entirely ambidextrous, and a left-handed shooter doesn’t have to worry about manipulating controls that were designed with right-handed shooters in mind. My wife is a new shooter and a southpaw, and the Gamo’s low noise and recoil levels made this a gun she was comfortable shooting almost immediately. In addition, shooting tight groups helped build her confidence. If you are teaching a new shooter how to handle a gun the Gamo is ideal no matter if they are left or right handed.



I received the test rifle in September, which marks the beginning of Ohio’s squirrel season. Ever since I was a kid I’ve loved hunting squirrels, but I don’t like the idea of firing a shotgun or rimfire rifle in the same woods I plan to deer hunt the following month. With the Whisper Fusion Pro I felt better about hunting in my favorite spot, and on the first morning I took the pellet rifle to the woods I saw a half-dozen squirrels working on hickory nuts within 30 minutes of sunrise. I was shooting Gamo’s new .177-caliber Quiet Pellet ammunition, and I felt confident that I could kill squirrels cleanly without the noise associated with bigger guns. I had my chance when a gray squirrel hopped up on a moss-covered stump at 15 yards. The squirrel dropped without a twitch at the shot, and I sat back against the tree watching two other squirrels pause momentarily and continue feeding.



There’s a lot to like about the Gamo Fusion Pro. It’s quiet, well-built, accurate and accommodating for both left- and right-handed shooters. Whether you’re buying a pellet rifle for hunting, plinking or training a new shooter (or all three), the Whisper Fusion Po is worth a look. It’s cheap to shoot and very accurate.



<strong>Gamo’s Quiet Pellet</strong>

Gamo has long produced air rifles that were quieter than the competition, but the company now offers ammunition that further reduces the amount of noise generated with each shot. The new Quiet Pellet has a lead core, with layers of copper and black nickel along with a pointed dome and a long skirt. The outer layer of the pellet is smooth to the touch, and this exterior coating helps minimize friction and noise. To test Gamo’s claims that its new pellet is quieter than the competition, I fired both Gamo Quiet Pellets and standard .177 lead hunting pellets in the Whisper Fusion Pro rifle, and the Quiet Pellets created virtually no noise while the standard pellets, though aided by the sound-deadening technology in the rifle, created an audible pinging noise when fired.



Gamo didn’t want the new Quiet Pellet to sacrifice accuracy for silence, and the long skirt helped in stabilization and overall accuracy was good. On the target, there were no signs of the pellets tumbling or turning in flight, and the performance on game was excellent. Gamo sells the Quiet Pellet in 150-count blister packs, and when combined with the Whisper Fusion Pro I found that these pellets generated an average muzzle velocity of about 1,240 fps over my chronograph.<strong></strong>

        <![CDATA[My deadliest hunting weapon of all is my Beeman R9 in .177. All spring piston guns are pretty quiet or at least make a sound that game can't recognize. A pneumatic[(]pump-up[)], precharged pneumatic or CO2 gun makes a loud pop like a .22. The best db measurement is game. I've slaughtered murders[(]flocks[)] of crows with my R9 or my similar Diana at 40-50 yds. The only thing that clued them to my attack was their buddies falling from the trees for no reason. My vintage Benjamin and Sheridan send them flying with the first shot. I've had squirrels continue to move towards me, not knowing I've harvested another squirrel with my spring gun. 
A magnum springer is louder than a pumper with maybe 4 pumps, but 4 pumps is only useful for close ranges, like 20 yds. Never used a Gamo springer, but I do have a Gamo 126 single stroke pneumatic 10m rifle, so I know well of Gamo quality. The UK airgun press says Gamo tests their springers brutally to assure long life, since the mainsprings do wear out and break on all springers.]]>

      <![CDATA[Smith &amp; Wesson Holding Corporation has launched new initiatives to honor and support the community's veterans and military families and to pay tribute to Springfield's fallen heroes. Joined by Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno, the company unveiled plans to fund and oversee the repair and restoration of the historic Roosevelt Avenue Veteran's Memorial flagpole.



The repairs are set to be complete in time for a rededication ceremony on Memorial Day 2014, the anniversary of the memorial's original dedication in 1932. The cost of the restoration, paid entirely by Smith &amp; Wesson, is expected to be approximately $200,000.



"Over the course of our 162-year history in Springfield, we have maintained a special relationship with those who have served in the armed forces," said President and CEO of Smith &amp; Wesson James Debney. "They are our employees, our neighbors, our friends, and they are integral to the values and the fabric of our community and our country. While nothing we do compares with the sacrifices made by these heroes and their families, we are honored to have the opportunity to recognize them and give back in some small way."



The company will also be partnering with local not-for-profit organizations dedicated to improving the lives of veterans and their families, with more announcements to come.

      <![CDATA[Much like the .380 Mustang PocketLite design that preceded it, <a href="http://www.coltsmfg.com/" target="_blank">Colt's</a> Mustang XSP is a small, lightweight and reliable handgun-except, this time, it's sporting a polymer frame.



Such a frame, of course, is the most noticeable difference between the two models-but it's not the only one. Colt spent a significant amount of time adding a series of ergonomic touches to the firearm's frame, improving its performance in the operator's hand. The features that have made PocketLite successful are still noticeable-the High Profile Sights, Commander style hammer and .380 ACP chambering are all there.



To learn more about the Colt Mustang XSP, check out the video below, hosted by <em>American Rifleman's</em> Editor-in-Chief, <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article_list_author.php?id=16" target="_blank">Mark Keefe</a>.

      <![CDATA[A woman and her son were driving around 11:30 a.m. when a vehicle cut them off and abruptly stopped in front of them. A man exited the vehicle, pulled the woman from her car and held a knife to her throat. When the woman's son got out of the car to confront his mother's attacker, he was reportedly punched in the face. A passerby witnessed the attack and stopped to intervene with his .40-cal. handgun. When the suspect saw the firearm, he quickly returned to his vehicle and drove off. The good Samaritan who had stopped to help was able to get the suspect's license plate number, which later resulted in the attacker's arrest. He was charged with assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature and assault and third degree battery. (<a href="http://www.wistv.com/" target="_blank">WISTV.com</a>, Richland County, SC, 6/5/13)



Four intruders entered a Virginia home armed and masked, ready to rob the victims. The homeowner pulled his firearm and hit an intruder, according to police. Others grabbed a second masked man and held him. Two of the intruders escaped. The residents were unharmed. The intruder who was shot was taken to the hospital and is expected to recover with charges pending. The second suspect was charged with robbery, use of a firearm in a felony, breaking and entering, and conspiracy to commit a felony. Police continue to search for the two who escaped. (<a href="http://pilotonline.com/" target="_blank">PilotOnline.com</a>, Portsmouth, VA, 10/3/13)



<strong>From The Armed Citizen Archives</strong>

<em>September 1976:</em> A robber broke through the front door of Frank Davenport's Atlanta, Ga., home and threatened to beat him until Davenport gave him money. But Davenport reached under the bed for a .38-cal. pistol and fired twice, killing his assailant. (<em>The Atlanta Journal</em>, Atlanta, Ga.)]]>

      <![CDATA[Carry guns sit in holsters against the body and are exposed to changes in humidity and sweat. As such, everyday guns require additional care since they’re required to work when needed to potentially save a life.



Anyone who carries a concealed handgun should fire his or her gun at least once a month to maintain proper firearm and safety handling skills. Every time you head to the range for practice, you should perform a <a title="Learn how to clean your handgun. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=14032&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=0" target="_blank">breakdown cleaning of your gun</a>. Since you would never put a dirty rifle in the safe, why would you strap one to your body? This is the time for you to visually inspect all of the parts that ensure the gun is safe to shoot.



However, a carry gun should also be wiped down on a regular basis with a cloth to prevent rust from forming (daily if you work in varying conditions and temperatures). This includes putting a patch through the bore. If it has been a while since you’ve made it to the range, you should also periodically unload the gun and remove all ammunition to test the hammer and trigger to ensure that nothing has wedged into the mechanisms that would prevent the gun from firing.



A carry gun is a tool, an important tool. And considering its designated purpose, it could be your most important tool. Be sure to take care of it.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Of course cleaning is important but you need to take this discussion to the next level by addressing recoil spring and magazine spring replacement as it applies to semi-autos. And a little of your expertise regarding 'regular' vs. 'extra-strength' springs would be appreciated. The accepted rule-of-thumb answer is to replace magazine springs when they fail to feed the last rounds in the magazine, when the spring is at its weakest, but finding that out during a social engagement could be embarrassing. A little constructive advice from you on a pre-emptive replacement schedule would be helpful, especially is these days when magazines are kept fully loaded. And, of course, the practice of installing a heavier than stock recoil spring usually calls for a magazine spring with more oomph in order to deliver the next round before the slide slams shut with a now higher level of vigor. Can you expand on the subject of handgun maintenance by addressing springs in your next article?]]></comment_content>

    <title>9 mm versus .357 Sig</title>

      <![CDATA[A reader was interested in a 9 mm/.357 Sig comparison after I discussed the <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blog.php?id=15382&amp;cat=47" target="_blank">9 mm cartridge versus the newer .40 S&amp;W</a>. In the 9-to-40 comparison, we have a smaller, lighter bullet versus a slower, heavier one. The bigger, heavier bullets of the .40 S&amp;W have already established a good reputation for fight-stopping performance. But a typical pistol will hold a few less of them than a comparable-sized 9 mm auto. I think that adequate capacity of more effective 40s renders the 9 mm’s advantage in both capacity and velocity a very moot point. Still, the 9 mm has some advantages in easier shooting and training, as well as lower cost and longer gun life.



To compare the 9 mm to the .357 Sig is an entirely different ball game. First used by the German Navy in 1904, the 9 mm Luger (or Parabellum, etc.) has a long service history and is probably the most widely used pistol cartridge in the world. The little round came into its own in the 70s when modern JHP ammo was developed. Capable of good velocities, particularly with lighter bullets, the 9 mm cartridge is made for dozens of pistol designs. Although made with typical 115-grain bullets for many years, the most commonly used 9 mm Luger bullet today weighs 124 grains. Heavier 147-grain JHPs are becoming more popular.



The .357 Sig is a recent cartridge that has one characteristic exactly like the 9 mm Luger-it uses the same 124- and 147-grain bullets. Despite the name, the actual bullet diameter is 9 mm (.355 inches). It differs in that it is uses a bottlenecked case developed from the .40 S&amp;W. Among other advantages, this means the gun’s breech dimensions and magazines are the same as the .40’s. Building a gun is usually no more complicated than installing a .357 Sig barrel in a .40 S&amp;W pistol. With greater case capacity of modern powders, the .357 Sig is a very hot number. I have heard reports of accelerated gun wear.



There is an enormous array of 124-grain ammo in 9 mm, including some +P and +P+ that is extra hot. The average velocity for all loads at this weight is about 1,100 fps. Now look at the average velocity of an admittedly smaller assortment of .357 Sig ammo using bullets of the same weight. It is approximately 1,350 fps. In other words the typical 125-grain JHP load travels 250 fps faster in a 357 Sig than in a 9 mm Luger. In the 147-grain bullets, the 9 mm drives bullets to about 1,000 fps, while the .357 Sig does about 1,225, some 125 fps faster. There is a clear speed advantage to the Sig, not at all surprising in view of the larger case capacity.



When you crunch the numbers through the formula that calculates kinetic energy, the 9 mm gets approximately 336 ft.-lbs. for 125s and 326 for 147-grain slugs. The .357 Sig is way ahead at 506 ft.-lbs. for 125 grainers and 490 for the 147-grain bullets. Inescapably, the .357 Sig is a much more powerful cartridge.



That does not make it a better cartridge. It recoils strongly, has lesser capacity in same-size guns and may be hard on guns. Using it skillfully takes practice and familiarity. These are pretty subjective matters, which prompts the observation that if you can handle the .357 Sig, it is an automatic pistol cartridge that wildly out-performs the 9 mm Luger and even equals the legendary .357 Mag.-when the latter is using 125-grain bullets.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Always fun to get out the ballistic tables and compare cartridges. Bottom line is the more powerful cartridges cost more to shoot, recoil more, and improve your chances of putting the bad guy down before he kills you. But maybe the cost and recoil factors are above your comfort zone? Handloading can lower the cost of shooting and the weight/size of your weapon plus choice of grips can mitigate recoil. A lot of ink has been posted about how ammunition has improved to the point that small bullets can expand and become big bullets. What is forgotten is that when small bullets expand their enlarged frontal area reduces their sectional density and thus their penetration and penetration is the number one criteria when choosing a self-defense bullet. Back when the FBI was still using the 9mm, they were smart enough to go with the heavier 147-grain bullet, take all available penetration, and let expansion be what is was. And when that didn't work out, they switched to the 10mm/40 S&W. For those that are recoil intolerant, a suggestion: For home use a full-size, full-weight, full-power weapon to maximize your chances of winning the fight. For carry, get yourself a lightweight and small .380/9mm and hope for the best. And don't get too wrapped up in magazine capacity. If your plan is to shoot the bad guy 10 times at 7 feet with a mouse gun before he goes down, don't you think he will be shooting you 10 times too? You would be better served to use less rounds, but more powerful rounds, in order to end the fight before you get too shot up. Yes, power is good if you can handle it. If not for increased power, we would still be shooting .38s instead of .357s;  .44s instead of .44 Magnums; .45 Colts instead of .454 Casulls. And, yes, 9mms instead of .357 SIGS. ]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Zac, to answer your question its all about momentum a bullet carries with it as it builds acceleration in a barrel. A heavier bullet has more momentum that the powder charge has to overcome before peak pressure occurs. A lighter bullet has less momentum to overcome, and so it can achieve a higher muzzle velocity on exit. But without that extra momentum, it will have less penetration and expends all its energy faster, and may not even exit your opponent, which can be a good or bad thing. A heavier bullet exits the barrel a little slower because the powder charge could not quite get it there before peak pressure, but its own weight carries more momentum with it downrange, resulting in more penetration. Whether the extra momentum of a heavy bullet makes up for the lighter bullet’s velocity advantage in ultimate stopping power, is why shooters argue to no end on how a 357 Sig is better than a 9mm+P. Wiley’s point here is that the 357 Sig has more magnum stopping power to end a gunfight, but is it worth it for its effects on the gun and shooter. One solution is a compensator, which would tame slide momentum and resulting recoil. But more noise and muzzle flash to deal with are not to everyone’s liking, so even that isn’t perfect. And so most shooters have stayed with 9mm+P as the more reasonable compromise in this caliber, and the more experienced ones liking the 357 Sig. I’m glad to see both bullets are available, to better suit a shooter’s needs.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Zac: Speer gives the formula for bullet energy as VELOCITY [(]fps[)] X VELOCITY [(]fps[)] X BULLET WEIGHT [(]grains[)] all divided by 450,400. As you can see, velocity gets squared while weight doesn't. This gives velocity a huge advantage over weight when determining foot pounds of energy. The problem is that rifle cartridges are probably better suited to using foot pounds of energy than handgun cartridges because they usually have velocities of over 2000 fps where 'shocking power' comes into play. Low velocity handgun cartridges are said to be better evaluated by measuring their MOMENTUM which is simply weight times velocity, both factors carrying equal importance. Now you can see how important bullet weight becomes and of course bullet weight benefits penetration which is required for handgun bullets to be at their very best. This explains why large and heavy bullets like the .40 and .45 are always so highly regarded for self-defense. And, if you can drive them a little extra fast, you can turn a highly effective round into a 'well-trained rhinoceros,' according to Jeff Cooper. Handgun hunters also favor weight over velocity when hunting big game because they require their bullets to go deep. In choosing your self-defense cartridge a large caliber will give you large holes due to its diameter [(]even more if it expands[)] and the heavy bullet weight analogous to a big bore assures deep penetration. Now just drive it as fast as possible and you will have your own well-trained rhinoceros.  ]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Just to add, modern technology can do a lot toward resolving the shortcomings of 357 Sig's magnum effects. As far as the gun getting beat up, a good compensator resolves that nicely. And to resolve muzzle flash, just mount a flashlight / laser so you won't have to aim line of sight, and night blindness won't happen. Earmuffs resolve noise on the range, and a few loud bangs once or twice in your life when its for real, are the least of your problems. Muzzle flash can also be resolved by using low flash powders, either handloaded of from factory. Ammo manufacturers are already on the ball and coming out with this, and can also do their part if they were to market a '357 Sig Lite' version, equaling or just slightly bettering a 9mm+P [(]remember Federal's 12 gauge Lite load? That was a successful idea, just do the same thing here[)]. 357 Sig's best advantage is there's room to seat a heavier bullet than in a 9mm in that gun's platform, to take advantage of its extra powder capacity. And as Bigfoot says, a heavier bullet driven slightly faster is ideal. What more can you ask in this caliber? Point is, 357 Sig is versatile and still has room to grow and mature, where 9mm+P is maxed out in development. It may yet come out on top.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[In all fairness to the 9mm round, the original [(]and still standard[)] loading for the 9mm is a 124 grain bullet at 1150fps from a 4 inch barrel. A decent +p loading will get you 400-450lbs/ft of energy compared to 500lbs/ft or so for the .357Sig. Obviously the .357Sig has more power, but suffers from less capacity and higher cost, just like the .40S&W. I guess you could say the same for the .44mag. To each his own.]]></comment_content>

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://redfield.com/" target="_blank">Redfield</a> has expanded its Battlezone riflescope line, designed for tactical AR-15 and bolt-action rifles, with a 6-18x44 mm model.



The new scope features fully multi-coated lenses, Redfield’s Bullet Drop Compensation System and a TAC-MOA reticle, along with pop-up, resettable ¼-inch m.o.a. adjustment knobs.



The Bullet Drop Compensation System comes with two adjustment dials calibrated for two of the most popular tactical rifle calibers-.223/5.56 mm NATO with 55-grain bullets traveling at 3,100 fps and.308/7.62 mm NATO firing 168-grain bullets at 2,650 fps. Each dial is marked in 50-yard increments.



The TAC-MOA reticle features stadia lines on the horizontal and vertical crosshairs set at one minute of angle (m.o.a.) increments, allowing for quick holdover for wind or elevation, and can be used for range estimation on objects of known size.



The Battlezone also comes with a fast-focus eyepiece, and 100-percent waterproof, Nitrogen-filled maintubes to prevent fogging and freezing, along with Redfield’s No Excuses lifetime warranty.]]>

      <![CDATA[The National Rifle Association has announced that tickets for the Great American Outdoor Show in Harrisburg, Pa., are now available online at <a href="http://www.greatamericanoutdoorshow.org" target="_blank">GreatAmericanOutdoorShow.org</a>. The show will take place Feb. 1-9, 2014 at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex and will feature nearly 1,100 exhibitors. The NRA has reduced ticket prices from the levels of the previous Harrisburg Sport Show.



<strong>Admission is as follows:</strong>



<em>Adult: $12</em>

<em>Child (6-12): $6</em>

<em>Senior (65 or older): $10</em>

<em>2-Day Pass: $20</em>

<em>Group Pass (10 or more people): $10</em>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I was hoping to catch a glimpse of the machine or person that does the serial number stampings on Colt's AR15s. Since the introduction of the SP1 in the early 60s until this day in 2013, Colt still has not figured out a way to stamp a serial number on straight!!!!!! Serial numbers on Colt's modern AR15 rifles serial number stampings look like a snake or a roller coaster and it's plain ridiculous! The devil is in the details and there is NO excuse for this. Hey Colt.....why don't you call your competitors, literally, any one of them.....since every one but you can stamp a serial number on a rifle in a straight line!]]></comment_content>

      <![CDATA[Oregon-based Darex, a 40-year-old family-owned maker of industrial tool sharpeners, knows a thing or two about how to put a keen edge on steel. Through its <a href="http://www.worksharptools.com" target="_blank">Work Sharp brand</a>, the company has partnered with knife designer Ken Onion to produce a powered tabletop knife and implement sharpener for outdoorsmen. The U.S.-assembled device features a variable speed 1.5–amp motor that drives flexible 3/4-inch x 12-inch abrasive belts of the same type used by professional knifemakers.



The motor’s variable control-6,112 to 14,261 r.p.m.-allows optimal belt speeds for a particular task and steel. A contoured, non-slip handle and rubberized feet allow the user to anchor the 10-inch x 6-inch x 5½-inch unit to a tabletop while drawing the knife blade past its blade guides, which are adjustable from 15 to 30 degrees. The unit can sharpen hunting and kitchen knives, including gut hooks and serrated edges, hatchets and even lawn mower blades.



The sharpener comes with a five-piece abrasive belt kit with P120 extra coarse, X65 coarse, X22 medium, X4 fine and 6000 extra fine grits along with an instructional DVD. Price: $150. Contact: Darex Corp. (Dept. AR), 210 E. Hersey St., Ashland, OR 97520; (800) 547-0222.]]>

      <![CDATA[In 1975, Ceská zbrojovka Uherský Brod (CZUB) of the Czech Republic successfully launched the original CZ-75 series of semi-auto pistols. Lauded for their reliability, high ammunition capacity and user-friendly design, the CZs have inspired a variety of clones from several different gun manufacturers. One company that has a reputation for providing top quality CZ-style pistols for an affordable price is Canik 55 of Turkey. Recently, <a href="http://www.canik55.com/index.php?lang=en" target="_blank">Canik 55</a> teamed up with <a href="http://www.tristararms.com/" target="_blank">TriStar Sporting Arms</a> to import the T-120 9 mm into the American shooting market.



The TriStar T-120 is a full-size, short-recoil operated, locked-breech, center-fire double-action/single-action 9 mm pistol. Its outward appearance is inspired by the<a href="http://www.israel-weapon.com/" target="_blank"> Israel Weapon Industries’</a> (IWI) Jericho 941 version of the CZ-75. The beveled slide is constructed of matte-black finished steel, featuring scalloped, rear slide serrations. The full-length guide rails of the slide ride inside of the frame, instead of wrapping over the frame like many other modern semi-autos. The three-dot sight system consists of a pinned blade front sight and a no-snag dovetailed windage-adjustable rear sight.



The 4.7-inch barrel features traditional six land-and-groove rifling, which is safe to use with lead bullets. A full-length, steel guide rod is supported by a single round-wire recoil spring. The frame of the T-120 is constructed of a lightweight steel alloy sporting the same matte-black finish as the slide. The unloaded pistol, with an empty magazine inserted, tips the scale at 30 ounces, making it a relatively lightweight carry option for a full-sized pistol.



The trigger guard features a flat, serrated finger rest along the front edge. The comfortably shaped grip frame provides plenty of room for a full three-finger grip, even for large hands. The grip's backstrap is smooth while the frontstrap has a series of straight-cut serrations to provide improved traction. The thin, lightly textured polymer grip panel features the TriStar logo on the left side. A beavertail grip extension protects the shooter's hand from being bitten by the exposed skeletonized hammer, and a milled-in accessory rail supports the addition of light and laser sighting modules to the frame of the gun.



The pistol's controls are located on the left side, including the slide stop, magazine release and the thumb safety. The square-shaped thumb safety can be engaged with the hammer forward for a double-action trigger pull on the first round fired, or with the hammer cocked-and-locked to start firing with a light single-action trigger pull. The steel bow trigger proved to be smooth and heavy (12 pounds) in double-action mode, and crisp and clean with 5 pounds, 8 ounces of pressure in single action. Some companies cut corners by only providing a single magazine with the gun. TriStar provides two blued steel Italian-made Mec-Gar 17-round magazines, which is a nice touch.



Field stripping the T-120 for maintenance starts by removing the magazine and verifying the pistol is completely unloaded. With the hammer in the forward position, pull the slide back until the disassembly notches located on the left side of the slide and frame are aligned. Hold the slide in this position and remove the slide stop. Pull the slide forward and off of the frame. Remove the recoil assembly from the slide and then lift out the barrel. That's as far as the pistol needs to be disassembled for routine cleaning, and it goes back together just as easily as it comes apart.



For concealed carry, the T-120’s full-size profile was a good match for testing the new <a href="http://www.blackhawk.com/" target="_blank">BLACKHAWK!</a> Diversion Carry Sling Pack. While some concealed-carry bags clearly present a military or law enforcement profile, this single-strap bag has been specifically designed to blend into the crowd with a common sports bag shape and color scheme. Its fully ambidextrous design and adjustable holster allow for quick access to a variety of defensive handguns from either the right or left side of the body without having to remove the bag. Additional pockets can be used to hold spare magazines, cell phones, keys or other small every-day items. It was comfortable to wear during outdoor activities and no one ever gave it a second look.



Having handled and tested an IWI Jericho 941 pistol in the past, I was curious to see how the less expensive Turkish T-120 would behave on the range. The pistols that fall into the $400 real-world price group can be a mixed lot. Some are great investments, while others have a rather lackluster level of performance. It was good to see that the T-120 falls into the first category with excellent fit, finish and top-notch accuracy.



The slide-to-frame fit was slick and tight. The full-length rails and clean machining made the slide smooth to cycle right out of the box. The thumb safety snapped crisply into the on and off positions and the magazine release consistently dropped the magazines free without any hang-ups or stickiness. The grip shape and low bore axis of the T-120 made for comfortable shooting with a wide variety of 9 mm rounds.



The T-120 was test fired with ammunition ranging from less-expensive practice loads to high-end +P defensive rounds. Although the pistol can be safely fired with +P rated ammunition, the manufacturer does not recommend using increased velocity loads on a regular basis. The pistol proved to be reliable with all of the ammunition tested, producing no malfunctions of any kind over the course of formal and informal testing.



Formal accuracy testing consisted of firing five, five-shot groups from a bench rest into targets set at 25 yards. The results were impressive because not a single five-shot group exceeded 3 inches in size. The best single five-shot group of 2.1 inches was produced using<a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank"> Winchester's</a> Supreme Elite PDX1 147-grain bonded jacketed hollow-point load. This ammunition also produced the best five group average of 2.32 inches, followed by the <a href="http://www.barnesbullets.com/" target="_blank">Barnes</a> TAC-XPD 115-grain +P all-copper hollow point at 2.65 inches and the <a href="http://www.hornady.com/ammunition" target="_blank">Hornady</a> Steel Match 125-grain HAP load at 2.68 inches. I have to be honest here. When I can squeeze an out-of-the-box test gun group down to around 3.5 inches in size, I know I'm doing my job correctly. When the shot groups stay at or below 3 inches, it’s definitely the gun and the ammunition doing the talking.



The full-size TriStar T-120 9 mm pistol provides shooters on a budget an excellent balance of form and function with a level of accuracy that exceeds the affordable price tag. This pistol's grip and controls should be accessible and easy to operate for most hand sizes, and the moderate level of recoil will prove to be agreeable with new and seasoned shooters alike. Reliable, lightweight and comfortable to shoot, this is a pistol that folks will be willing to practice with on a regular basis. It's nice to see that once in a while gun buyers can get more than they pay for.

        <![CDATA[Does the gun have any of the el-cheapo brittle MIM cast parts?

Is the frame made of an aluminum or steel casting or is it bar stock or is it forged?

Ditto for the slide?

What type of rifling does the gun have, hammer fudged, button, polygonal, cut?

What type of finish does it really have, polymer, phosphate, paint, Teflon?

Is the barrel made of stainless or chrome moly, or is it chrome plated?

Oh where is the professional gun writers like J.B. Wood when you need him?]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[To answer some questions, there seem to be no MIM parts in the gun, I believe the barrel is cold hammer forged which is very common in most Turkish arms makes. And the magazines are interchangeable with any CZ75 magazine. The ones that ship with the gun are mecgar CZ mags. And to belay any hesitancy about quality because its Turkish, Turkey has some of the most advanced machining equipment in the world.]]></comment_content>

I could not get a definitive answer from any source that my T120 Tristar would interchange successfully with 17 round CZ Mecgar magazine.  I was told that the magazine lock cut was slightly different that the Mecgar CZ mags, making lockup impossible without recutting/modifying the mag cut stop.

      <![CDATA[<strong>JFK, The NRA And The Second Amendment</strong>

John F. Kennedy was one of eight U.S. presidents to become a Life member of the National Rifle Association, guardian of Americans’ Second Amendment rights. In this distinction, JFK was the lone Democrat in the company of Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, all of whom became NRA Life members (although Nixon disavowed his membership in 1969 and George Bush resigned in 1995).



In his March 20, 1961, letter to NRA Executive Vice President Franklin Orth, accepting his Life membership, Kennedy wrote, “I am pleased to accept Life Membership in the National Rifle Association and extend to your organization every good wish for continued success.” He continued, “Through competitive matches and sports in coordination with the National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice, the Association fills an important role in our national defense effort, and fosters in an active and meaningful fashion the spirit of the Minutemen.”



Kennedy supported Second Amendment rights for Americans, saying in an April 1960 statement, “By calling attention to a well-regulated militia, the security of the nation, and the right of each citizen to keep and bear arms, our founding forefathers recognized the essentially civilian nature of our economy. Although it is extremely unlikely that the fears of government tyranny which gave rise to the Second Amendment will ever be a major danger to our nation, the Amendment still remains a major declaration of our basic civilian-military relationships, in which every citizen must be ready to participate in the defense of his country. For that reason, I believe the Second Amendment will always be important.”



<strong>JFK’s High Standing With Americans</strong>

Immediately after his assassination, the popularity of the late President was reflected in the unprecedented demand for the 1964 Kennedy half dollar, minted in his honor. Almost five times as many Kennedy halves were dated 1964 as the number of Ben Franklin half-dollars that were dated 1963.



John F. Kennedy stands far and away the most popular of recent former U.S. presidents. A CNN poll in January 2011 found that 85 percent of Americans approved of JFK, with only 8 percent disapproving and 7 percent with no opinion. Bill Clinton was second with a 72 percent approval rate, and Reagan was third with 68 percent approval.



Understandably, Democrats and Independents were more positive about Kennedy than were Republicans. However, even among the GOP Kennedy fared well, with 78 percent approving, 13 percent disapproving and 9 percent with no opinion.



<strong>Kennedy Was Our Last “Hard Money” President</strong>

President Kennedy was the last U.S. President who defended the traditional role of silver in U.S. coinage. His successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, sowed the seeds of future inflation with his “guns-and-butter” spending policies (paying for rising war and welfare costs at the same time). Barely 20 months after President Kennedy was killed in November 1963, silver demand rose so fast that President Johnson opted to take silver out of most U.S. coins during the early summer of 1965.



On June 23, 1965, while signing the Coinage Act of 1965, President Johnson proudly stated that he made “… the first fundamental change in our coinage in 173 years. The Coinage Act of 1965 supersedes the act of 1792-since that time our coinage of dimes, quarters, half dollars and dollars have contained 90 percent silver. Today, except for the silver dollar, we are establishing a new coinage-the new dimes and quarters will contain no silver. They will be composites, with faces of the same alloy used in our 5-cent piece that is bonded to a core of pure copper.”



Despite saying that “Silver consumption is now more than double new silver production each year,” he defied all laws of economic supply and demand by adding, “Our present silver coins won’t disappear and they won’t even become rarities … If anybody has any idea of hoarding our silver coins, let me say this. Treasury has a lot of silver on hand, and it can be, and it will be used to keep the price of silver in line with its value in our present silver coin. There will be no profit in holding them out of circulation for the value of their silver content.”



President Johnson was very, very wrong. Today, the price of pre-1965 “junk” circulating silver coins is about 18 times their face value. A 1964 dime trades for about $1.80, while most U.S. dimes minted after 1965 are worth … just 10 cents.

      <![CDATA[You know you’ve always wanted to visit <a href="http://www.gunsite.com" target="_blank">Gunsite Academy</a>, near Prescott, Ariz. Here’s your <a href="http://www.opticsplanet.com/lasers-edge-sweepstakes.html" target="_blank">chance</a> to win a five-day trip for two, where the instructors will put you through the paces in scenarios very similar to those seen in Crimson Trace’s The Laser’s Edge training DVD. By the way, you can join the more than half million people who have seen the DVD by ordering a free copy from <a href="http://www.crimsontrace.com/" target="_blank">Crimson Trace</a>.



The trip includes roundtrip airfare from anywhere in the continental United States, rental car allowance, hotel accommodations and instruction for two from some of the best in the business. You’ll come home with plenty of gear, too.



Registration is open until Dec. 1 and there is no cost to <a href="http://www.opticsplanet.com/lasers-edge-sweepstakes.html" target="_blank">enter</a>. The trip takes place in 2014, and the cost of ammo is also covered.



If you’re not familiar with Crimson Trace products, it’s time to crawl out from under that rock. No, I have no intention of ditching my sights, nor should you, but take a look at some of the products and I think you’ll be impressed. They include <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13408&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=26" target="_blank">green</a> laser sights, the relatively new <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13479&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=26" target="_blank">Lightguard</a> series and, of course, the classic <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13479&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=26" target="_blank">Lasergrips</a>. And I shouldn’t leave out the company’s <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13532&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=26" target="_blank">Batteries for Life</a> program. Visit the company website and there’s something for everyone.



You may want to take your significant other if you win the trip to Prescott. Why? Because any home invaders stupid enough to target your place are in for a big surprise after you both finish the <a href="http://www.gunsite.com/main/course-offerings/pistol/250-defensive-pistol/" target="_blank">250 Pistol Course</a>. And there’s a whole lot to do and see in the high desert of Arizona. Don’t take my word for it, here’s a link to the Prescott Chamber of Commerce <a href="http://www.prescott.org" target="_blank">website</a>.]]>

    <title>An American Favorite: The .243 Winchester</title>

      <![CDATA[Countless young hunters shoot rifles chambered in .243 Win. to take untold numbers of deer, antelope and more than a few elk each fall, despite assertions from big-bore advocates that the .243 is marginal, at best, for smaller big-game animals. How do they do it? Perhaps it’s because the .243, which is based on the .308 Win. necked down, can be handloaded with a variety of bullets and propellants that allow practice on targets and hunting of small game during the off-season. With that preparation, youngsters are quite able to place a bullet in the correct spot come fall, which is foremost in killing game.



<strong>Best Bullets</strong>

When the .243 Win. was introduced in 1955 it was loaded with 80- and 100-grain bullets. In the years since, an abundance of bullet styles and weights have been introduced. Hornady alone sells 10 .24-cal. bullets ranging from 58 to 105 grains, and Berger markets 12 bullets ranging in weight from 60 to 115 grains.



The lightest bullets, like Nosler 55-grain Ballistic Tips and Hornady 58-grain V-Maxs, are rather recent arrivals that direct fire and brimstone on varmints at upward of 4000 f.p.s. That high velocity results in a couple inches less bullet drop at 400 yds. than 55-gr. bullets fired from a .22-250 Rem.; however, the .243 Win. requires eight to 10 grains of additional propellant compared to the .22-250 Rem. to attain that advantage. All one summer day I shot Sierra 55-grain BlitzKings from my .243 Win. Copper Model 22 at prairie dogs. The barrel became hot enough to start a grass fire, and at the end of the day I felt like I had abused the poor rifle. To make up for it I tenderly soaked and scrubbed its bore with solvent like it was a soothing liniment. The cumulative recoil was hard on me, too.



That collective recoil makes the .243 a cartridge better for a slower shooting pace. Heavier 70- to 85-grain bullets don’t shoot quite as fast or flat as the lighter ones, but they do carry more freight for marmots, fox and coyotes. A .243 rifle mounted with a medium-power scope does not need the 3300 f.p.s. or so possible with these bullet weights because a marmot peeking over a rock at much over 250 yards is difficult to see through a four-power or even a 2-7X variable scope. Nor does target practice at 100 to 200 yards. A 70-grain bullet with a muzzle velocity of 3100 f.p.s. shoots sufficiently fast and accurately with the mild recoil appreciated by skinny shoulders padded only by summer T-shirts.



When big-game season arrives after that practice a bullet must penetrate about 7 inches on a broadside shot to pierce the lungs and reach the ribs on the far side of a deer. Under full steam, handloaded 100-grain bullets optimistically reach 3000 f.p.s. from a .243. Factory-loaded .243s claim 2960 f.p.s. with that weight bullet. At that modest speed that amount of penetration is easily accomplished with 100-grain bullets of standard construction. My wife has punched quite a few .24-cal. 100-grain Sierra Pro-Hunter and Hornady InterLock bullets clear through mule deer and antelope.



At a Texas high-fenced ranch I commented to the manager about the abundance of red deer eating the protein feed intended for the whitetailed deer. He said every year he uses his .243 to trim back the red deer that easily weigh three times more than a whitetail. He shot 20 of the big deer last year using factory-loaded 100-grain bullets. “Broadside shots,” he said, “nothing to it.”



Controlled-expansion bullets remove any doubt as to whether the .243 is suitable for big game. In fact, the trend is toward lighter weights with these bullets, such as the 80-grain Barnes Tipped Triple Shock and Hornady GMX and Swift 90-grain Scirocco II that shed little weight on impact with game. They provide a tad faster velocity for a slightly flatter trajectory than heavier bullets.



<strong>Propellant Picks</strong>

The .243’s large case capacity compared to its bore diameter and long bullets for their weight dictate the use of relatively slow-burning propellants. My Cooper .243 produced rather ho-hum velocities shooting 70- to 85-grain bullets with propellants such as Accurate 4064, Benchmark, Varget and VN140. Velocities did perk up shooting comparatively slow-burning propellants such as W760 and Big Game. Nosler 70-grain Ballistic Tips reached 3450 f.p.s. with 45.0 grs. of Big Game and Hornady 75-grain V-Max bullets 3386 f.p.s. with 
45.5 grains of W760.



Heavier bullets reach their highest speeds with even slower-burning propellants. IMR 4350 is always a good choice in the .243 paired with 90- to 100-grain bullets. From a 22-inch barrel 41.0 grains of IMR 4350 propels 100-grain bullets about 2900 f.p.s., always with admirable accuracy. Velocity is consistent, too. Extreme spread of velocity was 8 f.p.s. over five shots with Hornady 95-grain SST bullets and 41.0 grains of IMR 4350. A friend calls IMR 4350 “old guy’s powder” because it has been on market for more than 70 years and performs so well in a variety of cartridges. Other propellants suitable for heavy bullets include Reloder 19 and 22, IMR 7828 Super Short Cut, N560 and even H1000. How fast these propellants push bullets depends on the bullet. Nosler 100-grain Partitions had a muzzle velocity of 2923 f.p.s. from 45.5 grains of IMR 7828 SSC fired from my Cooper .243. A half-grain less of the propellant shot Sierra 100-grain Spitzer Boat Tails at a velocity of 2840 f.p.s. The Sierra bullets varied only 26 f.p.s. through 10 shots.<a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-18-at-9.17.39-AM.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-26154" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="Screen Shot 2013-11-18 at 9.17.39 AM" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-18-at-9.17.39-AM-300x172.png" alt="" width="300" height="172" /></a>



That’s a perfect muzzle velocity to expand the Sierra bullet, with its exposed lead tip and thin copper-alloy jacket, out to several hundred yards against the ribs tight behind a deer’s shoulder. Hunters young or old can make that killing shot if they practice first with their .243 Win.]]>

        <![CDATA[I've shot the .243 for years, and though I've not tried to take an elk with it, I believe it is able to under the right conditions. I just prefer a heavier caliber, as an elk is a very tough animal that I respect tremendously. However, with the Sierra ProHunter or the Hornady InterLock 100 grain offerings, I have taken many deer and antelope and the .243 is absolutely ferocious. IMR4350 and RL17 have shot well, but my favorite is now good old 'old man's powder' - H4831. I get tremendous performance in both accuracy and velocity with this powder. It is also outstanding with the Hornady 105 grain BTHP Match. 
I've found the Sierra 75 grain HP to be a great varmint round as well, as fueled by IMR4064. Everyone should have a .243, no matter your age!]]>

      <![CDATA[I’m actually sad having to write this blog, as this entire subject seems to show a departure from human decency. If you haven’t heard of the <a href="http://www.wjla.com/articles/2013/11/-knockout-game-targets-another-victim-in-d-c--96981.html" target="_blank">Knockout Game</a>, also called One-Hitter Quitter, then you need to pay attention, and not just to this writer.



It seems as if small groups of America’s youth, primarily in large urban areas, have decided that its funny to try and “knock out” random people on the street with a single blow. If you don’t believe me, type it into a search engine or video-sharing site, but be prepared to be disgusted on a level that I can’t even describe. There are numerous videos of people from all manners of life being attacked, usually from behind or the side, while simply walking down the street, even in daylight hours.



The attacks come with no warning and are completely random, and in at least one instance, resulted in death. In New Jersey, there is<a href="http://newsone.com/2767634/knockout-game-new-jersey/" target="_blank"> video of one Ralph Santiago</a> being followed by some teenagers into an alley when one of them strikes him in the head. He’s later found with his head lodged between some fence posts with a broken neck.



I’ve been watching posted videos of these attacks to determine what similarities can be learned, and I have noticed a few things. First, all of the attacks have happened in large, metropolitan areas. Second, the attacks typically originate from a single individual from within a group. Third, it’s almost always against a person walking alone in a semi-deserted area. And finally, it’s usually from behind.



So how do we prevent ourselves from becoming victims of these “yellow-bellied curs,” as my grandfather would have called them? In general, be aware. Know who is around you, and if someone seems suspicious, particularly a teenager, watch him and be prepared to defend yourself.



Specifically, stay out of urban areas if possible to start. Activities such as these usually run their course in a few months, after police make some arrests. If you must go into these areas, then you should travel in groups as much as possible and pay particular attention to teenagers in bunches. In no circumstances should you allow a group of teenagers to get behind you in close proximity, nor should you pass between some. If you must, walk across the street.



If you do pass some youths walking the opposite direction, watch them and turn to keep an eye on them until they are at least 20 to 30 feet away, preferable more. At that distance, you should have time to hear running footsteps and be able to turn toward the attack. If a group does manage to get behind you, walk into a store to allow them to go on, or even put your back against the wall and just watch them pass. While that might not seem nice or polite, this is not a game, and I don’t see any other way to defend against something this despicable. <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blog.php?id=15777&amp;cat=48" target="_blank">Avoidance</a> is best, defense if you must. Let’s hope this trend ends quickly.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[While I applaud the two responses about arming and shooting and it's something I feel is appropriate, just remember, folks, if it is a crowd that is attacking you and you are alone it is going to be however many there are of them against a single witness, if you survive. All you have to do is look at the Martin case to see what prosecutors will do in a shooting incident, especially when however many of them testify that all they did was start to walk by you when all of a sudden you started shooting. They didn't do a thing. You are some gun-toting crazy who just started shooting for no reason at all. Keep that in mind before you whip out your gun and start wasting 'good little boys who were just on their way home from the 7-11 after buying popsicles and popcorn and who had never been in trouble before in their life.']]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[its truly sad that WE are not allowed to arm ourselves or at least defend ourselves and loved ones from attack.  We all know that thugs lie [(]right up to the white house[)] simply to 'defend' themselves.  We shouldn't get paranoid over a group of youngsters walking toward us, just look at them to let them know we are aware of their being.  Don't become overbearing with looking at them, just make eye contact momentarily.  ALWAYS look for a way out, even if a male has to go into a beauty or manicure shop and likewise for the ladies, head for a barbershop.  However, WE do have the right to defend our loved ones and ourselves - I don't care what legislators are pushing because they have more paid gun protection around them than we can imagine.  GOD bless and stay safe.]]></comment_content>

      <![CDATA[The Model 1911 pistol is an American icon, having earned its reputation in multiple wars and more than a century of both civilian and military use. <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester Ammunition</a> has now released an ammunition line specifically designed to accompany the M1911-the Win1911



“The M1911 pistol is one of the most recognizable and iconic firearms on the market,” said Brett Flaugher, Winchester Ammunition vice president of sales, marketing and strategy. “We at Winchester have undertaken significant testing to maximize functioning and accuracy with these new offerings to create an ammunition line that lives up to the name of the legendary pistol.”



The .45 ACP rounds will be available with either a flat-nose full-metal-jacket (FMJ) or jacketed hollow-point (JHP) design. The flat-nose FMJ rounds are built for accuracy and precision. The JHP rounds are designed to shoot to the same point of impact as their FMJ counterparts, with ballistics matched in velocity and trajectory.



Both the FMJ and JHP designs feature nickel-plated bullet jackets for easy identification and 230-grain bullets traveling at 880 fps, providing similarity in loads for both practice and personal defense.]]>

    <title>Tyler Grip Adapter</title>

      <![CDATA[For many years, one of the staples of the handgunning scene was the Tyler “T” Grip adapter. Actually, it was what you would have to call the “revolver-ing” scene, because these little devices were made for a variety of different wheelguns. There was no comparable need for a like product on automatic pistols, but it served a considerable need on the revolver. Along with a similar product from Pachmayr, the grip adapter increased the contact surface on the gun when properly installed. Essentially, it is a crescent of cast aluminum that installs between the butt and trigger guard. Held in place by a light clip that is covered when the grip panels are secured in place, the Tyler unit considerably improved the handling of the gun, even working a useful finger groove shape into the design. The Tyler firm that made these devices was in business for many years, but slowed down a bit with the declining popularity of the revolver. After a time the grip adapter-properly called a “T-Grip”-became hard to find.



With a growing interest in the snubby revolver as a defensive handgun, demand for them has re-surfaced. It is a pleasure to report that the company’s <a href="http://www.t-grips.com/" target="_blank">website</a> has been updated and now offers the original Tyler T-grips (and the company’s trigger shoes) in the original sizes. They’re now offered in polished aluminum, flat-black aluminum and polished-black aluminum. Additionally, there is a new bronze T-grip and it really looks cool. I have made an order and am looking forward to getting a speedy delivery.



It is good to see a resurgence of interest in such a simple and effective product from the golden age of the revolver. For a great many handgunners of days gone by, the Tyler product was the only modification/addition they ever needed. Often, you still see it on used wheelguns at a good gun show.]]>

      <![CDATA[Michael Votruba had just arrived home from a long day at work when he spotted an animal scurrying across the yard as he exited his vehicle. Votruba was clearly able to identify the animal as a bobcat when it approached him growling. He drew the pistol he was carrying and took a few steps back. The bobcat lunged at him, attacking his leg. Votruba shook free and ran only a few steps before the bobcat jumped on his chest. Again, Votruba fought back throwing the cat to the ground and shooting twice. When the bobcat lunged at his chest yet again, Votruba fired several more shots, killing the animal. Votruba was not seriously injured during the attack, and immediately received the necessary rabies shots and an updated tetanus shot. (<a href="http://www.telegram.com/" target="_blank"><em>Telegram &amp; Gazzette</em></a>, Holden, MA, 6/20/13)



A Mississippi man was awoken by the sounds of his small dog alerting him to the presence of an intruder on the back porch. The homeowner grabbed his shotgun and stepped from his bedroom into the kitchen, according to the Lawrence County Sheriff. The intruder entered the back door only to meet a fatal shotgun blast that sent him back outside, still clutching his burglary tools. A pickup truck fled the scene, and deputies are seeking information that will lead to an arrest of the accomplice.

<strong>From The Armed Citizen Archives</strong>

<em>December 1967:</em> Alone in her Phoenix, Ariz. home, Ethel Juniel heard someone trying to break in. On his second attempt, the intruder smashed a rear windows with a bumper jack. When he reached in to undo a door latch, Miss Juniel shot him dead with a .22 pistol. (<em>Arizona Republic</em>)]]>

      <![CDATA[With decorations hanging and music in the air, the holiday shopping season is getting underway. In fact, quite a few stores are starting Black Friday specials on Thanksgiving night.



While this isn’t a concern for me, I’ll be watching the Egg Bowl on ESPN, many people will flock to the stores to find deals on gifts for loved ones. Unfortunately, this could also means that people with bad intentions could also head out to take advantage of unwary shoppers.



The National Crime Prevention Council has some tips for <a href="http://www.ncpc.org/topics/by-audience/parents/safe-shopping" target="_blank">safe shopping</a>, which should be reviewed before facing the crowds that can become overwhelming. Other tips include ensuring your purse is securely closed or moving your wallet to your front pocket to discourage pickpockets, never counting money in public or continuously touching the pocket where you store valuables.



Since a lot of problems happen in parking lots, you should also park under or near a functioning lamp in the lot, shop in groups and pay attention to your surroundings when walking out, and if you feel uncomfortable about a situation, go back inside the store and ask a security guard or employee to accompany you to your vehicle.



Most of the folks in the stores are good, decent people trying to catch a deal and enjoy the season, but there are some elements that are up to no good. Limit their opportunities by being cautious.]]>

Ensure that the all components are exact, and with regard to the shot, make sure it's evenly spread [(]i.e. no high points[)]. Using 11/16 oz. of No 5 shot, as opposed to lesser amounts or other, smaller shot sizes, certainly adds an element of difficultly.

    <title>Ruger SR-762 Rifle</title>

      <![CDATA[A few years ago, <a href="http://www.ruger.com/index.html" target="_blank">Ruger</a> decided it was time to step into the ever-growing AR-style rifle market with a new semi-auto chambered for 5.56 NATO/.223 Rem. Instead of producing another gas-impingement platform, the company invested time and resources to produce its own answer to the AR shooting system. The SR-556 rifle operates using a patented chrome-plated, two-stage piston with a multi-stage regulator. The standard AR gas-impingement system channels the hot gases produced by a fired cartridge into the bolt assembly to cycle the bolt and chamber a fresh round. It’s a proven system, but not necessarily a very clean one. Funneling exhaust gases into the action of the rifle causes it to become hot and dirty, possibly affecting how many rounds can be fired before reliability becomes an issue.



Ruger's AR design employs a piston system to cycle the action, not unlike that of the famous FN-FAL battle rifle. The hot gases from the barrel engage a piston set in an adjustable gas block. The piston actuates a spring-loaded rod, located over the barrel, which in turn cycles the bolt assembly. This system has two primary advantages. First, the bolt assembly stays cleaner and cooler during an extended course of fire. Second, the gas pressure used to cycle the bolt can be adjusted to reduce wear and tear on the rifle. It’s a flexible system that will run reliably under a variety of shooting conditions.



As well-received as the SR-556 has been, there are those among Ruger's customers who have been eager to see this successful platform re-designed to fire 7.62 NATO/.308 Win. cartridges. Their requests have been answered in the new SR-762 semi-auto rifle.



Although the SR-762 has been beefed up to handle the larger .308 cartridges, it is only 0.66-pounds heavier than the standard .223 version. Steel components are treated with a non-reflective, black manganese-phosphate finish, with aluminum components finished in a matte, hard-coat anodizing to match. The 16.12-inch cold-hammer-forged barrel is constructed of mil-spec 41V45 chrome-moly vanadium steel. It has a chrome-lined bore for added longevity and a fluted exterior to reduce the barrel's weight and improve cooling. The muzzle is cut with 5/8-inch 24 threads so that suppressors and barrel accessories can be attached, and it arrives with an SR-556-style flash suppressor already in place.



The lightweight aluminum handguard is topped with a 1913 Picatinny rail that aligns with the flat-top receiver to create a full-length optics and sight rail. A set of folding steel AR-style iron sights are provided. Like other AR combat sights, the front sight is elevation adjustable, while the rear is windage adjustable with both a large and small aperture. The three flat surfaces of the handguard (at the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions) have been drilled and tapped with five mounting points each, which can be used to attach accessory or hand guard rails.



The chromed bolt rides in a chrome-plated, one-piece bolt carrier with an oversized and radiused rear bearing surface. All of the SR-762's exterior controls are of a standard, AR-15 configuration. The charging handle, forward assist, dust cover, bolt release, magazine release and trigger can be readily identified and operated in a familiar fashion for those who are experienced with the platform. A comfortable, pebbled rubber <a href="http://www.hogueinc.com/" target="_blank">Hogue</a> Monogrip has been installed in place of the more common hard plastic pistol grip. The six-position M4-style adjustable butt stock rides on a mil-spec buffer tube instead of a commercial model. And just in case you were looking for it, Ruger found an unobtrusive place to engrave its well-known "Read the Manual" statement on this rifle. It's located on the underside of the barrel, between the flash hider and the handguard.



The knurled adjustment knob for the chromed two-stage gas piston, located at the muzzle end of the handguard above the barrel, has four settings ranging from 0 to 3. The 0 position closes the gas system completely and prevents spent cases from ejecting until the charging handle is cycled. Position 1 provides the lowest level of gas flow to cycle the action, with the 3 position providing the strongest level of bolt-cycling pressure. By adapting the gas settings to match the ammunition being used, the user can reduce unnecessary wear and tear on the rifle when using powerful loads, or keep the rifle running reliably when it becomes dirty or when weaker loads are fired. The rifle arrived set at position 2, which will run a wide variety of loads.



The rifle is rounded out with a thoughtfully assembled set of useful accessories. The gun arrives with a soft carry case with straps to hold the rifle in place and pockets for the magazines. Three 20-round <a href="http://magpul.com/" target="_blank">Magpul</a> PMAG polymer magazines are included instead of just one or two. Two short Picatinny accessory rails for use with lights, lasers and vertical grips are provided along with three polymer handguard rails for those who want to enhance the gripping surface of the fore-end. With the iron sights installed and a lock to secure the action, this gun arrives ready to go to work.



The overall craftsmanship and finish of the rifle were excellent, and the accessories were top-notch as well. The weight and balance of the rifle made it quite handy and the controls operated smoothly. The level of felt recoil was perfectly manageable with all of the ammunition fired.



For range work, two more items were added to the test set. One was the <a href="http://www.butler-creek.com/" target="_blank">Butler Creek LULA Loader</a>. The lever-operated, slip-on loader makes filling .308 magazines a painless experience. The other item was a <a href="http://www.nikonsportoptics.com/index.page" target="_blank">Nikon</a> M-308 BDC 800 4-16x42 rifle scope, which arrives with a one-piece mount that has a built-in 20 minute-of-angle (m.o.a.) slope. This scope was designed to help stretch the long-range accuracy of modern sporting rifles chambered in heavier calibers. The M-308 is nitrogen filled and o-ring sealed, featuring fully multi-coated optics, a one-piece main body tube for optimal weight reduction and durability, and tactical-style adjustment turrets with a zero-reset function. With up to 16x magnification, this is more scope than most would need for tactical applications, but with the bright, crisp, sight picture it was very comfortable to work with for accuracy testing, and is ideal for anyone looking to take far-off shots.



The gas-piston system ran reliably with all of the ammunition fired, which consisted of several commercially produced .308 Win. hunting and target shooting loads. For formal accuracy testing, five, five-shot groups were fired from a benchrest into targets set at 100 yards. Two loads were neck-in-neck for the best single five-shot group. The <a href="http://www.hornady.com/" target="_blank">Hornady</a> 168-grain Boat Tail Hollow Point (BTHP) just barely took the lead at 0.99 inches, followed by the <a href="http://hprammo.com/" target="_blank">HPR</a> 168-grain BTHP at 1 inch. Despite the relatively stiff 8-pound, 6-ounce trigger pull, the five-group averages were satisfyingly tight. The Hornady load averaged 1.17 inches, followed by HPR at 1.22 inches. <a href="http://www.federalpremium.com/" target="_blank">Federal Premium's</a> Sierra Match King 168-grain BTHP produced a 1.26-inch average and <a href="http://www.doubletapammo.net/" target="_blank">DoubleTap's</a> Long Range 155-grain BTHP Match averaged 1.36 inches. Not bad at all, but with a lighter trigger it might be possible to squeeze the groups down even more.



I found several good reasons to like the new Ruger SR-762 rifle from a technical perspective. It's well-made, reliable, comfortable to operate and it has accuracy potential to spare for a combat-style rifle. With the simple, rugged, reliable gas-piston system, it will run reliably with a wide variety of ammunition.



But one of the things I like best about this particular setup is how it demonstrates Ruger's respect for its customers. They recognize that slapping down two grand for a rifle is no small investment.  And that running around spending even more money trying to find accessories that fit is no picnic. Instead of trying to press as much profit as possible out of the platform by shipping it as a bare bones, just-one-magazine, no sights, no-frills shooting package, the gun arrives with a quality accessory set that makes it ready for the shooting range right out of the box. Just add ammo and enjoy the comfortable shooting characteristics and accuracy this rifle provides.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I just received two of these rifles and am very pleased that it is compatible with both the .308 and the 7.62 chamber pressures.  I also plan using the Nikon M-308 scope on it.  Put the M-223 scope on the SR-556 and it is an excellent combination.  Ruger really came through with the piston rifles - much better than the early M-16s we used in the mid-60s.  ]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I NEVER could understand why they chambered a .223 [(]5.56[)] in the original M-16. I had NO knock down and the range sucked. Granted the recoil was light but so was the impact while our troops,,myself included, face the 308 [(]7.62[)] AK-47 from which there was NO hiding. But then again, it was selected by people who would NOT have to use it in battle to defend themselves either...Typical Gov't buy.

        <![CDATA[I bought the SR-762 and it has its flaws. Overall, its still a keeper:

Problems:
Problem 1: 2 of the 3 supplied P-Mags had many FTE and FTFs. I called Ruger and was told I'm not the only one with this problem. Ruger has started a national mag exchange program for the 762. I sent my 2 bad mags in [(]11/25[)] and am still waiting to get 2 good mags back. The third mag runs flawlessly [(]or at least it has for 225 rounds so far[)].
Problem 2: The stock trigger was less than satisfactory. I dropped in a giesselle [(]sp?[)] and that solved the problem.
Problem 3: The peep aperture on the rear sight interferes with my optic. Normally I'd blame myself for not getting higher mounts [(]I got the Bobro[)], but the Samson peep aperture won't fold flat. The body of the folded BUIS fits under my Weaver Tactical FFP 3x15x50 just fine, but the stupid dual peep aperture doesn't fold down. Grumble grumble... If anyone wants to trade rear BUISs, let me know. Its a shame because I really like the Samson sights. BTW, the Bobro quick release mount has put my scope back to absolute zero about 5 times now.
Problem 4: Ruger will not sell spare parts for it. I asked and was told no on any “factory fitted” part, which is most of them.
Problem 5: it eats ammo WAY too fast. I blame the gun :-[)]

Enough gripes, here's what I like:
1. Its lighter than the other semi-auto 308's I played with. Are there lighter SA 308's out there? Probably, but not that readily come to mind or that I held.
2. I get submoa 5 shot groups with handloads. The first shot is a flier even when I slingshot it into the action, but the following 19 make tight little groups when I do my part.
3. The action stays very clean. I ran some Herter's steel cased ammo and didn't find any of those little yellow specs or much carbon fouling in the chamber. The gas piston gets dirty, but its easy to remove and easy to clean because its chrome plated. The Ruger's barrel cleans faster than my Remington 700 308 AAC-SD because the former is chromed.
4. I like the ability to control the gas [(]yeah yeah, insert your favorite fart joke here[)]. This gives me the option to run it reliably with a can, run it reliably without cleaning for extended periods of time, or turn the gas off and run it like a single-shot if I don't want to chase my brass at the range or buy a brass catcher.
5. The AR platform makes it comfortable to shoot, easy to put on optics, and very customizable; ie I could drop in the trigger I really wanted.
6. I don't have to baby it when handling or shooting. The flash hider protects the crown so I can ride with it “muzzle on floor” in the pickup. Its first outing was in a hellacious snow storm in the top of the Utah mountains. The gun got sopping wet and heavily snowed on yet ran fine; I should have taken a video. Sub 0 temps didn't seem to affect it on another outing; when the good mag was in. The dust cover should keep most mud, dirt, and river water out of the action when I strap it on the ATV this summer and fall. Don't get me wrong, the rifle gets cleaned and dried, and lightly lubed, but its going to have to earn its keep in a mountainous and desert area. It is not a safe queen.
7. It doesn't have much recoil; I'd guess it has about 11 ft-lbs [(]just a guess[)].
8. $1,640 otd is a lot of money for me, however, the Ruger cost less than the Sig 716 and is [(]in my book[)] equally good and weighs less.
9. It feels good to buy an American designed and produced fighting rifle when the product fits my application, is well made [(]thanks Matrix Aero[)], and the value is there.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I have had an SR 762 for about a month, with about 100 rounds fired.  Fit and finish are outstanding. The trigger is smooth, but requires substantial effort.  A lighter one would be nice. The recoil is less than I expected from a .308.  The gun can do 1' to sub-1' groups at 100 yards, but the trigger makes it a challenge.  This gun seems to like the 168 grain match grade ammo better than the lighter, cheaper stuff. The only issue I have had is that the supplied lock with a U-shaped metal clamp would not fit into the ejector port and mag well, as the lower lip on the mag well is in the way.  Ruger was surprised as they had not heard that previously & they are sending another lock.  I must say, the Ruger folks are a pleasure to deal with!]]></comment_content>

    <title>Ruger Revisits The Forty-Five</title>

      <![CDATA[It may be a paradox of sorts, but the popularity of certain cartridges for police, military and civilian defensive uses remains strongest with cartridge designs that are a century old. The ammunition companies will tell you that they sell more 9 mm Luger than anything else. Also, the demand for .45 ACP ammunition remains very strong. If there is a demand, there will be a supply, and that is true as much for guns as it is for ammunition. <a href="http://ruger.com" target="_blank">Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co.</a> has made .45 ACP pistols since the late 1980s, but the company didn’t enter the M1911 .45 market until a couple of years ago. Its basic pistol was the SR1911, a gun warmly received by the shooting public. This year, it introduced two new .45s, one of which is a short-slide M1911 variant called the SR1911CMD. I’ll address that model in an adjacent sidebar, and here examine in detail a radically new .45 called the SR45. It’s a 30-oz., 10-round-capacity, double-action-only (DAO) pistol that measures 8.0 inches by 5.75 inches by 1.27 inches.



No doubt about it, the SR45 is a service-size handgun, intended for carry in a proper holster. A fully modern gun, it has a polymer receiver topped with a steel slide, and it is of locked-breech, recoil operation. In this system, the barrel is locked to the slide when the pistol fires and remains so for a short amount of recoil travel. Internal cams drop the rear end of the barrel to unlock from the slide. It is by far the most popular system used in modern pistols. The trigger system is also commonly used these days. It is a double-action-only, wherein the internal striker is partially cocked when the slide is cycled. Trigger pressure completes cocking, then releases the striker to fire. The essence of using the SR45 trigger system well is mastering the trigger reset. A skilled shooter only allows the trigger to move forward to the point where the trigger resets.



Ruger has gone to considerable effort to make the SR45 an easy pistol to handle and shoot. It is essentially ambidextrous. With a thumb safety and magazine catch on each side of the frame, the major tactical controls are available for either right or left-handed shooting. Also, the three-dot sights are adjustable for elevation and windage. For those shooters who want a light or laser on their pistols, the SR45 has a rail built into the dust cover, but so unobtrusively that you hardly notice it until you need it. There’s a loaded-chamber indicator built into the top of the slide. You can see it under most light conditions and feel it without any light at all. All things considered, the SR45 is a handy semi-automatic pistol to use. It is in another area of its design that it really shines-ergonomics.



Ergonomics is the science of making a tool efficient in the hand of the user. In the case of a semi-automatic pistol-which is a tool-good ergonomics make the trigger action easy and the recoil controllable. Both are critically important in the case of a .45 ACP pistol and absolutely crucial when the gun has lightweight polymer construction to make it easy to carry. The SR45 is a somewhat scaled-up version of the earlier SR9 and SR40. Both of those pistols were heralded as ergonomic successes, so the slightly larger .45 version starts ahead of the game.



First, looking at a profile shot of the SR45, note that the high pocket for the web of the hand is positioned very close to the slide and above the mid-point of the trigger. Since the trigger is pivoted from the top of the trigger guard, this demands a back-and-up movement of the trigger. The gun is almost perfectly shaped for proper trigger action. Further note that the hand is close to the slide and barrel. In pistol design, it is very desirable to have a high grip in order to keep the pistol from pivoting muzzle up when fired. I cannot think of another series of guns that are so well-shaped as these.<a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/W8933_TAR_4743.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-26281" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="SR45" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/W8933_TAR_4743-300x292.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="292" /></a>



Ruger also fitted the SR45 with a reversible backstrap insert, that is flat on one side and slightly arched on the other. With the arched insert in place, the SR45 feels very good in my medium to large hands. It also points pretty well for a big pistol. When you consider that a double-column magazine is inside that grip frame, it is amazing that the gun has such a good feel, heft and balance. I spent some time examining the SR45 before I went to the range with it. All the hefting and pointing brought up memories of another gun that is widely regarded as being very good in the ergonomics sense. That is the old Remington Model 51, an early pocket semi-automatic. It is much smaller and lighter than this new Ruger pistol, but the feel is much the same.



Shooting the new Ruger gave me more of an idea about how well the gun is likely to be received. Consider that about two-thirds of the pistol’s weight is in the recoiling parts-the barrel and slide. Recoil of some of the +P loads is enough to noticeably move the gun in your hand. You need to shoot with an aggressive grip. That is a little easier because of the slightly dished-out front edges of the grip section, but it remains a problem for shooters with smaller hands and shorter fingers. Ruger also needs to look at the rear sight. It is adjustable for both windage and elevation, which means there is a movable element inside an outer case. On the sample gun, you could see daylight on one side of the movable portion which contains the rear sight notch. I found it to be distraction. Accuracy is as reported in the adjacent table. It is on a par with other service type semi-automatics and good enough for the work the gun is designed to do. As noted, the recoil is very strong and may be a problem for some shooters. There were no malfunctions, even with magazines loaded with several different cartridges of varied bullet weight and design.<a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/45.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-26277" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="45" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/45.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="197" /></a>



Consider what you get in this new model from Ruger: It is a .45 ACP with 10-round capacity. It would ride well in a policeman’s duty holster, but would also be well-suited for a home-defense handgun. Shooters have wanted a high-capacity semi-automatic in .45 for decades, but nearly every attempt to provide one resulted in a rather clunky pistol too big for many in the handgunning population. The superb ergonomics of the Ruger SR45 fill the demand of shooters who want such a pistol. It is a gun that is here to stay. And yes, a compact version of the gun is “in the works.”

<a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/W8933_TAR_4727.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-26282" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="SR1911" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/W8933_TAR_4727-300x268.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="268" /></a>It’s an accepted truth that a well-made version of the classic M1911 pistol is a viable product in today’s American handgun marketplace. Certainly Ruger’s management was aware of that when it developed and introduced the SR1911 pistol in .45 ACP. It is also true that the most popular variation of the full-size, 5-inch barreled service pistol is one with a slide shortened by almost an inch. The original maker was Colt, and the company introduced it some six decades past, calling the gun the Commander. Ruger has chosen to introduce a similar pistol and calls it the SR1911CMD. For ease of description, we’ll shorten that to CMD.



The gun is an all-stainless steel M1911 pistol with typical single-action trigger, external hammer and single-column magazine. As a matter of fact, the CMD is essentially the same gun as the original SR1911, with the exception of a barrel and slide that are shorter by 3/4 inches. That shortens the sight radius and lowers velocity a slight amount but is more than made up for with better handling and concealability. The shorter gun simply handles better. Since the CMD is all-steel, it is heavier than other aluminum-frame M1911 variants. Most M1911 shooters like the all-steel gun better when actually shooting. It is within Ruger’s manufacturing capability to produce a lightweight model, but I have no knowledge of whether or not the firm will do this.



Ruger’s CMD measures 7.79 inches by 5.45 inches by 1.34 inches. It weighs 36 ounces. The pistol is made of Ruger’s stainless steel and is finished in a dull silver color that seems very businesslike. Interestingly, Ruger chose to finish some parts of the pistol in a dull black. They are the mainspring housing, grip safety, safety lock, slide lock, magazine catch and the pins that position critical action parts. The silver-to-black contrast is attractive. I also note that the thumb safety is extended slightly and the beavertail grip safety has been slimmed down. One of my pet peeves is a slide lock with a squared front edge, because such corners tend to eat holsters alive. This one has been evenly beveled. There are a couple of attractive features on the CMD, and the first to mention is the stocks. They are made of a wood laminate checkered in the so-called “double-diamond” pattern. They’re topped off with embedded Ruger medallions-nice touch. Further, Ruger used its licensed version of the Novak sight system with three-dot sights.<a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/452.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-26278" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="452" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/452.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="196" /></a>



At the range, I found the CMD to be an easy shooting M1911, even when fired with several kinds of +P ammunition. I used a variety of different loads left over from earlier range sessions for informal shooting, before getting into the standard American Rifleman protocol. One thing is certain; the CMD digested everything I used in it without a bobble or misfire. Where accuracy is concerned, the gun performed as tabulated below. While not as accurate as other models, the pistol is entirely adequate for defensive shooting. All things considered, Ruger’s new SR1911CMD shows great promise as a serious defensive handgun.

      <![CDATA[Weaver has introduced two new optics suited for turkey hunting. One features a specially designed reticle, while the other is a versatile option for a variety of firearms.



Weaver’s new KASPA 1-4x24mm Turkey Scope comes with the Vertical Zone Turkey (VZT) Reticle. The VZT reticle’s straight-sided, slot shape is designed to naturally aim the center crosshair to the middle of a turkey’s kill zone. The two oval slots are designed to provide references for 20 and 40 yards.



At close range, the top of the turkey’s head and base of its neck fits inside the larger outer slot. At longer distances, the top of the turkey’s head and base of its neck fits inside the smaller, inner slot. In either case, the center crosshair will sit on the center of the neck for precise shot placement.



The robust 30mm tube contains fully multi-coated lenses for amazing clarity and light transmission in the turkey woods, and scope caps are also included.



Weaver’s other new option for turkey hunters is the Micro Dot Sight. It offers unlimited eye relief and a precise aiming point for fast-action shots turkey hunters regularly face. The red-dot sight mounts low for perfect eye alignment and features adjustable brightness settings for changing light levels. It weighs just 2.8 ounces and easily mounts on shotguns, rifles, pistols and crossbows.



<strong>Part No. / Description / MSRP </strong>

849848 KASPA 1-4x24 VZT Reticle; Mossy Oak Camo $259.99

849255 Micro Dot Sight $108.45]]>

    <title>Kimber Mountain Ascent: A True Featherweight</title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=26233</link>

      <![CDATA[When I first opened the box to <a href="http://www.kimberamerica.com/" target="_blank">Kimber’s</a> Mountain Ascent rifle my first thought was, “Where were you 35 years ago?” At that time I did quite a bit of hunting out of a backpack at elevations approaching 11,000 feet and every ounce was a literal pain to carry up those alpine mountain sides. The synthetic stock probably would have given me pause then, but once I had an opportunity to shoot it and see how well it performed, I would have heartily embraced it.



The Mountain Ascent is an obtusely skeletonized version of the company’s popular model 84 line of rifles. In the 84M, it chambers .308 Win.-length cartridges; the 84L handles .30-06-length cartridges. And when I say obtusely skeletonized, I mean it. In the past, riflemakers have typically turned down the diameters of barrels and, maybe, made a few lightening cuts on the receiver to remove weight from ultra-light rifles. Before the synthetic stock blew away traditional walnut stocks, gunmakers might also rout out some excess wood in the barrel channel and under the buttplate. This usually gave the hunter who craved a super-lightweight rifle a starting weight of 6 to 7 pounds, sans the scope and mount. The Mountain Ascent comes out of the box at a phenomenal 4 pounds, 13 ounces in the 84M configuration and 5 pounds, 5 ounces in the 84L version-as my test sample was.



Kimber has accomplished this incredible weight loss by removing every conceivable amount of non-necessary metal from tang to muzzle. First, there is no floor plate; the magazine box remains blued steel with a composite follower. The trigger guard is given a novel treatment with no forward tang; rather there is a small screw that engages the forward portion of the guard from within the inletting of the stock. Up front the receiver ring is trimmed to 1.142 inches in diameter, and the barrel is a mere 1.048 inches where it mates with the receiver. Typically most lightweight barrels are about 1.125 inches at that point. The barrel retains this diameter through the chamber area but rapidly tapers to 0.561 inches to a point about ½ inch from the muzzle where it is stepped down for threading for an enclosed muzzle brake. Four 8-inch flutes are cut into the barrel just forward of the chamber to remove even more weight. The bolt has a major diameter of 0.588 inches, slightly smaller than normal; diameter of the bolt lugs measures 0.788 inches. Three relatively deep spiral flutes remove some more weight for 3 ¾ inches of the bolt length. The Mauser-style claw extractor is just .340-inches wide and has three 0.125 x 0.418-inch slots piercing it to further reduce weight. Even the bolt handle has three lightening flutes along an already diminished diameter, and the knob is hollowed as well. This is true minimalist engineering.



The Kevlar/carbon-fiber stock weighs in at 1 pound, 10 ounces, and the 1-inch Pachmayr Decelerator recoil pad contributes about 11 ounces to that weight. It is finished in what Kimber calls its Optifade Open Country camo pattern, a more-or-less green digital camouflage. The stock is without checkering, but the finish is sticky enough to make the lack of checkering a non-issue. It is pillar bedded and held to the barreled action with two hex-head screws.



The Mountain Ascent comes with a muzzle brake, which initially induced a case of the vapors in me until I noticed the thread protector that was also included. Yes, a rifle weighing a bit over 6 pounds is going to smack you harder than a heavier one, even when chambered for a relatively mild cartridge as the .270 Win. Nonetheless, I still maintain that if you cannot handle the recoil of a lightweight rifle without a muzzle brake, it might be time to learn-unless you happen to be one of those who believe hearing aids are a fashion accessory. Each person has the right to make that choice for themselves, but you don’t have the right to trash your companions’ hearing.



Flyweight rifles have a reputation for being finicky about the ammunition a given example prefers. A couple of my favorite handloads performed so-so at the range, but <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester’s</a> 130-grain Super X Power Max with its bonded-core hollow point beat my loads by just a bit. Like all ultra-lights, the Mountain Ascent needs to have just the right amount of restraint on the bench to show its inherent accuracy. If you shoot it like any standard-weight rifle with little or no restraint, it will flop around like a mackerel on the deck of a party boat. Too much, or an inconsistent restraint on the rifle will yield groups reminiscent of an improved cylinder shotgun. Finding just the right amount often takes some time-and ammo.



The dedicated foot hunter will likely fall in love with the Mountain Ascent. Besides being lightweight, it’s pretty accurate to boot. And it, after all, is a Kimber. The design is classic control-round-feed; its trigger is crisp and light enough to extract the most accuracy from this rifle, and the stock-while it doesn’t have the panache of Claro walnut-is impervious to just about anything. It is pure a hunting rifle all the way through.

    <title>Preparing a Home Defense Plan</title>

      <![CDATA[If life was fair, your home would be a safe place, your sanctuary, your castle. It would be the one place where you were completely separate from all the cares of the world. Sadly, such is not the case.  One merely needs to read the newspapers to see the number of home invasions that violate American homes and families virtually every day. Every home is a potential target for criminal activity; none are exempt.



For this reason, it is critical to have a <a title="Learn more about making a home-defense plan." href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13299&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=26" target="_blank">home-defense plan</a> that will make your home a less likely target and protect your family until the police can arrive and take charge. Since families are so different, no one plan will fit every home. Each family must create a plan that fits their home and situation. What follows are three broad areas that every family should consider in developing their own home-defense plan.



<strong>Harden the Target</strong>

If you built a house that was impossible to get into, you would have a house that you couldn't get out of either. What a homeowner should do is make his or her house difficult to break into and one that causes a lot of noise should a break-in occur. Noise is your friend. It let's you know that something is wrong and gives you a bit of time to prepare to deal with the problem.



All external doors should be solid, hard-core doors. While this is usually the case in new homes, one should not take it for granted. The next step is to check the locks on all of the doors and windows. Make sure they work. If they seem worn out, or flimsy, they should be replaced. By the way, it's not only an excellent idea to lock the house when you leave, it is equally as important to lock the door behind you when you return home.



On the outside of the house, it is a good idea to have adequate lighting on all sides of the house. This way, you can see who is out there and your neighbors can see if someone is prowling around.  It is also a good idea to avoid having large shrubs next to the house as this can provide some concealment for criminals as they stage their attack.



Finally, regarding making the home a safer place to live, many police departments are happy to have one of their officers come by your house and make a security evaluation. And there is nothing like getting ideas for security upgrades from the folks who actually have to investigate burglaries and home invasions.



<strong>The Safe Room</strong>

One room in the house should be designated as the Safe Room. This is the room where the family will gather should a criminal attack occur. Since many such attacks occur at night, most people select the master bedroom as the safe room.



Ideally, the safe room will have a solid-core door installed with strong locks. The room should also include places of cover that will stop bullets. The bed, itself, may serve this purpose, as will other types of furniture. It would also be comforting if the room had an attached bathroom since one never knows how long it will take the police to restore peace and order in the rest of the house.



Since criminals may have cut off your electricity and phone lines, the room should be stocked with several flashlights, and other sources of light, along with several cell phones. It should also have a supply of whatever medications a family member might need. In addition, a good first-aid kit is necessary since family members may have been injured while getting to the room. If one is trained in the defensive use of firearms, this is also the place for storing guns and extra ammunition.



Once the family has ensconced themselves in the safe room they only come out at the direction of responding police officers. Anyone who forces themselves into the room becomes silhouetted in the doorway and makes an excellent target. One just simply does not wander around the house looking for bad guys unless absolutely necessary.



<strong>The Home-Defense Plan &amp; Your Family</strong>

Developing a procedure for defending against a home invasion should involve the whole family. Everyone in the family should understand when and how to get to the safe room. And once in the safe room, just about everyone in the family can play a part in protecting the family. Family members trained in defensive shooting may be prepared to deal with a forced entry, while other family members may be on the phone to the police, providing details. The more information you can supply to the police, the more effective their response can be. Tell them where they can find a house key (not under the doormat, please) to make their entry. Tell them where in the house the safe room is located. In fact, if there is an external door to the safe room, the police might be able to enter that way and get you and your family out before they engage the criminals. Once the police are on the phone, never hang up. The entire conversation will be recorded and you can also keep them informed as to what is going on before and during their arrival.



A family home-defense plan should involve numerous family planning sessions that involve the whole family. You must make the decision as to how mature your children are and what defensive duties they can perform. Just don't exclude them from the planning process because you would be surprised at some of the good ideas that kids can come up with.



Finally, you should also have a plan for making an organized retreat from the safe room and the house. This may become necessary if the house catches fire. Or police, once they have arrived, might instruct you to leave the house and go to their staging area.



I have not said anything about what kind of guns should be in the house because that is not as important as knowing how to use the guns that you have. If you keep guns for personal defense you are honor bound to get proper defensive training with them. Having hunted all your life doesn't make you a gunfighter. It is just that simple; if you keep defensive firearms you need to get professional defensive training for everyone in the family that might use them. Besides several great defensive schools around the country, the <a href="http://home.nra.org/" target="_blank">National Rifle Association</a> offers good, relatively inexpensive classes aimed directly at personal and home-defense.



A home defense plan isn't just about dealing with the bad guys. Your family meetings can also discuss procedures in case of fire, tornado, hurricane or other natural threat. Besides these are also times for the entire family to be together and to work together toward a common goal.



Your home defense is what you make it. And your family can be your winning team. Now is the time to prepare your defense. If you wait until you hear glass break, it might be entirely too late.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[In addition to what was discussed in the article, Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design, or CPTED, is the text book answer to improving your 'position.'  It provides a good starting point for the beginner through expert when considering how to improve the security of a 'hard site.'  It is a systematic approach that helps layer a security plan beginning with the overall physical layout of the property to the mentality of the neighborhood and neighbors concerning the safety and security of everyone in the area.  Taking ownership of your area and pride in your ability to protect your family and neighbors is probably one of the biggest fallacy of our society today.  For example, looking personnel who walk through your neighborhood and greeting them with a wave or “hello” while looking them right in the eye is for most, a thing of the past.  However, what better way to tell a bad person, “I have seen your face and can ID you” all the while being cordial, some would say “nice” but I just think it is smart.  Additionally, what about writing down license plate numbers of vehicles that seem out of place or taking a picture of someone/something that does not look right.  I know, long winded.  Use your internet access for something worthwhile; look up CPTED and put it in your tool box of knowledge.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[What about Zombi attacks?!  Just kidding.  I found it very informative and was reminded there is a difference with home-defense.  I'm sure depending on the State, the laws will be different when a confrontation regarding firearms occurs.  Its good to know that the NRA also offers classes for that. Another thought; some houses may have elderly, and it might be that more than one 'safe-room' may be necessary, perhaps using the mobile phone idea for communication between the two locations.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Basic but not bad advice. Make sure that if you get LEOs to come to your home / property and share with them your concerns and what you already have in place, that you can trust them. IMHO, no defensive plan is good enough if anyone else knows about what you have/are prepared for/etc. Keep it private, don't brag about it, make sure only your family members know of it and keep it private and low profile also. ]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[A safe room is a nice idea for some people....especially those who have no clue as to how to legally take a proactive attitude against an intruder bent on rape or murder.



Sadly, Americans have been abandoned by the very officials and politicians who were chosen to protect us and who now call legal gun owners/users the bad guys. If I must give up my life, it won't be without a weapon in my hands, cowering in a 'safe room.']]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I have to disagree with Neil Schmidt. Going hunting for bad people in the house is far less safe than taking up a defensive position and waiting to see if the police show up before the bad guys to walk into your ambush. I used to live in a house where the only good defensible locations were bedrooms, but with a two story house I can find and fortify a defensive position near the top of the stairs so I protect all the bedrooms.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Great article, and there are a lot of good things I am going to discuss with my family.  I have to bring up what several others did already about dogs.  Mine go nuts when they hear things at night, do I take them in the safe room and let them sit at the barricaded door barking, or should I let them run around in the dark defenseless and possibly confuse and intruder?

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Chris202 - personally, unless the dog is a viable self-defense asset, I would not think for 2 seconds about whether the dog is with me in the room.  If he alerted me & my family to the intruder, he already served his purpose.  If he is large enough to defend / attack, that's icing on the cake.  And two dogs are better than one because the pack mentality gives them a lot more courage, making them not only a better deterrent but also a stronger defense.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Good article. Another staple to consider for a safe room or designated assembly point with a window is a house key that can be thrown out to responding officers. Make sure it is attached to a brightly colored larger key fob that will be easy to find in dark lawn areas. It can hang right on the door of your gun safe or inside the closet until it is needed.]]></comment_content>

    <title>Savage Model 42 Combo Gun</title>

      <![CDATA[Introduced to the market in the early 1950s, the <a href="http://www.savagearms.com/" target="_blank">Savage Arms</a> Model 24 series of over/under combo guns were available in several rifle caliber and shotshell combinations. Despite the fact that dual-caliber double-barrel long guns have not been as popular in the United States as they have been in Europe, the Model 24 in its various configurations sold well and remained in production until the late 1980s. Like many other enjoyable and practical firearms, the Model 24 did not garner as much time in the media spotlight as it deserved, but it was (and still is) a much loved field companion for those who purchased them. And so Savage Arms recently revived this platform as the Model 42.



The Model 42 combo gun features two 20-inch barrels attached to a hinged break-action receiver. The upper barrel is available in a choice of .22 Long Rifle or .22 Mag., while the lower barrel is chambered for 3-inch .410 shotgun shells. Digital calipers confirmed the choke of the lower barrel at .410 inches, making it a cylinder-bore choke instead of the full choke commonly found on fixed-choke .410s. Although the open choke will do for air-borne targets, this choice of choke is more likely to be put to work bagging small game or dispatching pests at close range.



This rifle/shotgun has a mixed materials construction that includes polymer stocks, steel barrels, steel hardware and a non-ferrous cast mono-block receiver. Instead of casting the polymer forearm into pieces or plates that would have to be held in place with screws, it is molded as a single piece that permanently encases the two blued-steel barrels. The forearm is slim with deep finger grooves on each side and textured patches along the lower edge. The shoulder stock has similar user-friendly features, including a textured pistol grip, a 13.5-inch length-of-pull and a thick, soft-rubber vented buttpad. The touch points on the stocks are sleek and trim. They'll feel comfortable in the hands of small-framed shooters, but they leave plenty of room for larger hands as well.



The blued-steel barrels sport a satin-blue finish, while the steel trigger, hammer, release lever, sling swivel studs and the various steel bolts that hold it together are treated with a matte-black finish. The polymer front sight is fixed, but the rear sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. It can also be removed and replaced with a scope mount. A cross-bolt safety located above the molded trigger guard can be engaged to prevent the hammer from striking the firing pins. Internal safeties prevent the action from either opening or closing when the hammer is fully cocked.



To fire the Model 42, start by verifying that the hammer is in the forward (uncocked) position. The action is opened by depressing the trigger-like release located in front of the trigger guard. One or both barrels can be loaded, and then the action is closed. On top of the hammer is a small, textured lever that is used to switch the hammer from one barrel to the other. Pulling back (toward the operator) switches the hammer to the upper rimfire barrel, while pressing forward (toward the muzzle) returns the hammer to the lower .410 barrel. The hammer is manually cocked for each shot.



The upper barrel of the gun tested was chambered for .22 Long Rifle, which means it will also accept .22 Long, .22 Short and .22 rimfire shotshells like the CCI Pest Control rounds. The lower barrel accepts both 2½ and 3-inch .410 shotgun shells. After one or both barrels have been discharged, the spent cases are loosened by the polymer extractor to then be manually removed from the chambers.



At the shooting range, the Model 42 proved to be a handy, reliable and enjoyable gun to shoot. It weighs in at 4 pounds, 11 ounces when unloaded, which should be a manageable, if not downright comfortable, amount of weight for most shooters to manage. Some folks believe that polymer-stocked guns can't be handsome, but this particular combo gun has sleek lines that look good coming out of a case.



The fit and finish of the Model 42 was excellent, with the hinged action locking up tightly and operating without any wobbles or rough spots. When holding the stock firmly in place at the shoulder with the shooting hand, the action would drop open for reloading with the support hand. The crisp, single-action trigger broke at 5 pounds, 10 ounces of pressure, and the long hammer spur made the hammer comfortable to cock for every shot. The buttpad was a real bonus, grabbing onto the shoulder and effectively keeping recoil to a bare minimum. Some of the heavy .410 shells, such as the 3-inch, five-pellet 000 buckshot and PDX1 mixed payload rounds from Winchester, generate a level of felt recoil on par with light 20-gauge shotshells. This may not be a concern to the experienced operators, but it’s a nice touch for recoil-sensitive or new shooters.



The formal accuracy testing for the .22 Long Rifle barrel was conducted from a benchrest, using the iron sights, by firing five, five-shot groups into targets set at 25 yards. The best single group of 1.01 inches was produced using <a href="http://www.federalpremium.com/" target="_blank">Federal's</a> American Eagle 38-grain copper-plated hollow points (CPHP). This load also produced the best five group average of 1.33 inches, followed by the <a href="http://www.cci-ammunition.com/" target="_blank">CCI</a> Velocitor 40-grain CPHP at 1.45 inches, and the <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester</a> Dynapoint 40-grain CPHP at 1.46 inches.



The performance of the cylinder-bore .410 shotshell barrel was checked by firing single rounds into targets set at 7 yards. The tightest birdshot pattern of 7.25 inches was produced by a Federal 2½-inch shell loaded with No. 4 lead shot, followed by the Winchester 2½-inch Super X No. 7 ½  at 9.5 inches and the Winchester AA 2½-inch No. 9 at 11 inches. The Federal Premium 3-inch, five-pellet 000 buckshot round produced a tight 1.25-inch pattern at 7 yards.



In choosing to revive the Model 24 with the release of the up-to-date Model 42, Savage has done a terrific job of honoring the original intent of the dual-caliber double barrel while successfully bringing the design in line with modern manufacturing techniques and materials. This combo gun is ideal for a variety of uses including small-game hunting, as a garden gun, camp gun, survival gun or all-around plinker. It’s light, reliable, flexible and fun to shoot. Savage Arms deserves kudos, not only for breathing new life into an old idea, but for producing a well-built gun that can be enjoyed and relied upon for years to come.

        <![CDATA[I have owned and used Model 24's for many years and like them very much.  There is no such thing as an 'all around gun' but in some incarnations the Model 24 is 'close enough.'  

I'm glad to see it return to the market, and that Savage chose to use the .22 LR in the current version rather than the various .17's [(]which surely are coming[)] or the .22 WMR, which is a shade too powerful and expensive for small game hunting.  

I am however very disappointed that they chose to chamber the .410 bore, however.  The .410 is a gun for an expert, and the prevailing idea that it's an 'ideal kid's gun' is wrong.  

And a cylinder bore at that!  I would hesitate to use a .410 cylinder bore even on a sitting squirrel or rabbit at normal hunting ranges, thanks to the tiny shot charge and open patterns this gun will produce.  FAR better to have used the 20 gauge [(]or even the 28[)] in this version of the Model 24.  

The old guns were very handsome products with elegant lines.  This Model 24 is...well, it's butt ugly.  That won't detract from it's 'performance' but it certainly isn't going to win any beauty contests.  Let's hope a sensible combination like the the .22LR/20 is on the market soon; and that Savage resists the temptation to chamber it in any kind of .17 caliber [(]fat chance![)].

They may also want to reintroduce another classic: the 'Four Tenner' insert that allows the feeble .410 to be used in 20 and 12 gauge guns for those who simply insist that their kids be handicapped with a less-than-optimal round.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I have owned both models of the Savage Model 24. Started with the 22LR/.410 combo and then sold it an bought the 22mag/20 ga when it was made available. I still have the 22M/20ga and it is still my go to weapon for Turkey hunting. Good to see Savage bringing these back online.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I was fortunate to come across a estate sale in which one of the origional 22/410 was part of the firearms we were asked to evaluate. It was in bad condition but had pristine barrels. I ended up buying it for $50.00 and have spent the last few months finding the missing parts and refinishing the firearm for continued use. I like it more then the new version as the barrles are welded together rather then how there spaced on the 42. But it is an awesome gun worthy of mention and great for an espiring ltiile hunter who can spend some time with dad out in the field.]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[I had a Model 24 in .22 WMR/.410 many years ago.  It was [(]and is[)] the most useless combination imaginable.  Too expensive for plinking, overpowered for small game with the rifle barrel, and hopelessly underpowered for small game with the .410 barrel.  I traded it on a .22 LR/20 gauge version which I still have and use every season.  I also own a 24F in .30-30/12, the 'big brother' of my little gun, also inherently useful.  Why Savage chose to make this gun with a cylinder bore shotgun barrel is beyond comprehension.  The .410 is a gun for an expert, not a begtinner.  It's a crippler on anything larger than chipmunks, or anything at all more than 15 yards away.  The .410 should be relegated to targets, which don't crawl in a hole and die slowly, as far too many game animals shot with a .410 do.

Quite aside from the poor choice of calibers the new Model 42 is, to be charitable, butt ugly.  The old 24's, even the heavy versions like the 24F, had a certain sleekness and grace.  The new model is clunky and without any style.  Anyone who wants a Savage combination gun would be well advised to buy a good used Model 24 in any combination and stay away from this new version.  I predict it will be out of Savage's lineup in a year or so.]]>

      <![CDATA[When the service pistol began to evolve widely in the 1960s, many of the guns were completely new designs. The ones that succeeded almost always attempted to meet three criteria that came from the military pistols of World War II. This fact was most eloquently recalled by the late Chuck Karwan in “Combat Handgunnery” over 20 years ago. The criteria were (1) a DA (or DA/SA) trigger system, (2) a high-capacity magazine and (3) a more powerful cartridge. There were a lot of new semi-auto pistols in an America poised to hang up its wheelguns. Many of these new police and military service pistols had a feature that apparently came out of thin air, because I can’t find anyone willing to take the credit (blame?) for it.



The feature was a unique trigger guard shape, which had either a flat face or a sharp hook on the front edge.  A few pistolsmiths had been modifying 1911 pistols to have this contour. That is somewhat understandable in an atmosphere where combat shooting was growing in popularity and the Weaver stance was coming into vogue. In a two-handed stance, the non-shooting (support) hand wraps around the shooting hand, which is pushing the gun forward. The support hand pulls back and the resulting push-pull effect stabilizes the gun nicely. Some shooters started using the support hand trigger finger to reach up and pull back on the trigger guard. To make it just a little easier, designers began to flatten or hook the trigger guard and before you could say Jack Weaver, it was there for keeps.



Then a bunch of hard-core handgunners who ran serious evaluation of every technique, tactic and tool they could find, discovered that this finger forward business didn’t work. In fact, holding a pistol in this grip often caused interference with the real trigger finger. Also, the finger-forward position is not as strong as you might think. The rearward pulling effort is actually somewhat divided and while the effect might be acceptable for a first single shot, it is not for multiples. Combat shooting involves managing the recoil of a hard kicking service handgun for as many shots as it takes to resolve a serious threat. Fortunately the trigger guard shape, developed to facilitate this ill-advised shooting technique, is easy to deal with. You just ignore it.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I think the finger on trigger guard hold is for the most part obsolete, but not quite outmoded yet. There is still a place for it, depending on your shooting stance. As a young shooter, I once used it quite happily, but eventually grew out of it like the above hard core handgunners. But back then, I favored an Isosceles stance, which I’ll bet these handgunners used to base their opinions. With your gun way out there and elbows locked, then yes, it feels more natural and stronger not to use it. But as I’m getting older now and my eyes less sharp, I’ve been migrating more toward a traditional combat Weaver stance. Body slightly canted, with the gun a bit closer to better acquire my sights,  and elbows not locked. In this position, it actually feels more natural to want to rest your finger on the trigger guard, and is less of a strain on your wrist. For me, this translates into guiding my sight alignment to a much quicker first shot on target. If you believe the first accurately placed shot is the most critical one to quickly ending a gunfight with a Weaver stance, then a finger on trigger guard hold can still make sense even in this day and age.  But at the same time, I’ve also found that precious space in front of the trigger guard is also quite useful to mount a flashlight/laser nowadays. Something my tired eyes also need. And that also translates into that first accurate shot on target at night. But with that mounted, there’s once again no place for your index finger to rest anymore. It’s a matter of personal choice of shooting stance and accessory placement that dictate its use. So for a small percentage of shooters, it can still make sense to use it for a tactical advantage. Here’s a previous AR reference article on various shooting stances, if anyone’s interested:  http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/choosing-a-handgun-shooting-stance/]]></comment_content>

<a href="http://www.shootersworld.com/" target="_blank">Shooter’s World</a> in Tampa, Fla., is a 62,000-sq.-ft. facility, making it one of the biggest gun stores in America. Its impressive size, however, hasn’t diminished its gun-shop charm. Owners Dr. Greg Henderson and Bing Kearney wanted to create a gun store with a deep inventory, a state-of-the-art shooting range and professional instruction, but they also wanted it to be family-friendly, unlike the cold big-box feel some stores have. By working with gun manufacturers on displays and more, they pulled it off. Shooter’s World jars loose memories of duck blinds and grandfather’s gun cabinet, but it is also open and inviting with aisles of inventory, an onsite range with 27 pistol lanes and seven 100-yd. indoor rifle lanes that can handle up to a .50 BMG.



Shooters World has a training facility with experienced instructors. The superstore has two retail departments for every type of shooter in addition to an extensive selection of firearms. Shooters World offers the region’s only lifetime warranty program for all new and certified pre-owned firearms. Its range provides an assortment of gun rentals, and it offers more than 30 NRA-certified courses, including a Florida concealed-carry class, basic-to-advanced classes and youth classes, as well as couples and ladies-only instruction. The classes, designed to accommodate a wide variety of shooters, are taught by trained, certified instructors with an emphasis on creating an enjoyable learning environment.



In addition, it has implemented a comprehensive museum where visitors can gain an understanding of the important role firearms have played in securing the freedoms we enjoy. Henderson says, “In today’s world of political correctness we have seen many Americans lose sight of the fact that our liberty was purchased at a dear price. We built this museum because we believe that Americans need a refresher course on the fact that the fundamental freedoms we enjoy were fought for and won by our Founding Fathers with the understanding that government is for the benefit of the individual, not the other way around. We also believe that as the Second Amendment goes, so goes the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. You cannot selectively delete portions of our Constitution for political expediency. We are staunch supporters of the NRA’s efforts to preserve the inalienable rights enumerated within the Constitution.” Shooter’s World is located at 116 E. Fletcher Ave., Tampa, FL 33612; (813) 381-1111; <a href="http://www.shootersworld.com/" target="_blank">shootersworld.com</a>.]]>

    <title>Your Guide To The Changing Marketplace Of Gun Sales</title>

      <![CDATA[<em>Photo Courtesy of Bass Pro Shops</em>



Most gun salesmen spend their time in front of racks of guns. Not Chad Seaverns. He spends his days in a virtual mall. As the chief operating officer of the <a href="http://nfdnetwork.com/" target="_blank">National Firearms Dealer Network</a> (NFDN) he believes he has a good part of your gun-buying future in his hands.



Sure, Seaverns knows that a survey conducted by the <a href="http://www.nssf.org/" target="_blank">National Shooting Sports Foundation</a> (NSSF) found that only 13 percent of gun sales were started online in 2011. But he sees that as a fine beginning, saying the 87 percent represents raw potential. NFDN looks at the dynamic marketplace fueled by record gun sales and a growing number of gun owners (more than 100 million in the United States) with optimism and predicts tremendous growth online.



“A lot of people don’t know about all the deals out there and new buying options for firearms and related products,” says Seaverns. “Our company can help them find those deals through live-streaming technology.”



When you log onto nfdmall.com storefronts appear on your computer’s screen-digital street signs for <a href="http://www.berettausa.com/" target="_blank">Beretta</a>, <a href="http://www.mossberg.com" target="_blank">Mossberg</a>, <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com" target="_blank">Smith &amp; Wesson</a> and many other gunmakers. You’ll be able to shop by company or firearm type. You can just go right in with a few clicks to check out whatever you’re after. As you do you’ll cleanly view competing products and see technical information that’ll make you an educated consumer.



Of course you can’t walk out of a virtual mall with a gun. Your order will be sent to a nearby gun dealer that has a Federal Firearms License (FFL). You can then go right into the gun shop of your choosing and complete your purchase-after going through a background check, of course.



The local gun store won’t mind, either, because it gets the sale. It simply pays NFDN a monthly fee for the service. NFDN provides the gun shop with a website template that it can modify and control. The store can even upload more products and name its own prices. Basically, NFDN is a central hub that sends your searches into the deep databases of the four largest distributors. When you choose a product-a gun, riflescope or whatever-you click “Buy Now” and then choose where you want to physically purchase your product. As you do that you are seamlessly transferred to a website maintained by a local gun shop or sporting goods retailer.



A great benefit of the system is that you can find almost anything real-time in the distributors’ warehouses. Your local gun shop might not have a magazine for your <a href="http://www.sigsauer.com/" target="_blank">SIG Sauer P938</a>, but NFDN’s real-time link to the distributors’ databases will likely turn up whatever you’re after. You can even compare prices by using NFDN’s site to check the websites of your local gun stores.



That’s just the beginning of why Seaverns thinks he has a bead on the future of gun sales at nfdmall.com. Maybe you’ve seen some of your local gun shops go bust. Maybe you’ve lamented that those independent little stores with the gun guru behind the counter are being beat-out by the big-box stores and destination retailers. Maybe you still go to a local gun shop when you can because the service is so good and because you know that the guys or gals behind the counter know their guns. Well, NFDN works exclusively with those types of stores.



“We encourage the stores we work with to have a kiosk in the store so they can help customers look up and order anything they don’t have in stock,” says Seaverns. “Most products will be delivered within a few days.”



NFDN has already signed up more than 560 local stores and is growing. As it expands, NFDN is helping to level the playing field for local sporting goods stores. This isn’t to say that one type of store is better than another, but rather that more competition-choices for you-is a good thing.



All this makes NFDN different from businesses such as gunbroker.com and other online gun-auction sites, but it doesn’t displace the important niche such sites have established. <a href="http://www.gunbroker.com" target="_blank">Gunbroker.com</a> links buyers and sellers and uses local licensed firearm dealers as transfer agents (stores with FFLs typically charge between $20 and $50 to do a background check and, if approved, transfer a firearm). At auction sites you have the tools to locate hard-to-find used guns and to possibly get deals. Though it should be noted that even gunbroker.com is hard to categorize in this evolving marketplace, as it isn’t just a gun-auction site. It also offers hunting gear, collectibles and other goods.



At press time gunbroker.com had many more receiving FFLs listed than did NFDN, but the latter is a young and growing company so that’s to be expected.



There are, of course, other online players in the market. <a href="http://www.gunsamerica.com" target="_blank">Gunsamerica.com</a>, for example, calls itself the “Largest online gun classifieds since 1997.” It says it is dealing with so much change in the marketplace that it placed a disclaimer on the website that reads, “[P]lease don’t be alarmed or get too miffed at us if you see something you do not like or notice something is not working properly. All you need to do is contact customer service and let us know.” That’s a sign that a company is trying to keep up with the competition in an evolving marketplace-again, that’s good for you.



A downside to buying used firearms from private sellers, of course, is that some deals are too good to be true. Online businesses that link buyers and private sellers through an FFL mostly have good reputations and tools for consumers to use to avoid being taken, but you do have to be careful.



NFDN doesn’t have that problem, as consumers using nfdmall.com are actually buying new goods from local gun shops or sporting goods stores. That’s not to say one buying option is better than the other, but simply that there are more options than ever. Speaking of choices, the brick-and-mortar stores haven’t been idle. There is a lot more to this story on the changing marketplace of gun sales.



<strong>The Big-Store Expansion</strong>



At the end of 2013, <a href="http://www.cabelas.com" target="_blank">Cabela’s</a> had 50 stores and plans to open 13 more in 2014. Bass Pro Shops had 59 stores and plans to open about a half dozen more in 2014. At press time Bass Pro’s latest store opening was a 104,000-sq.-ft. store in Round Rock, Texas-the second fastest growing city in 2012, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. This is <a href="http://www.basspro.com/" target="_blank">Bass Pros’</a> seventh store in Texas. The company estimated that 116 million people would visit its 77 stores (including Tracker Marine Centers) across America and Canada in 2013-about 40 million more than attend Major League Baseball games during a typical year.



To attain such growth Cabela’s and Bass Pro Shops have turned their retail stores into attractions that bring the outdoors inside with top-quality taxidermy, aquariums stocked with monster bass, indoor mountains and archery ranges. Currently, the largest Cabela’s retail facility is in Hamburg, Pa. It has more than 250,000 sq.-ft. of floor space. Bass Pro says its average customer stays two and a half hours and drives an average distance of 50-plus miles. Cabela’s has similar statistics.



In fact, Ralph Castner, Cabela’s chief financial officer, says, “A lot of people drive 100 miles or more to go to our stores. We’re expanding to make their drives shorter and to reach new customers. They come a long way because we offer deals on gear, large firearm selections and because our stores host a lot of events and attractions.”



Cabela’s is a publicly traded corporation trading under “CAB.” Cabela’s founders, Dick and Mary Cabela and Dick’s brother, James Cabela, began Cabela’s in 1961 and took the company public in 2004. About half of Cabela’s sales come from hunting-related merchandise with about a third coming from the sale of firearms, ammunition and accessories in 2012. Also, in 2012 about 30 percent of Cabela’s revenue came from catalogs that have long been goody lists for sportsmen.



Bass Pro Shops is a privately owned corporation. In 1971, Johnny Morris rented a U-Haul trailer and took off across the country filling it with the newest premium fishing tackle he could find. When he returned to Springfield, Mo., he set up shop in his father’s liquor store, which was located on the way to Table Rock Lake. The site of the original Bass Pro store in Springfield now brings in more than 4 million visitors annually and is the state’s top tourist attraction.



As both companies expand, they’re moving to regions where consumers want them-not necessarily to places most would think of as synonymous with outdoor recreation. For example, Bass Pro’s store in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., is just over an hour’s ride from Santa Monica, a bastion of anti-gun rallies and restaurants that cater to vegans. This 180,000-sq.-ft. store sells firearms, predator calls, the latest camouflage and other products most people don’t think of when California comes to mind; nevertheless, the hunters and gun owners are there and can grab an NRA flier by the door and order “Hunter on Fire” (a chicken sandwich with spicy buffalo sauce) from Uncle Buck’s Fishbowl &amp; Grill on site.



Cabela’s opened a store in East Hartford, Conn., in 2007 and plans to open a store in Berlin, Mass., in 2015. Meanwhile, Bass Pro is planning to open a 200,000-sq.-ft. Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World in Sayreville, New Jersey, just off the Garden State Parkway. That there are enough sportsmen and gun owners to support mega-stores with firearms and many other products in these “blue states” shouldn’t surprise many hunters and gun owners, but it can be a shock to urban anti-gun elites. Regardless, these stores offer events, gun-training courses and more.



Cabela’s and Bass Pro Shops, of course, are hardly the only players in the market for your gun dollars. Other big chain stores have taxidermy, often have gunsmiths on the premises and hold classes that teach gun safety, handling and more. Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc., for example, is a Fortune 500 American corporation that trades on the market under the stock ticker “DKS.” It was founded in 1948 when then 18-year-old Dick Stack quit an Army surplus store in Binghamton, N.Y., after the store owner mocked his ideas for stocking fishing tackle. Dick started a tackle store with $300 from his grandmother. Dick’s now has more than 450 stores in 42 states.



<a href="http://www.gandermountain.com/" target="_blank">Gander Mountain</a>, headquartered in St. Paul, Minn., currently has 119 stores in 23 states. It began as a catalog-based retailer in Wilmot, Wis., but sold its mail-order business to Cabela’s in 1996. Formerly traded on NASDAQ, Gander Mountain was turned into a private company under the majority ownership of David Pratt and the Erickson family.



Then there’s <a href="http://www.sportsmanswarehouse.com/" target="_blank">Sportsman’s Warehouse</a>, an outdoor sporting goods retailer that operates 47 stores in 18 states. Sportsman’s Warehouse calls itself “America’s Premier Outfitter.” To interact with its customers Sportsman’s Warehouse offers concealed-carry classes and more. (Go to sportsmanswarehouse.com/events to see what they’re up to in your neighborhood.)



All these competing chains and more are expanding and trying to grab a piece of the hot and growing gun market. According to the research firm Southwick Associates, Inc., ammunition sales were up 15 percent from 2011 to 2012, shooting accessories were up 30 percent and the share of rifle sales chambered in .223 Rem. was up 14 percent (in 2012 one in five rifles sold was chambered in .223 Rem.). Of course ammunition, especially .22 Long Rifle, .223 Rem. and 9 mm Luger, has been in such high demand during the past few years that there have been wide and prolonged shortages across the country. Gun sales have generally been going up every year since 2000, surged in 2008 (just before President Barack Obama was elected), and haven’t fallen off since.



“The biggest change I see this year is that people in their twenties and thirties have become a bigger part of the market,” says Rob Southwick of Southwick Associates, Inc. “Those in this demographic are now buying rifles-especially modern sporting rifles-and they’re shooting for fun.”



Scott Blackwell, president of Freedom Group, an American firearm manufacturer holding company that includes <a href="http://www.remington.com" target="_blank">Remington</a>, <a href="http://www.bushmaster.com/index.asp" target="_blank">Bushmaster</a> and <a href="http://www.dpmsinc.com/" target="_blank">DPMS</a>, notes that they sell their firearms with standard pricing that doesn’t give the larger stores an advantage over smaller retailers. He says, “It’s an increasingly diverse marketplace and that’s good for those buying guns and for us. Last year Wal-Mart sent a flier to millions of households that advertised Remington guns. Meanwhile, larger retailers have deep inventories, but the small and medium-size gun stores have a knowledge base that’s hard for the big stores to compete with. This increasingly diverse marketplace is good for America’s gun owners and our American-made products.”



<strong>Local Firearm Superstores</strong>



New online options and destination stores get most of the national attention, but there’s something else taking place in the center of the market, without which this article would have a hole. Some regional stores have been growing even as they keep their local appeal.



Gat Guns in Dundee, Ill., located about an hour and half west of Chicago, for example, has expanded several times since first opening in 1979. After a recent expansion it now has 63 shooting positions. Greg Torino, owner of Gat Guns, says, “We’re excited and are big supporters of the NRA. We’re the 50th state to win our right to carry concealed. This is a boon to freedom and to our bottom line.”



Randy Potter, Gat Guns’ store manager, says, “Ten years ago we had two women working behind the counter. We now have nine. We have women-only classes taught by a lady who is an International Practical Shooting Confederation shooter. We’ve also opened up our aisles, added more lights, put in granite counter tops and more. We’re catering more and more to suburban moms and dads. We now rent 160 firearm types and have instructors available for anyone who needs them.



“Over the last few decades our consumers have changed and we’ve changed with them,” said Potter. “I just sold an AR-15 to a guy who has hunted all his life but now wants a rifle for home defense. We used to get mostly hunters. Now we also get a lot of women and young men who want to shoot recreationally and to defend themselves.”



Another must-visit regional store is Bill’s Gun Shop and Range, which has two locations in Minnesota (Robbinsdale and Circle Pines) and one in Hudson, Wis.-each location has 64 lanes in its range and rents guns. Owner John Monson says, “Guns are still selling, but sales have eased off a bit. For a while it was challenging just to keep guns and ammo in stock. We’re fully stocked now. We have ranges at all our stores, host a ladies night every Wednesday and cherish our customers here in Minnesota and Wisconsin. I could sell more guns and certainly more ammo online, but I don’t want to do that. I serve the customers who come to our stores.”



Other regional gun stores are also earning their customers. In Ashland, Va., there’s Green Top, a 55,000-sq.-ft. gun store that’s a local landmark. Then there’s ATP Guns in Summerville, S.C., a store that says it is “The Most Lady-Friendly Gun Shop this Side of the Mason-Dixon Line.” They have a “Ladies Night” every Tuesday and Thursday and explain that these training sessions are designed for “ladies that have never shot a gun” or who were “trained incorrectly… .”



Many store owners realize that there are now more than 5 million women participating in the shooting sports, an increase of 46.5 percent since 2001. In fact, those independent gun stores sold 43 percent of the handguns sold in 2011, according to a report by the NSSF.



This is the kind of thinking and expertise that is winning new customers in the growing marketplace for guns. There are a lot of other examples-<a href="http://www.shootersworld.com/" target="_blank">Shooter’s World</a> in Tampa, Fla. (see p. 63), the Arkansas Armory near Little Rock, Wades Guns in Bellevue, Wash., and many more. Behind all this growth and innovative thinking is a new future being built on a foundation of pro-Second Amendment legislation and programs backed and run by the NRA.



<strong>SIDEBAR:</strong> <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/welcome-to-shooters-world" target="_blank">Welcome to Shooter's World</a>



A recent NSSF survey found that the primary motive for recent handgun purchases is concealed carry (32 percent), followed by non-competitive shooting (28 percent) and then home defense (24 percent). Two-thirds of handgun owners said they are likely to purchase another handgun within the next year. Also, 30 percent of handgun purchasers bought their first and only handgun within the past year.



Bruce Hammond, director of marketing and communications for the <a href="http://www.nsga.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=1" target="_blank">National Sporting Goods Association</a> (NSGA), says the regional stores have been earning their market share. He says, “While we see an increase in online purchases, the increases online are modest as compared to the specialty sport shop channel.”



According to the NSGA, between 2010 and 2012, the percentage of rifles purchased at specialty sports shops (gun shops, outdoor stores, etc.) increased from 31.8 percent to 37.3 percent, while online purchases increased from 5.1 percent to 7.8 percent. However, it’s difficult to separate those numbers, as sales that begin online are sometimes completed in gun and sporting goods stores. NFDN, for example, doesn’t get in the middle of gun transactions, but rather facilitates sales. In this modern economy one is helping the other and that’s certainly the future of guns sales.]]>

    <title>Wilson Combat Spec-Ops 9</title>

      <![CDATA[Ever since Colt developed the Commander in 1949, the 1911 pistol has been modified, adapted, tweaked and improved for comfortable carry and easier concealment. <a href="http://wilsoncombat.com/new/handgun-spec-ops-9.asp" target="_blank">Wilson Combat</a> continues this trend with the Spec-Ops 9, a pistol based on the Commander-size platform but made even better for concealed carry through numerous modern enhancements.



The 9 in Spec-Ops 9 refers to the pistol’s chambering, that being the popular 9 mm Luger. 1911 fans may think of that as heresy, but remember, the Commander was originally introduced in 9 mm. Unlike the first Commander pistols, though, the Spec-Ops 9 holds 16 rounds in its double-stack magazine.



To learn more about the Wilson Combat Spec-Ops 9 check out the video below, hosted by <a href="http://www.shootingillustrated.com/" target="_blank"><em>Shooting Illustrated's</em></a> Adam Heggenstaller.

<strong>Barrel Length:</strong> 4.5"

    <title>Opening Up To Off-Body Carry</title>

      <![CDATA[Today’s armed citizen has more options than ever before when it comes to carrying a handgun or long gun intended for self-preservation in an off-body mode. That’s good to know when one considers the advantages of having a defensive arm nearby in situations where on-body carry might not be  practical or comfortable.



But along with the advantages of being able to have quick access to the greater capabilities of a long gun and of traveling with a lower profile than when carrying a handgun in an on-body holster, off-body carry also requires an extra degree of vigilance on the part of the concealed carry practitioner. The possibility of a gun being inadvertently left behind or taken is far greater when it is not physically attached to the user.



The truth is that whatever method you choose to carry a gun for personal protection, you must always be aware of the status of the firearm and the means by which it is secured to its carrier.



There are times, places, user groups, and activities where modern and functional discreet packs offer the only effective means for carrying or transporting a firearm. When instructing concealed carry classes, one example I point to is the use of small, simple pouches for bicycling or motorcycling. While hardcore cyclists might make better use of a holster slipped into one of the zippered compartments their tight-fitting garments often contain, the great number of casual or average-attired street riders peddling around America these days would be better-served by a conveniently sized, well-positioned, stable and readily accessible waist pack. One that is comfortable and as unobtrusive as possible will still allow the gun to be drawn with relative ease.



The same thing is true for motorcyclists. I always rode with a heavy vest or jacket that had a strong-side, external slash pocket with a secure but easily opened hook-and-loop closure, which allowed easy access to an immovable holster and small revolver inside the pocket. Many people, though, dress far more casually. A modern, non-contrasting pack or pouch might not only work better with those clothes but might also ease mounting and dismounting the bike. While carrying a gun and other valuables, such a bag might also attract less attention when momentarily stepping away from the bike to eat, stretch out or go to the restroom.



I think waist packs also have a real advantage for certain vacationers. Consider the activities you might find yourself doing when the family heads off for a week of car-based sightseeing. How many times might you (sometimes in a single day) be in and out of the car or changing clothes to suit the climate and activity. Also in the course of that single day, you’re likely to be sitting as much as standing: perhaps confined behind the wheel of a car or by a booth in a diner.



Are you going to change your holster every time the conditions change? I doubt it. And while paddle holsters are versatile; and pocket holsters discreet; and tuckable, inside-the-waistband models a good compromise, none of them works equally well in all manner of situations or scenarios. So as much as I might decry the dated “fanny pack” concept, for many applications a more recent iteration of that design, from makers such as <a href="http://www.desantisholster.com/" target="_blank">DeSantis</a> or <a href="http://www.unclemikes.com/holsters" target="_blank">Uncle Mike’s</a>, might be just the ticket.



For people walking about town or spending a day hiking trails, a myriad of field packs and urban backpacks allow their wearers to bring along a handgun that’s not only completely unseen when casually opening and closing the bag, but also positioned so that it can be drawn whether the device is on or off the body. Blackhawk and other makers have backpacks and slingpacks that look reasonably natural in a wide variety of environments and are well suited for carrying firearms, and other daily essentials.



People who, like me, are a bit old-fashioned, believe the briefcase is still the go-to package for transporting necessities during the work day. A search of catalogs from some of the more reputable manufacturers reveals that there are many gun-carrying options for those who prefer this venerable carrier. Tactical briefcases, discreet options and examples in several sizes and materials are available in the ever-expanding market.



But with an eye toward urbanization (and with many previously anti-gun cities now allowing concealed carry within their borders), there is also a whole subgroup of shoulder bags and so-called “Messenger Bags” that subtly fit into that look and lifestyle as well; giving people in more fashion-conscious environments the ability to blend. Woolstenhulme makes contemporary bags that look great and, like all good ones, carry the gun separately from other contents so that the firearm is readily available and unobstructed by other items of cargo. Blackhawk also makes several bags that fall into this category.



Of course, carrying a bag or a briefcase around with you all day once you’re at the office or your place of business isn’t always possible. There, a portfolio or a day planner/calendar might be a better choice, but, once again, you need to think things through. In our constantly evolving electronic society, more and more people rely on the calendars stored in and synchronized between their laptops, tablets and smart phones. So in some working environments, a handheld appointment book-something so common everywhere just 10 years ago-would look as out of place today as some of those older-style waist packs I described earlier. Therefore, need and environment must both be examined before you settle on an appropriate design.



As much as I find myself using an electronic device these days, I still use a “real” notepad for jotting down certain things and for roughing out sketches of the projects I’m working on. As such, something like Galco’s Hidden Agenda works very well for both those tasks and carrying a gun-something that most of its competitors’ models don’t do-when I am working somewhere that my activities or mode of dress won’t allow me to position a gun on my body.



I have designed purses suitable for concealed carry for others, and I teach with them regularly. They too, are something that has seen tremendous advancements in recent years. Traditionally, they were dated, often unattractive and not always functional. Today, the better ones are well designed in terms of both appearance and performance. <a href="http://www.galcogunleather.com/" target="_blank">Galco’s </a>full line of designer purses reflects the sense of style and penchant for detail that has been its hallmark for decades. But relative newcomers such as <a href="http://www.designerconcealedcarry.com/" target="_blank">Woolstenhulme</a> and <a href="http://www.guntotenmamas.com/" target="_blank">Gun Tote’n Mamas</a> are doing a great job with purses as well. And products found on websites such as <a href="http://www.theconcealmentshop.com/index.php" target="_blank">theconcealmentshop.com</a> show that others, too, are advancing the state of the art in terms of purses suitable for carrying firearms.



Not everybody is looking to conceal only a handgun in an off-body manner. Some people also have a need to carry or transport a long gun in a similarly discreet way. Traditionally, however, the design of long-gun cases left little to an observer’s imagination. Even the so-called “discreet” rifle and shotgun cases were almost as obvious as the time-honored leather and canvas shotgun slips of our duck-hunting forefathers.



<a href="http://www.blackhawk.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Blackhawk’s</a> “Diversion” line not only includes a number of long gun cases that nicely fit into the Backpack, Daypack and Courier Bag categories we’ve already discussed but also includes its Racquet Bag, a wonderfully misleading design that has two full-length internal compartments, each capable of accommodating a firearm (or a broken-down AR platform) up to 29-inches long. And with an eye toward newer and more contemporary ways of hiding in plain sight, the company also offers a very common-looking but well-constructed Board Pack that is completely at home in a number of environments. That design and Blackhawk’s gym-inspired Workout Bag are also great ways of carrying your firearms to and from the car without revealing to passersby that you are transporting firearms.



Obviously there is a lot to think about regarding ways to carry a firearm with you when it cannot be attached to, or concealed upon, the body. The methods of doing so can be quite varied. But there are two traits they all share that you must always be aware of.



One is that your method of carrying a firearm-the tool upon which you might base the defense of your life-could become the reason that you need such a defense. That briefcase, purse or backpack could be why someone singles you out, not just for robbery, but perhaps for something worse. And now the gun you are carrying to save your life could be (unknown to the attacker) taken in that attack and unavailable to you.



The other consideration is the casualness about safety and responsibility that such gun carrying methods can sometimes bring about. When no longer needed, fanny packs can be tossed on car seats, tabletops and bedspreads. Purses can be left on counters or hung on the backs of chairs. Backpacks can be set on the floor, rested in shopping carts or set down next to us on public transportation or restaurant seating. Briefcases can be left behind to remain unattended on or alongside our desks. The same can be true of those portfolios and planners that I mentioned. Even discreet long gun cases can be too easily left alone for just a moment because after all, it is “just a moment” and “nobody knows there is a gun in it anyway.” Bad idea!



If you do plan on using any of these methods to go armed throughout your day, then you need to be just as much on guard against these mindset issues as you do those external threats that warranted your carrying the firearm in the first place. These off-body solutions can solve some problems but like many things in life, they can bring about others of their own making. However, if you approach them logically and carefully, they too can be resolved in your favor.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Mr. Martinez, I hate to be the one correcting anybody here but “Frebitz” is mistaken. The pictured planner is not a BLACKHAWK! but is, in fact, the one I refer to in the article. It is a Galco “Hidden Agenda” and the biggest plus it offers [(]beyond very good looks and an exterior that does not resemble a gun case[)] is the fact that it actually looks and works like a conventional scheduler. Most such planning simulators merely serve in that function when closed [(]Galco makes one of those too; its their “Defense Planner”. And for the record, BLACKHAWK! does make one like that: they call it their “Day Planner Holster”.[)], so if you are merely looking for something to walk around with that stays closed [(]zippered[)] up in your hand, briefcase or pack, they are fine. But what I like so much about the Galco “Hidden Agenda”, is that with its second compartment that contains a conventional calendar and notepad, you can open it, work from it, write in it, and not only still hide the gun, but actually further increase the illusion that you are unarmed [(]while at the same time, making the handgun you possess, even more readily available than it would be in most of the other designs[)]. As much of my work revolves around law-enforcing applications, this approach has numerous advantages but even in civilian uses, it gives you something more than just a “gun rug” [(]traditional zippered gun case[)] in which to carry and conceal your firearm “off the body”. It gives you something all of the items I discussed in the article are supposed to have: good but not gimmicky functionality in regard to hiding the gun in plain sight. It looks exactly like something else and yet it does exactly what you need, both safely and discretely. Use the Galco link that's found further along in the article and then either formally open or just pull down the Drop-Down Menu on their Homepage that is accessible through the “Holsters & Ammo Carriers” button at the top of that Homepage. Either way, when it opens, click on the “Specialty Holsters” category and when you get there, click on the “Hidden Agenda” image/link. It opens up to a very detailed page about the device, which itself offers up to two separate groups of photos that illustrate its dual function [(]that of both planner and gun carrier[)]. Hope this helps and I also hope you enjoyed the article. Tom Marx]]></comment_content>

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.laserlyte.com" target="_blank">LaserLyte</a> has added another training tool to its innovative collection with the introduction of the new Trainer Target Plinking Can.



White hit with a laser from any of the LaserLyte training cartridges or other laser trainer tools, the new cans react by jumping up and falling over-just as a real can would. The cans are powered by a 9V battery (which is included) and a spring loaded plunger released by a solenoid.



Each set is sold in a three-pack with three 9V batteries. LaserLyte estimates that each battery will tip the can over about 8,000 times.



<strong>Technical Specifications:</strong>



<strong>Weight:</strong> 4.25 ozs.

<strong>Length:</strong> 3.82"

<strong>Diameter:</strong> 2.00"

<strong>Battery:</strong> 9V

<strong>Battery Life:</strong> 8,000 Tip Overs

<strong>MSRP:</strong> $104.95

    <title>Redring for Home Defense?</title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=26256</link>

      <![CDATA[Designed primarily for clay shooters and hunters, testing by <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/redring-shotgun-sight-review" target="_blank">AmericanRifleman.org</a> in December determined the <a href="http://www.redringsight.com/product.aspx" target="_blank">Redring</a> shotgun sight can be a valuable asset on some clay stations and provides novice shooters a visual indication of their shot pattern at distance. I’ve seen turkeys taken with it, too, so it’s reliable afield. But, is it a viable home-defense optic?



Let’s face facts. Many people who use a shotgun as their primary home-defense firearm can’t afford to own two, and after a long day at the range it’s easy to forget to remove it from your shotgun. But, ghost-ring sights are fast, period. If you haven’t had the pleasure of crawling behind a set from <a href="http://www.xssights.com/index.php?nID=sights&amp;cID=Sights&amp;pID=sights&amp;sID=shotgun" target="_blank">XS Sight Systems</a>, you owe it to yourself to do so. The big, glowing red ring in the Redring struck me as being somewhat similar, so I rigged it up on my old Winchester Model 1400 Mk II.



It mounted fast, coming with enough adapters to secure onto any shotgun with rib widths of between 5 mm and 11.5 mm. Activation is a self-defense drawback, though. Both manual-brightness-adjustment buttons (located on the right side) must be depressed simultaneously and held down until the red ring appears. Then you release the buttons and the ring blinks furiously for a split second, at full output. The rate of blinking reflects battery power, but in a dark room the brightness was dazzling. In addition, I don’t have huge hands, so I couldn’t just wrap around the fore-end to turn it on. I had to release my off hand and reach over the sight. Odds are good I could defeat the problem with enough practice.



Once activated, the automatic brightness adjustment worked flawlessly and instantly, whether swung through dark closets or toward bright lights. There was no perceptible delay and the advantages are obvious when you include the use of today’s blinding tactical flashlights.



The sensor that samples downrange light is recessed almost ½ inch in a cylindrical hole with a .272-inch-diameter at the lower left of the front housing. The aluminum body gives it the sturdiness required for self-defense, while a black anodized finish gives it the looks, and standing slightly more than 1.3 inch above the rib, it certainly has the stature.



The holographic ring is projected onto a 1.4-inch by 1-inch glass surface that-due to the bottom of the Redring’s housing-winds up .17 inch above the rib. On my stock 1400, I had to move my cheek weld up to see the front brass bead, and with the delay in activating the unit I’m pretty sure I’ll be relying on that old front sight if the unthinkable happens fast. It isn’t terminal in regard to self-defense, but unless you have a high front sight don’t expect things to co-witness easily.



The Redring’s reticle, according to the manual, is 60 centimeters in diameter at 20 meters-roughly 24 inches at 65 feet. That rules out precision slug work, but at self-defense distances with buckshot it’s still MOA of bad guy.



Rarely mentioned is the ability to register your Redring and download a program that allows you to customize some of its functions. A USB cable (provided) attaches it to your computer to make changes. The Redring’s connection port is inside its AAAA battery compartment.



For obvious reasons, the Redring is more at home at the range. It’s not ideal for self-defense, nor was it meant to me. But, when a homeowner bunkers down in a safe room awaiting the arrival of authorities there should be time to activate the unit. And, with a high front sight, you can still rest easy after a day of clays, even if you forget  to loosen that pair of Allen bolts.]]>

      <![CDATA[Smaller incarnations of full-size guns aren’t necessarily a recent phenomenon-nor are full-size models that have been chambered in substantially smaller calibers. Rimfire versions of service revolvers and semi-automatics have always been popular for training and plinking purposes, and conversion kits have made it easy for target shooters to turn select models into .22 caliber pistols with relative ease. <a href="http://www.browning.com" target="_blank">Browning</a> took the concept to a different level, though, with the release of its miniaturized 1911-22.



Approximately 85 percent the size of a standard M1911A1, the .22 Long Rifle blowback 1911-22 emulates the lines of its parent model. Made entirely in the United States, the little pistol’s slide and frame are constructed from aircraft-grade T6 aluminum alloy, which is both durable and keeps the gun’s weight down to an even one pound. For added strength and proper function, the slide is fitted with a steel block that encloses the firing pin and extractor.



Because the gun is a blowback, the barrel is rigidly secured to the frame by a slide stop pin-but, aside from that and the obligatory changes to the magazine, the 1911-22 incorporates nearly all of the features of the famous .45 ACP original, including the 17.5-degree grip angle.



To learn more about the Browning 1911-22 check out the video below, hosted by Associate Online Editor <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article_list_tag.php?tag_id=1591" target="_blank">Shawn Skipper</a>.

    <title>NRA Outdoors Partners With Willie Bloomquist For Children&#039;s Charity</title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=26413</link>

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.nraoutdoors.com/" target="_blank">NRA Outdoors</a> recently partnered with Major League Baseball player Willie Bloomquist to raise money for the athlete's Abe and Max Fund, which is dedicated to assisting critically ill children. Together, Bloomquist and NRA Outdoors managed to raise $11,000 at the organization's inaugural hunting event.



The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AbeAndMaxFund" target="_blank">Abe and Max Fund</a>, founded by Bloomquist and his wife, Lisa, raises money to buy electronics for patients in the Phoenix Children's Hospital. Its goal is to provide the young patients with entertainment and a distraction while they're in the hospital receiving treatment.



The event was a two-day Texas hog hunt, attended entirely by NRA members and hosted by one of NRA Outdoors' top Texas outfitters. The event also featured an auction, which included sports memorabilia, on-field experiences and VIP ticket packages to Arizona Diamondbacks home games and a <a href="http://www.weatherby.com" target="_blank">Weatherby</a> Hog Reaper rifle topped with a <a href="http://www.leupold.com" target="_blank">Leupold</a> scope, which Bloomquist used during the trip to take a 300-pound hog.



"The folks in the outdoor industry, the people who like to hunt and fish are my kind of people: good, down-to-earth folks," Bloomquist said. "And they tend to be over-the-top generous when it comes to helping whenever there's a need and this is just another example of that generosity."



Bloomquist had asked NRA Outdoors to locate an outfitter that would provide both a top-of-the-line hunt and unparalleled service and professionalism. NRA Outdoors President Greg Ray was happy to oblige.



"Willie and I were introduced by a mutual friend in the outdoor industry who had utilized our services before and who knew we could help the Abe and Max Fund stage a fundraiser that would be different from the typical celebrity golf scramble," Ray said. "We have a lot of experience helping corporate clients arrange hunts and fishing trips for large groups and we're lucky to have a truly top-shelf hunting outfitter in Texas who has - among many things - a wealth of trophy-sized hogs. We felt it was a great match for the event and are pleased with the results and the feedback from those who attended."

      <![CDATA[This gun quotes thing is turning into a lot of fun and many readers are beginning to make solid contributions to the ongoing exchange. I pulled this one off the internet and it is a great piece of understatement:



“When a guy is swinging a crowbar at your head, it defines the nature of the relationship.”



Indeed-and that sort of implies that you may respond in kind. Also, after I discussed the ins and outs of choosing a gun for use in a car, I made my case for choosing an overwhelmingly powerful DA revolver. Reader BigFoot made an agreeing comment and concluded with this little gem:



“I assume that’s because he would rather end hostilities quickly as opposed to getting involved in a war of attrition between two girly guns.”



Verily, BigFoot.]]>

      <![CDATA[As we crowd the malls and shopping centers in search of the perfect gifts for loved ones, safety should never be too far out of mind. Overall, malls of are quite safe, but incidents can and do happen, and it’s best to have plan developed before heading out to catch sales, eat Cinnabuns and visit department-store santas, especially if you’re in a group that includes children.



To start, make sure everyone is carrying a cell phone. Its usefulness as a safety tool is unparalleled as it can be used to report suspicious people or packages, provide photos of children that stray and quickly gather a group if separated. At the same time, however, every group should have a predetermined gathering point in case of dead batteries, lost phones or if someone doesn’t own (yikes) a mobile device. The location can be a favorite restaurant or store, or entrance nearest the conveyances that brought you to the melee. It might even be beneficial to list multiple locations in the event of danger. These can be listed as location one and location two and texted to all parties, or simply as the main location if nothing is happening and alternate location in case of danger.



Second, all children should carry something, be it a card, chain, dog tags, etc., that lists name and at least two contact numbers in case of becoming lost. I recommend having at least one number for someone not in attendance on the shopping trip. This really does help police and security quickly return “our precious,” severely limiting the amount time that the heart chokes off oxygen intake. You should also discuss with your children that if they do become lost to find a police or security officer to help. You can also point out the information counters that many shopping centers situate conveniently for the benefit of customers.



Finally, everyone should have at least a basic idea of what to do in case of an extreme situation. Remind them that in most cases it’s best to hide in the back of stores, locked backrooms if possible, and wait for the police to handle the problem. Few citizens can actually provide help and the main job is to stay safe. Also, talk to kids, especially younger kids, about what to do if someone tries to steal them away. With witnesses everywhere, they should hit, kick and bite, making a point to scream out that “this is not my” mommy or daddy. Sure, most of us notice screaming kids wherever we go, but are you sure it’s not just a kid throwing a fit? Throwing in that phrase eliminates doubt.



Remember, situations can happen quickly, and there are numerous factors that can determine success, but a quote attributed to Louis Pasteur sums it up nicely. “Chance favors the prepared mind.”]]>

      <![CDATA[Two teens began knocking on the back door of a house where a 43-year-old woman was home alone. The woman grabbed her .38 revolver when the teens began to kick in the door. They reportedly entered her kitchen and charged toward her. The resident fired a single shot and one intruder fell to the floor before they both fled through the back door. Later a juvenile showed up at a local hospital with a gunshot wound to the arm. Both teens were arrested and charged with burglary. (<a href="http://www.daytondailynews.com/" target="_blank"><em>Dayton Daily News</em></a>, Dayton, OH, 6/26/13)



When a couple in Florida witnessed a group of robbers attempting to break into their home they acted quickly. The wife alerted her husband, who armed himself. The robbers ran, and knowing the local laws the husband simply shot at the ground to alert his neighbors of the fleeing intruders. A neighbor heard the shot, and the 44-year-old woman who happened to be a former professional boxer, tackled one of the men. Police later apprehended the other two suspects miles from the scene, and another two in the woods shortly after. All of the defendants were charged with burglary and theft, according to WESH-TV.

      <![CDATA[Gun folks are finicky. Don’t take my word for it, consider the following topics guaranteed to stir range debate: 1911 vs. polymer; 9 mm vs. .45 ACP; striker fired vs. hammer; bolt-action vs. semi-auto; mil vs. MOA; fiber optic vs. tritium; odd or even groove count; blued, stainless, anodized or parkerized; gas impingement vs. piston; and who really put the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXmsLe8t_gg" target="_blank">ram in the rama lama ding dong</a>.



Those strong opinions carry over into the gear they use. If your gift comes down squarely on the wrong side of the fence-and almost no shooters sit on a fence-it will collect dust in a closet until the family’s annual yard sale.



Take heart, though, the answer is easier than figuring out the lyrics to Barry Mann’s tune. Guns need cleaning. And, if you pick an easily transported range-bag system, it won’t be eyed with contempt like great aunt May’s annual soap-on-a-rope package.



KleenBore has some awesome complete kits designed for shooting-bag storage, but my favorite is the <a href="http://www.kleen-bore.com/products/cleaning-kits/pull-through-kits" target="_blank">CPT-U Universal</a>. It comes with Break-Free CLP, brushes, mops, cleaning cable, patches and stores in its zippered, molded-nylon 4x6x2-inch case. It works for most handguns, rifles and shotguns, and mine is currently on duty with an ROTC cadet. Having all of the gear together in one easily deployed unit is a big advantage, according to him. Any shooter on your list will appreciate the same convenience.



If they have an AR, consider <a href="http://www.gunslick.com/products/cleaningkits/ar-rifle-pull-thru-cleaning-kits.aspx" target="_blank">Gunslick Pro AR-Rifle Pull-Thru Cleaning Kits</a>. They come with cable, jags, patches, chamber guide, scraper, rod, brushes and Ultra-Care solution and two kits are available-.308 Win. and .223 Rem. The gear stores neatly in a zippered-nylon pouch that keeps those small items from disappearing.



Perhaps the person on  your list is a harder case to crack, so to speak. If so, consider the <a href="http://www.mpro7.com/m-pro7-advanced-small-arms-cleaning-kit.html" target="_blank">M-Pro 7 Advanced Small Arms Cleaning Kit</a>. It comes with all the essential cleaning gear for 5.56 mm, 7.62 NATO and 9 mm firearms, but is available in a hard-sided polymer case. A molle-attachable nylon version seeing use in combat is also available. If it’s good enough for those on the front line of freedom, it’s sure to put a smile on your recreational marksman’s face.



Perhaps nothing here caught your fancy. If so, take a look at AmericanRifleman.org’s holiday <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/galleries/2013-holiday-gift-guide" target="_blank">buying guide</a>. There are many good ideas there. But, guns need cleaning and that takes supplies-which makes any of these a good choice for that hard-to-buy-for person on  your list. So sit back, toss down a <a href="http://www.thortacticalenergy.com/" target="_blank">THOR Tactical Energy</a> drink, and enjoy the “dip da dip da dips” of last-minute-buying panic.]]>

      <![CDATA[For the first time since 1928, <a href="http://www.shopremingtoncountry.com" target="_blank">Remington</a> has released an air rifle-and the company is kicking off its launch with a holiday rebate, to boot. The new Remington Express Air Rifle, which is modeled after the iconic Model 700, is here, and will be available at a discounted rate of $149 this holiday season.



The spring-piston break-barrel action Remington Express .177 Caliber Air Rifle features a tapered, extended rifled barrel, full-length checkered real hardwood stock designed after the Model 700, a fitted rubber recoil pad, 4x32mm scope and mounts and traditional 3/8-inch Dovetail, allowing the option to fit a suitable picatinny rail.



With its 1,000-fps performance, the Express is intended for target shooting and small vermin. It's equipped with a two-stage precision trigger, auto/reset safety, fiber optic front sight and fiber optic adjustable rear sight. The whole package measures out to 45.5-inches long, and weighs in at 8.3 pounds.



Express Air Rifles purchased from <a href="http://www.shopremingtoncountry.com" target="_blank">ShopRemingtonCountry.com</a> before Dec. 19 will receive free shipping, and also come with a pair of free gifts: a Sportsman Series Insignia Edition Knife, and the consumer's choice of any of the nine Rem Wrap Camo Patterns available for the rifle.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Nice Shotgun, But Ruger made them cheaper than they do now, also that automatic safety is a real pain in the rear when shooting trap, skeet or sporting clays. It should be an option. Anyway, I always liked this gun, but Ruger should make it in 20, 28 and .410. Sales would definitely go up bring down the price to just over a grand.

      <![CDATA[In 2011, <a href="http://www.ruger.com" target="_blank">Ruger</a> halted production of the highly popular Red Label shotgun. Recently, the company announced a redesigned Red Label featuring refined inner workings, a new center of gravity and reduced recoil.



The new 12-gauge Red Label has a redistributed center of gravity for improved instinctual swing and pointing. It also features 2-inch extended forcing cones, maximum back-bored barrels and a soft Pachmayr buttpad to reduce recoil.



The Red Label comes with an American Walnut stock with a 1.5-inch drop at comb and a 2.5-inch drop at heel. Red Label shotguns are available with 26-, 28- or 30-inch barrels and each model features a 14.5-inch length of pull.



To learn more about the Ruger Red Label check out the video below, hosted by <em>American Rifleman</em> Editor-in-Chief <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article_list_author.php?id=16" target="_blank">Mark Keefe</a>.



<strong>Technical Specifications:</strong>



<strong>Caliber:</strong> 12 Gauge

<strong>Chamber:</strong> 3"

<strong>Barrel:</strong> 26", 28", 30"

<strong>Overall Length:</strong> 43", 45", 47"

<strong>Sights:</strong> Brass Bead Front

<strong>Weight:</strong> 7.5 lbs. to 7.9 lbs.

<strong>Length of Pull:</strong> 14."

<strong>Stock:</strong> American Walnut

<strong>MSRP:</strong> $1,399

      <![CDATA[If you’ve ever wondered what it would be like to be an armorer-or more specifically the NRA Publications' armorer-you came to the right place. NRA Publications is your first-hand source for the latest and greatest industry offerings. As the division armorer, it is <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_7218.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-26502" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="IMG_7218" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_7218-188x300.jpg" alt="" width="188" height="300" /></a>my duty to maintain our inventory of firearms, optics and gear. Every firearm that you see reviewed in print and online first passes through my office, so it is my privilege to give you a sneak peek even before an editor gets his hands on it. This is My Job…



My day usually starts fairly early-65 miles away I begin the journey into the abyss of one million gas-guzzling crazed rats looking for their slice of cheese. Fortunately upon arrival at NRA Headquarters, my slice starts off with a trip to the “Vault” and a confused stare into the darkness as I gather my rat-race thoughts and feel for the light switch. I am sure most of you are pondering, “What’s in the vault?” Well, maybe one of these days I’ll be permitted to take you there. But for now, I will just close the door and head up to my office with the “cart” and how could I forget…<em>guns</em>.



Guns and gear aren’t the only things on my cheese platter-my job includes managing our Tech Range, Tech Shop, Office Shop, Dope Bag reviews, assisting Mark Keefe with American Rifleman TV, and list goes on and on. I know-your patience is dwindling and you want to see some guns, scopes (and, of course, Mark’s good looks), but for now I will have to draw this to a close and get back to work. The photo lab is looking for a feature gun for February’s issue of <em>American Rifleman</em>. Stay tuned to “This Is My Job” and we will pick up where I left off…]]>

      <![CDATA[<em>This article first appeared in <a href="http://www.secondcalldefense.org/self-defense-news" target="_blank">Self-Defense News</a> at <a href="http://www.secondcalldefense.org/" target="_blank">Second Call Defense</a>.</em>



The holidays are a very busy time of year, and often mean long road trips to visit family and friends.If you'll be hitting the road soon, follow these tips to be prepared and stay safe.



<strong>Plan your trip.</strong>

Having a GPS can make you lazy about planning. Always bring a "real" map just in case and have a list of addresses and phone numbers for your destinations.



<strong>Give your vehicle a once-over.</strong>

This includes checking the basics, including tire pressure, oil, steering fluid, brake fluid, wiper fluid, engine coolant, lights, and battery. It's not a bad idea to get an oil change before your trip, which often includes a multi-point inspection.



<strong>Check your emergency gear.</strong>

Make sure your spare tire is properly inflated. Also make sure you have a jack and lug wrench to change a tire. Other handy items include a flashlight with fresh batteries, flares, jumper cables, tire chains and a tire inflater, either the quick fix kind in a can or one that is powered by your cigarette lighter.



<strong>Prepare for bad weather.</strong>

If you break down on the road, you'll want to at least have boots and warm clothing. Additional items that could make you and your family more comfortable as you do repairs or wait for a tow truck include blankets, hand warmers and a small supply of food and drinks.



<strong>Charge your cell phone.</strong>

Ask the rest of your family to charge their phones as well. And make sure you bring a charger. This is your lifeline if you get stuck or have an accident.



<strong>Bring a credit card and spare cash.</strong>

If you have a breakdown or need a tow, you'll need a credit card to pay for it since these services can get pretty expensive. And it's always good to have cash just in case you can't use your card for any reason. If you're a member of an auto club, bring that card too.



<strong>Plan for carrying, transporting and storing your firearm.</strong>

Check the rules for each state you'll travel through. And think about how you'll carry or store your gun at your destination.



Think extra hard about safety if there will be children around because when you're passed out on the couch from all the food, they could be darting all over the house. Don't assume you're clever enough to "hide" your firearm. Kids are way better at finding things than you are at hiding them.]]>

    <title>Meopta Launches MeoStar R2 Riflescope Series</title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=26599</link>

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.meoptausa.com" target="_blank">Meopta</a> has introduced its latest generation of MeoStar riflescopes with the new R2 series, starting with the 30mm MeoStar 1-6x24 RD. The new model is not only the first of its line, but also Meopta's first riflescope with a 6x zoom ratio.



With a true 1x magnification, wide field of view, edge-to-edge clarity and illuminated reticle options of either the K-Dot 2 or 4C-RD, the  MeoStar 1-6x24 RD allows for extremely fast and accurate target acquisition. The versatile R2 is also designed to be excellent for close-quarter situations on an AR platform, and much longer shots depending on the caliber being used and the shooter's proficiency.



Meopta engineers have also created a brand-new illumination system for the R2 series which is visible even in the brightest of daylight. This new RD8 illumination system has eight levels of reticle intensity so the brightness level of the red dot can be adjusted to accommodate the ever-changing light and weather conditions in the field - from the brightest sunshine and snow to the dimmest light.



Like all Meopta riflescopes, the MeoStar R2 riflescope is machined from a solid block of aircraft-grade aluminum alloy and built to withstand extreme conditions. The scope features an anodized exterior for scratch resistance and is waterproof, shockproof and fogproof for maximum performance and durability.



The initial R2 will be available in two reticle options-the K-Dot 2 or the 4C-RD-and will ship with an MSRP of $1,595.

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.crimsontrace.com" target="_blank">Crimson Trace</a> has announced the introduction of two new green Lasergrip models that have been crafted with the 1911 fan in mind. Just like the company's popular red Lasergrips, the new green models (LG-401G and LG-404G) are durable, easy to install and simple to operate.



Featuring Crimson Trace's patented Instinctive Activation, the LG-401G is designed to deliver top-of-its-class engineering, and is one of the smallest green lasers available for firearms on the market. The unit's precision design offers a seamless fit to full-size 1911 frames to ensure that a "from-the-factory" appearance.



The LG-404G, meanwhile, was crafted with compact 1911 handguns in mind. It also features Instinctive Activation.



The appeal of laser sights with green diodes has grown in recent years among gun owners and self-defense enthusiasts because the technology is easier to perceive for more shooter's eyes during intense lighting.



Crimson Trace's new green Lasergrips should be available on dealer shelves now. They ship with an MSRP of $399.

      <![CDATA[All too often, experienced shooters get caught up in the intricacies of their sport and forget what got them started in the first place. They forget that what originally attracted them to shooting is that it is fun. Lost in their memories are the pleasant hours spent busting tin cans and learning the very basics of marksmanship. Fortunately, from time to time, a gun comes along as a reminder of those happy, by-gone days. The Ruger New Bearcat Shopkeeper is one such gun.



Ruger originally introduced the Bearcat revolver in 1958, and it quickly became a popular handgun for campers, fishermen and plinkers. Because of its diminutive size, it also became a popular “first” gun for youngsters who were just getting started shooting. In the mid-1970s, Ruger transitioned all of its single-action revolvers to a transfer-bar safety and, at the same time, the Bearcat was discontinued. However, the popularity of this little six-gun just wouldn’t let it die and, in 1993, Ruger reintroduced the Bearcat, this time with a transfer-bar safety. The latest iteration of the Ruger New Bearcat is the Shopkeeper as commissioned by Lipsey’s, a major Ruger distributor.



The New Bearcat Shopkeeper is similar to all other Bearcats in that it is a .22 Long Rifle caliber, six-shot, single-action revolver with wood stocks and fixed sights. However, that is about where the similarity begins to fade. Instead of the traditional 4-inch barrel, the Shopkeeper sports a 3-inch version with 1:16-inch rifling. The most readily apparent difference in the two guns is the Shopkeeper’s birdshead grip frame. Manufactured entirely of stainless steel, the Shopkeeper even sports a stainless steel ejector-rod housing that matches the appearance of the rest of the gun.



Not as readily apparent, but just as important, are some changes to the revolver’s ejection system. In order to accommodate the shortened barrel and ejector rod, a button-head cylinder pin is installed on the Shopkeeper along with a crescent-shaped thumb piece on the ejector rod. They allow the ejector rod to make a longer stroke that will more reliably punch the empty cases out of the cylinder.



The test sample Ruger Bearcat Shopkeeper weighed in at 23 ounces, with an overall length of 7.5 inches. The trigger broke cleanly at a pull weight of 3 pounds, 9 ounces. Stocks were a reddish brown laminated wood with silver Ruger medallions.



Even with the transfer-bar safety, the Bearcat Shopkeeper is loaded and disassembled in the manner of old model single-actions. To allow the cylinder to rotate, the hammer is placed on half-cock. When that is done, the cylinder is lined up with the loading gate so that cartridges may be loaded into each chamber or spent cartridges ejected. At that point, the cylinder may also be removed by depressing the cylinder-release pin, in the front of the frame, and pulling the cylinder pin forward out of the frame.



In testing the Shopkeeper, three different .22 Long Rifle loads were used. They were the 40-grain CCI Mini-Mag hollow-point, the Remington 40-grain High-Velocity hollow-point, and the Winchester 40-grain Power-Point. Accuracy testing was conducted at 7 yards using sandbags for a rest. Five consecutive, five-shot groups were shot with each load, and the Ruger Bearcat Shopkeeper posted acceptable groups for this type of handgun. All three loads also shot to point-of-aim. The Winchester Power-Point edged the other two out by averaging 3.03-inch groups.



Subjectively, the New Bearcat Shopkeeper was found to be a very comfortable revolver to shoot. The birdshead grip fit quite nicely into the shooting hand. And, probably due to the fact that the ejector-rod housing was stainless steel instead of an alloy, the revolver had a slight muzzle-heaviness that made it point very quickly and naturally. The stainless steel sights, which do not give the best sight picture, especially in bright sunlight, were balanced by the clean-breaking trigger.



The New Bearcat Shopkeeper lends itself to informal plinking and target practice. In <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/bearcat1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-26608" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="bearcat" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/bearcat1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="276" /></a>addition, it is nearly perfect for slipping into a pants pocket during a leisurely jaunt in the woods, or while enjoying a day at the fishing hole, for use against poisonous snakes. With that in mind, however, one can’t help but wish for the Shopkeeper in a .22 WMR chambering.



Regardless, it is one of those guns that, once a fellow picks it up, it is hard to put down. It just feels right.



As mentioned earlier, the Ruger New Bearcat Shopkeeper was commissioned by Lipsey’s and, therefore, is only available through a retail store that deals with that company. If a local gun shop doesn’t order from Lipsey’s, visit the Lipsey’s website at lipseys.com to find the closest retailer that does.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I was very excited by this neat little revolver, until the author mentioned a 3' group with the best ammunition at 7 yards OFF OF SANDBAGS.  And then called the groups acceptable for 'this type of gun.'  So a single action revolver with a nice trigger in 22lr can only be expected to be a 43moa gun?  That's ridiculous.  I've shot a s&w kit gun at 100 yards and gotten less than a 12 inch group.  Offhand.  I hope this review is not indicative of the accuracy potential of this revolver, but if it is, not interested... ]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[In response to Greg Onley; you need to read the article a bit more carefully. The accuracy is in the 3 inch range at 7 yards  NOT 3 feet. I also have .22s which shoot more accurately, but they all have better sights and longer barrels also. I do not consider the Bearcat Shopkeeper in the same class of revolver as the S&W Kit.
To NRA Staff; I'm not sure I would spend this much money on a .22, but I enjoyed the review.]]>

      <![CDATA[Two years ago, shooting alongside veteran Marine sniper Steve Reichert, I thought I’d accomplished something: Using handwritten ballistic data cards, I scored first-round hits on steel targets across a wooded valley at 1,000 and 1,400 yards. Despite his fancy handheld ballistic computer, Reichert missed both targets. Unperturbed, he punched two corrections into his Trimble Nomad computer and from then on, during several days of shooting, never missed-that is to say he didn’t miss another target at any distance. I knew, then, it was time to take a closer look at today’s advanced ballistic software.



Unlike a desktop computer ballistic program that generates drop, wind drift and time-of-flight tables, modern ballistic software incorporates all the shooter’s specifics-rifle, barrel length, twist-rate, scope details, ammunition details, etc.-and then, based upon the target (distance, angle up or down, moving or stationary) and the atmospherics (altitude, temperature, barometric pressure, wind direction and speed) it calculates the exact elevation and windage settings for a direct hit.



Such precision is unattainable with handwritten cards or manual calculations. For example, most shooters equate one minute of angle (m.o.a.) to 1.047" at 100 yards; however, some of today’s software uses the more exact 1.047197580733" and similar precision for many other factors. Shooting less than 500 yards, many shooters don’t need such computational assistance; beyond 500 yards, it becomes very useful; beyond 1,000 yards. it dramatically increases the likelihood of a hit.



<strong>Field Firing Solutions</strong>

The first program I examined was “Field Firing Solutions, Version Delta V,” loaded in a field-rugged Trimble Nomad handheld computer, the same as Steve Reichert used and with which he has fired his .338 Lapua Mag. rifle accurately to 2000 yards. Everything about the software demands and yields precision. Instead of lasing 100 yards for my initial zero, I was instructed to tape-measure it-remember, a laser is accurate “only” to within one yard. And I was required to measure not from my muzzle but from my scope’s elevation knob, the exact spot where a shooter applies elevation and windage changes.



Elevation knobs are inherently inconsistent, I learned-which is what inspired the software developer, Blaine Fields. Back in 2002 he had problems matching his new scope’s Bullet Drop Compensator to his rifle’s trajectory. Devising a simple computer program, he found that instead of the knob rotating 1/2 m.o.a. per click, it was actually 0.489 m.o.a. After solving that discrepancy he just kept going. “The program just took on a life of its own,” he explained. Following his procedures, I determined my scope’s precise click-value.



The Field Firing Solutions software contains a bullet database of nearly 3,500 entries, with room to enter custom loads, too. Many ballistic programs use only a bullet’s G1 Drag Model to produce a Ballistic Coefficient (BC), but Fields knew a bullet’s drag increases as it slows, lowering its BC, while today’s Very Low Drag bullets demand a low-drag G7 Model. Thus, his software employs multiple “stepped” Drag Models, which vary with bullet shape, length, weight and velocity at various distances.



Instead of entering the cartridge manufacturer’s muzzle velocity or measuring it with a chronograph-Field has found both slightly inaccurate-he had me test-fire at several distances, a process called “trueing”-to determine exactly how high or low my hit compared to the computer-generated point of aim. “The program will take this point of impact, compare it to the point of aim and then calculate a muzzle velocity which corresponds to that actual point of impact,” he explained. In one more step, I determined the velocity error factor and the software calculated the bullet’s BC. With that input, the software traced an updated trajectory that was “true,” reflecting my bullet’s precise arc, calibrating it to my scope’s click value.



Along with the corrected muzzle velocity and BC, I entered barrel length, twist-rate and direction of twist, and the exact height of the scope’s optical axis above the bore axis. All these details became a “profile” for that particular rifle, scope and cartridge, ready to be called up whenever needed. What if I wanted to profile another load or another rifle? According to Field, his program can store nearly 2 million such profiles.



It’s only when you reach a shooting location that you add more data, beginning with atmospherics. I obtained those from a Kestral 2500 electronic weather gauge-altitude, temperature, barometric pressure, humidity, station pressure, and wind direction and speed, entering it manually. The program can interpose three winds simultaneously, as well as consider vertical wind deflection from mountain updrafts and downdrafts. The atmospherics don’t usually change so long as a shooter stays at one location, but they can be updated at any time.



Now, add your target-its range, its angle uphill or downhill, whether it’s stationary or moving and to what degree. In a split-second the software calculates all winds, the atmospherics, range, up/down slant, target movement, spin drift (the tendency for a bullet to drift in the direction of its rifling), even the slight Coriolis effect caused by the earth’s rotation. The elevation and windage solution is offered as eighths, quarters or halves of one m.o.a., as 10ths of one mil, or as centimeters. To hasten engagement times, you can create a Target Range Card with a reference target for instantly shifting from one target’s firing solution to another.



“Field Firing Solutions is like having a very knowledgeable coach looking over your shoulder to answer questions,” says retired Phoenix SWAT officer Giles Stock, a 32-year instructor at Arizona’s Gunsite Academy and one of America’s most knowledgeable tactical rifle authorities. He has taken the system a step further, using his Trimble Nomad’s Bluetooth feature to automatically monitor and update atmospherics from a Kestral 4500 weather gauge, and to instantly input target data from Vector laser-ranging binoculars. It’s an incredible capability. Using the setup, he’s had rifle students score first-round hits to 2,200 yards. Marine sniper Reichert regularly does the same to well over a mile. Field Firing Solutions software is used by some of the world’s most elite special operations units as well as American police SWAT teams.



Instead of dialing computer-driven solutions on target knobs, some shooters employ riflescopes with a Horus reticle, a uniform grid that takes mil-dots to the next level. Arrayed as precise 1/5th mil aiming lines and dots, a Horus reticle appears confusingly busy-until you understand it. After that, you simply aim with the dot indicated by the ballistic software, never lifting your head away from the scope or rotating knobs. The combination of software and reticle make shooting multiple targets remarkably fast and impressively accurate.



<strong>Horus ATRAG Software</strong>

Horus also offers its own advanced ballistic software, ATRAG, the second program I explored. I was introduced to ATRAG this year while training with 101st Airborne Division snipers at Ft. Campbell, Ky., just before they deployed to Afghanistan. According to Brian Mellado of Horus Vision, the company won a U.S. Army contract for 2,700 Advanced Ballistic Calculator kits containing ATRAG software in a sturdy Trimble Recon handheld computer.



Snipers of the 101st Airborne’s 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry, have trained extensively with <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Kestral-wind-Portland.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-26623" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="Sierra Exif JPEG" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Kestral-wind-Portland.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="287" /></a>ATRAG’s MX military version and are now using it daily in combat. Having already used Field Firing Solutions, I could appreciate the importance of ATRAG’s similar “trueing” of the trajectory curve-and concluded that ballistic software must include “trueing” to achieve accuracy. ATRAG operates a great deal like Field Firing Solutions but for a number of nuanced differences; for instance, ATRAG does not consider a bullet’s length, which can affect spin drift calculations. Also, ATRAG employs the “clock” system for entering wind direction, while Field Firing Solutions uses exact degrees.



The “Screaming Eagle” snipers use ATRAG calculations both as knob settings and as Horus reticle holds, depending on the situation. “There is a time and place for both dialing and holding,” explained the platoon’s senior sniper, “but we greatly prefer using holds with the Horus reticle. In a kinetic [shooting] environment that requires rapid engagements, the Horus reticle provides a great platform for not only first-round hits but for fast follow-on shots and corrections.”



When they occupy a final firing position, the 101st Airborne snipers input local atmospherics and likely target locations, then jot down multiple firing solutions so they’re ready to engage when enemy forces appear. For quick reference, they post this data on a wristband display like NFL quarterbacks use. “While emplaced on a COP [Combat Outpost] in Afghanistan,” one sniper recently emailed me, “we observed a target with an RPG [rocket launcher] pop up on a wall approximately 1,000 meters away. The enemy fired the RPG at our bunker and jumped back down … . A few seconds later the target <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Horus-H58.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-26630" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="Horus H58" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Horus-H58-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>reappeared and began running down the wall. When he got to the end, my spotter was able to use a laser rangefinder to determine the distance-960 meters. After referencing my wristband for the correct dope, which was 9.4 mils elevation, I held 0.5 mils left for wind and engaged, resulting in a first-round hit. The entire event took no longer than 45 seconds and we would not have had enough time to engage if we would have had to dial [knobs] as the target only exposed himself for a short period each time.”



In addition to the U.S. Army’s ATRAG system, earlier this year Kestral released a new weather gauge that incorporates ATRAG ballistic software. Extremely lightweight and compact, the Kestral 4500NV integrates the ATRAG program with full atmospherics that are continuously updated. The title’s “NV” stands for “night vision” because the unit has special backlighting for use with night vision goggles.



I spent three months trying out the Kestral unit and its ATRAG software, finding it as accurate and user-friendly as the original version, and offering amazing capability in a very small package.



<strong>Ballistic AE Software</strong>

Another program that impressed me was “Ballistic AE,” an application for Apple iOS devices which include the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. This software’s many features include the ability to “true” a bullet’s trajectory, much the same as the already mentioned programs. Ballistic AE’s database contains more than 4,000 factory loads and bullets, to which a shooter can add his own handloads.



Sergeant Mark Jacobson, a longtime SWAT sniper and friend, has used Ballistic AE for two years, finding it no more difficult to learn than a typical application but requiring practice. “I wouldn’t hesitate to use it on the job,” he told me, “but I’ve used it enough to know the software.” He has entered several rifles and 16 cartridge loads into his program.



An especially useful function-common to this and the previous software programs-is one step mil-ranging. If your scope has a mil-dot reticle, simply measure an object of known size in mils, repeat this on the program’s miniature mil-dot reticle and, presto, there’s the distance. All three softwares also incorporate an inclinometer for determining uphill/downhill target angles.



I use an electronic weather gauge, but if you don’t have one, iOS devices can tap into the <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ballistic.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-26636" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="ballistic" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ballistic-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>National Weather Service (weather.gov) for atmospheric data, while GeoNames.com offers altitude, latitude and longitude, provided you’re near a cell phone tower. Ballistic AE’s solutions appear as inches or centimeters or incremental clicks (1/8 minute, 1/4 minute, 1/2 minute or full minute), and mil increments (0.1 mil, 0.5 mil), which can be dialed on knobs or used to select a Horus reticle aiming point.



I’ve been using this program on an iPad Mini whose large screen-6"x4¾"-is easy to read and offers touch-activated controls. The downside? The iOS devices probably won’t stand up to tough field use.



But the program has proved acceptably accurate. Sergeant Jacobson reports that the first time he shot his .338 Lapua Mag. out to 1,000 yards using Ballistic AE, the solutions were within one m.o.a. at 700, 900 and 1,000 yards, but he had to adjust elevation for 800 yards.



If you have an Android Operating System phone or device, a program similar to Ballistic AE-“Bulletflight M”-is available from Knight’s Armament, which builds Stoner rifles and the U.S. Army’s M110 semi-automatic sniper rifle.



Bulletflight M is also available for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, and requires iOS 4.2 or later.



All this ballistic software has made me a believer. But despite such impressive capabilities, long-range shooting still requires accurate wind estimation and a skilled shooter to place the bullet. A rifle doesn’t shoot itself-at least not yet.]]>

      <![CDATA[CMMG has introduced its new Mk3 CBR, chambered in .308 Win./7.62x51mm NATO. Precision-built to deliver the functionality that the company is known for, the new carbine comes with another perk: It's a high-end rifle design that will be available to consumers as a more practical price.



The Mk3 CBR features the free float RKM15 KeyMod hand guard, which measures 15-inches in length to accommodate a wide range of hand positions. The feature allows operators to attach an assortment of different accessories, too. The KeyMod slots are located at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions with a 1913 Picatinny rail on top to give the hand guard an array of mounting options. The KeyMod system is a simple, comfortable and lightweight mounting solution that offers users a low profile alternative to the M1913 Picatinny rail.



The carbine is constructed with a hard anodized, billet 6061-T6 aluminum receiver. A 416 stainless barrel was selected and features a nitride finish that provides the barrel with long lasting accuracy and corrosion resistance.



Thanks to a pair of industry partnerships, the rifle will ship with a <a href="http://geissele.com/" target="_blank">Geissele Automatics</a> SSA 2-stage trigger, a <a href="http://magpul.com/" target="_blank">Magpul</a> ACS-L collapsible butt stock and Magpul MOE pistol grip. The rifle also comes with a Magpul 20 LR PMAG® with a 20 round capacity.

    <title>Unmistakable: The Thompson</title>

      <![CDATA[It is unlikely that any other firearm has captured the public imagination so thoroughly, both at the height of its era and continuing on long thereafter, as the Thompson Submachine Gun. Even today, more than 90 years after its introduction, the Thompson still dominates the iconography of the submachine gun. It is preeminent, impressive and an unmistakable figure of World War II American firepower.



Its role in Depression-era gangland violence made it infamous-despite the fact that it was intended for use “On The Side of Law and Order” and was more common in the hands of lawmen than criminals-and it earned defamatory nicknames including, “Chopper,” “Chicago Typewriter” and “Gangster Gun.” In 1926, Colliers described the Thompson as a “diabolical engine of death.” The negative publicity kept the Thompson from being viewed as an important military arm-until it was almost too late.



When the Thompson finally ended up in the hands of American Marines, sailors and soldiers, its reputation was already well established. In combat, the Thompson earned respect from all who fired it, and the gun instilled confidence in the men who carried it. My father, who carried a Thompson in Europe during World War II, once told me: “When the Krauts heard the blast of a Thompson, they either gave up or went away and bothered somebody else!”



As a submachine gun, it excelled at close range. In the Pacific, it blasted Japanese through the thick jungle underbrush. In Europe, it pounded Germans in hedgerows and in house-to-house actions. It was heavy, but it was robust and reliable. It was expensive to produce, but the G.I.’s confidence in the gun justified the investment.



Through the years, I have heard and read many stories and myths about the Thompson. One Thompson accessory quickly dismissed as “too heavy,” “too complicated” or “too noisy” is the 50-round drum magazine. The drum was thought to have been quickly phased out early in World War II. But my photographic research doesn’t support that notion. You will see numerous photos of Marines using 50-round drum magazines throughout the war (including on Okinawa, the last major island battle). Obviously, some Marines valued the extra firepower inherent in the drum, and it is proven through the photos.



The Thompson has a classic, distinctive appearance. It is a legend among firearms, and photos of the gun speak for themselves, much like the “Tommy Gun” itself did, in its own unmistakable way.]]>

    <title>Leupold Custom Shop Introduces MOA-based TS-32X1 Reticle</title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=26646</link>

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.leupold.com" target="_blank">Leupold</a> has introduced the new TS-32X1 reticle, a minute-of-angle (MOA) based system that's designed to allow for precision shots without the need for dial adjustments.



A heavy post and thin stadia crosshair features 1-MOA hashmarks on both the TS-32X1's horizontal and vertical lines. Every other hash mark on the horizontal stadia is slightly longer, providing quick and easy 2-MOA measurements. Every four MOA is indicated by a number.



Leupold has also set up the vertical stadia with 1-MOA tics and longer 2-MOA marks. Every fourth mark is numbered, all the way to the complete 32-MOA elevation range. Wind dots in the lower half of the reticle are spaced in 2 MOA increments, both vertically and horizontally. The system allows for immediate and precise holdovers and wind holds, as well as range estimation.



The TS-32X1 is the first in a family of MOA-based reticles that will cover several magnification ranges. It's currently available for the second focal place VX-3, VX-III, Vari-X II and Mark 4 4.5-14 LR/T riflescopes. Existing riflescopes can be retrofitted for $159.99 through the Leupold Custom Shop.



Adding the TS-32X1 to a new riflescope ordered through the company's Custom Shop will cost consumers $129.99.

      <![CDATA[Injuries sustained to Anthony Wilson's face, torso, arms and legs were severe, but he was last reported to be in good condition after he was attacked by two dogs in his neighborhood. The dogs escaped from a yard early one afternoon and attacked 77-year-old Wilson. He tried to seek refuge under a pickup truck with little success. The dogs snapped at his legs and continued to bite and claw him, trying to drag him from the protection of the vehicle. A neighbor heard Wilson's cries for help and responded quickly when he saw the dogs attacking. The neighbor retrieved a firearm and attempted to scare the dogs away. But when the dogs then turned their attention to the neighbor, he fired, killing both animals. (<a href="http://http://thetimes-tribune.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Times-Tribune</em></a>, Dunmore, PA, 7/3/13)



An intruder entered a Ville Platte home with a gun at around 1 a.m. Sunday, intending to rob the owners. The homeowner said her kids were in bed when the intruder entered the front door wearing a black ski mask. He walked to the back of the house and confronted a friend of the homeowner, putting a gun to his head and demanding money. The friend refused, according to the homeowner, and the intruder attempted to fire the gun but it jammed and a fight broke out. Local police found the intruder fatally wounded on the kitchen floor, apparently killed by his own handgun.

<strong>From The Armed Citizen Archives</strong>

<em>March 1972:</em> Walter Marley, 64, of Philadelphia, Pa., heard strange noises in a neighbor's unoccupied apartment and went, gun in hand, to investigate. He arrived as three burglars were leaving. When one resisted, Marley wounded two of them. (<em>The Philadelphia Inquirer</em>, Philadelphia, Pa.)]]>

      <![CDATA[Practicality in cartridge selection is a popular topic that is often preached more than it’s practiced. Practicality in rifle selection is less fashionable in conversation and in service. This is due in part to the vanity of hunters who like to have a cool or expensive rifle to show off around the campfire. It’s the same reason you could buy a Ford Mustang with a V6 instead of a 300 horsepower V8. High gas prices make the V6 more practical since the Mustang’s sexy lines would still turn heads on the way to the post office. Ford, however, sold a lot of V8 Mustangs.



From a practical standpoint a rifle should be completely reliable, provide suitable accuracy, long-term durability and ease of operation, for as little money as possible. If you look at big-game hunting rifles from that point of view, it would be hard not to see <a href="http://www.marlinfirearms.com/" target="_blank">Marlin’s</a> X7 line of bolt-actions.



The X7’s most notable feature is the Marlin designed Pro-Fire Trigger. In the center of the trigger there’s an actuator or release, which has come to be called a “passive safety.” This actuator prevents the rifle from firing unless it is pressed <em>with</em> the trigger. This is similar in function to the <a href="http://www.savagearms.com/" target="_blank">Savage</a> AccuTrigger and triggers on <a href="http://us.glock.com/" target="_blank">Glock</a> pistols. With the action removed from the stock, the trigger is easy to adjust for pull weight. Marlin claims the Pro-Fire Trigger is creep-free, though I could detect a minuscule amount of creep at the lowest weight setting. Even so, this is a great trigger for a factory rifle, especially when you consider many replacement triggers cost a third as much as the X7 rifle.



The X7’s injection molded, pillar-bedded, synthetic stock has a straight comb and cheek piece. The rifle has a two-position safety and a fluted bolt that is easy to remove and disassemble for cleaning. It is a push-feed design with a spring-loaded ejector and an extractor that slides at a 90-degree angle in a raceway cut into the bolt’s face. The head of the bolt is separate from the bolt body and attached by a robust pin. This permits the head to slightly flex, potentially compensating for alignment errors incurred during assembly and action torque when firing.



For testing the X7, I mounted a new 3.5-14x40 <a href="http://www.nikonsportoptics.com/en/index.page" target="_blank">Nikon</a> Pro-Staff riflescope with a BDC reticle. This brought the total rifle weight to 8 pounds, 2 ounces. The X7 comes with Weaver bases but will work with <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester</a> model 70 mounts. I fired five, five-shot groups from the bench with four different factory loads, cooling the barrel after every fifth shot. Average for all 20 groups was 1.755 inches. The smallest group measured 1.15 inches, the largest, 2.56 inches. The best single load average for five groups was just a shade less than 1.5 inches.



Problems with a rifle very often only surface in the field. How a hunting rifle performs and handles during off-hand shooting is even more important than how it shoots from a solid rest, at least for hunters. Feeding from the internal box magazine was flawless and it wasn’t necessary to insert a cartridge into the magazine before chambering. You could just toss a cartridge in the ejection port and close the bolt.



I worked with the rifle from various shooting positions, manipulating the bolt slow and fast and no issues were encountered. Starting with a loaded rifle and shooting from the standing off-hand position, I used a shot timer and fired several three-shot strings at a deer target 60 yards down range. Average time for three kill zone (6-inch circle) hits on the deer was about eight seconds. These times are consistent with similar rifles I have tested in the past.



There are five versions of the X7 available from Marlin, each is configured a bit differently and one of the five should appeal to you and the game you hunt. With the exception of the X7Y (Youth) and the X7VH (Varmint), all X7s are available in .243 Win., .25-06 Rem., .270 Win., 7 mm-08 Rem., .308 Win. and .30-06 Sprg. The X7Y is only available in .243, 7 mm-08 and .308 and the heavy barreled X7VH comes in only .22-250 Remington and .308.

About 10 different hunters use our camp each year and it’s not uncommon for one or more to experience rifle, scope or ammunition problems during the two-week buck season. I arrived at camp one year only to discover I’d left the bolt for my purely practical, but custom built, .257 Roberts at home. I hear stories every year about hunters getting to camp only to find they have a gun related issue of some sort. At that price, it makes sense to buy a <a title="View the Marlin X7 Gallery." href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/galleries/marlin-x7-images" target="_blank">Marlin X7</a> as a backup or camp gun for knuckleheads like me, or for anyone else that might need to use a really practical hunting rifle.



Marlin made its name building what are arguably the best lever-action rifles in the world. Marlin lever-action aficionados who would like to remain brand loyal, but would also like to have a bolt-action, have several X7s to choose from. For those folks and others who may not be loyal Marlin owners, one of the X7s should give you practically everything you are looking for in a hunting rifle and you’ll still have some cash left over for a scope.

    <title>Swarovski CL Companion 8X 30 mm Binocular</title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=26672</link>

      <![CDATA[Optics companies are secretive when it comes to the formulas for their lens coatings. We’ll never know the precise mix Austrian maker <a href="http://www.swarovskioptik.com/?gclid=CPazntPFqLsCFaHm7AodCXsAAw" target="_blank">Swarovski</a> puts into and onto the lens surfaces of its CL Companion 8X 30 mm binocular, but it is undeniably effective.

Although retired from service in 2006, the 1951 U.S. Air Force resolution chart provides a baseline for evaluating optical performance and clarity. From a sandbag rest the Swarovski was clear and countable to the -1 group, element 5 in bright light. An 8X 42 mm binocular used for comparison produced an identical result, as did a less-expensive 10X 42 mm.



It wasn’t until the chart was in the shade that the difference in glass and coatings really started to shine. The other 8X binocular reading dropped off to element 4, and although the 10X kept pace with the Swarovski, the latter’s image was much more crisp. With an orange-colored gel over the chart in sunlight, all three readings were identical. But, the CL Companion claimed top honors handily when the elements were changed to purple, green and blue-the latter two being critical for hunting.



The Swarovski’s 30 mm objective lens can’t defy physics and collect as much light as the less-expensive 42 mm models used for comparison, but biology, glass and coatings level the playing field. The Companion’s exit pupil diameter of 3.8 mm may seem nominal (a middle-aged man can process about 5 mm worth), but the binocular was noticeably brighter in diminished light and its ability to resolve the tiniest of details put the others to shame. It may lack the famed fluoride HD glass of its bigger EL Series brother, but the headache-free image is tack-sharp, edge to edge, and no chromatic aberration was observed.



The binocular is nitrogen-filled and rated as being submersible to 13 ft. of water, so it didn’t come as a surprise that nothing leaked after a two-hour soaking, complete with ice cubes. It didn’t fog when removed from the water bath in an air-conditioned room; but when introduced to 87º F. and 58 percent humidity, moisture condensed on its external surfaces-a natural reaction. Unlike some other high-priced gas-purged optics that have been subjected to the same test, though, the lenses wiped clean instantly and easily, rendering the Swarovski fully functional.



Field of view at 1,000 yds. is 372 ft. and it can focus on objects as close as 9.8 ft. The CL Companion 8X 30 mm weighs only 17.6 ozs. (sans strap and provided lens covers) and measures 4.7"x4.5"x2.3". Part of the weight savings is found in the single hinge instead of the pricier EL Series’ pair. Add a limited-lifetime warranty on optical components with a 10-year guarantee on mechanics, and it’s finally possible for most shooters to savor Swarovski’s heralded optical quality without breaking the bank.

    <title>Ruger LCP &amp; LC9 with Factory-Installed Viridian Laser or Light </title>

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://ruger.com/index.html" target="_blank">Ruger</a> has introduced two of its most popular pistols with factory-equipped <a href="http://www.viridiangreenlaser.com/" target="_blank">Viridian</a> lasers or lights.



The LCP or <a title="Learn more about the LC9." href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=14191&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=21" target="_blank">LC9</a> can now be had with either the Reactor green laser sight or the Reactor tactical light through TALO distributors.



Fans of green lasers understand the advantage of a beam that is up to 50 times brighter than conventional red lasers for around-the-clock, all-conditions targeting.



If a taclight-equipped pistol is preferred, the LCP or LC9 is fitted with the Reactor RTL. It illuminates over twice the horizontal area of standard taclights, because of its exclusive wide-beam Radiance lighting technology that puts the beam where it’s needed most.



“These Rugers have been two of the most popular handguns in the country for several years,” said Viridian President Brian Hedeen. “We are extremely excited to partner with Ruger to introduce the Reactor to more consumers across the country.”



Every LCP and LC9 fitted with a Reactor green laser or taclight comes with a pocket holster that is equipped with the ECR Instant-On technology. ECR Instant-On shuts the laser/light off while holstered. The laser/light instantly ignites the moment the gun is drawn. ECR eliminates fumbling with buttons, unfamiliar grips, and the delay and confusion that can arise in lethal encounters.]]>

      <![CDATA[A while back, I talked about <a title="Read Wiley's Trigger Shoe blog. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blogs/terminology-trigger-shoe" target="_blank">trigger shoes</a>, target triggers and the inadvisability of using either on guns that will be handled fast under stressful circumstances. I mentioned building up a combat 1911 on a Gold Cup receiver, then being disappointed with the results. For readers who may not know it, the Gold Cup pistol from Colt has an unusual trigger. It’s the familiar “long” length and it is much wider than the usual triggers. Wide enough to require a specially broached trigger slot in the receiver, this unit also installed a little lever to help protect the sear/hammer relationship. <a href="http://www.colt.com/" target="_blank">Colt</a> did this in order to give the bullseye shooter a perfect trigger feel to match a light trigger pull weight. Gold Cups saw a lot of use back in the Golden Age of bullseye shooting.



A reader took exception to my criticism of the Gold Cup trigger system <em>when used on a combat handgun.</em> I believe the increased frontal surface has no place on a gun that will be used in life-threatening encounters. The edge of the Gold Cup trigger is very close to the protection of the trigger guard and it’s easily brushed off when performing some maneuvers. It is always best to stay with a single “feel” for any trigger. This has nothing to do with trigger pull weight. Jeff Cooper’s combat triggers weighed about 3 ½ pounds, which is very light. They were the original thinner type. For its intended use, the Gold Cup pistol and special wide trigger is excellent. That use is on a formal shooting bench and bullseye range, where the gun is carefully picked up, fitted into the hand and fired five times at a round bull, 25 or 50 yards away.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Hmmm…well in the first place, I took exception in ‘Trigger Shoes’ not to the use of a Gold Cup trigger on a combat handgun, but its association with the old school trigger shoes, which were even wider, and frequently exceeded the width of the trigger guard. Most PDs banned their Officers from using because they were prone to discharge getting rubbed by leather when holstering the gun. More than a few Officers shot themselves in the leg from their use. The Gold Cup trigger, being narrower than the trigger guard, isn't even in the same class, or danger of that happening while being holstered. I rest my case on that.  In the second place, not everyone can be a Jeff Cooper, and reliably handle a 3.5 pound pull under stress of losing your life, no matter what the trigger design. That’s Hubris.  At least 98[%] of the general shooting public cannot handle that, and will misfire. The defining question to ask is, which is far more prone to being touched off.  A  light 3.5 pound trigger, or a Gold Cup trigger with the Colt factory set 4.9 pounds.  C’mon, that’s a no-brainer! An almost 5 pound pull simply cannot be touched off, unless  you the shooter take the safety off first, when you’re not ready.  And that violates a fundamental rule  of shooting safety. Responsibility for that lies solely with the shooter, and never the trigger design. Use of a light trigger under stress is far more prone to AD than trigger width, period. I stand by my original ‘Trigger Shoes’ post, and invite anyone to go back and read it. Signed---AMU_Vet.]]></comment_content>

      <![CDATA[<em>Photo <em>by Cpl. Mark Doran and</em> courtesy of the Department of Defense.

</em>



Thousands still stand on the front line of Freedom in Afghanistan and Iraq-including my oldest grandson. If you have a loved one deployed in the Sandbox, you know how hard it is to find the right gift. You don’t want to send anything they’ll have trouble bringing back after deployment, and to make the decision even more tough, today’s military provides a pretty good supply of the necessities and even sundries considered a front-line luxury not many years ago.



We shipped a pair of boxes to our grandson last week. Probably early, I know, but good insurance he’ll receive something by Dec. 25. Another goes out later this week. In our case, the packages contained mostly food. Forward operating bases don’t have the luxury of a PX.



It’s hard to go wrong with jerky. It keeps forever, doesn’t take up much room and thwarts hunger pains conveniently-even on guard duty. There are plenty of options out there, but about a year ago I received samples of this <a href="http://www.brownells.com/shooting-accessories/tactical-gear/outdoorsman-jerky-prod60402.aspx" target="_blank">Outdoorsman Jerky</a> and never even got a chance to give it a try. The grandsons, including the one currently deployed, sucked my supply dry in one afternoon. It’s good stuff, much better (according to the trio of samplers) than what you find at the grocery store. The fact it comes from a company with a pro-gun stance makes it even better. I went with the black pepper flavor, saved the hard-plastic container for myself and fill a package’s empty corners with the savory treats.



Headlamps get used in the Sandbox and the dime-store variety doesn’t last. My oldest grandson has been using SureFire, and claims it’s better than anything out there. Take a close look at the <a href="http://www.surefire.com/maximus.html" target="_blank">Maximus</a> if a deployed loved one needs a better-than-issue lighting source.



It’s cold over there right now, one reason why I also made sure (before he left, in this case) he had one of these <a href="http://www.mountainhardwear.com/dome-perignon-OM4962.html" target="_blank">Mountain Hardware</a> hats. It’s the warmest thing I’ve ever worn, and it’s nice to know when my grandson crawls into his sleeping bag he can don this hat if needed. The company may cater primarily to climbers, but the things it’s quietly done for members of SOCOM and its charity work make it one of my favorites.



Knives are a good choice, but be careful. Those in uniform are picky-rightfully so, since their knives don’t spend much time collecting dust in a drawer. I made sure my grandson got something he liked, and would never have guessed he preferred the somewhat unconventional shape of the <a href="http://www.blackhawk.com/product/Garra-II,683,37.htm" target="_blank">Blackhawk Garra II’s</a> blade.



It’s a far different situation than when my brother was in Vietnam, where canned mandarin oranges and fruit cocktail were prized package contents. One thing is the same, though. This holiday season our troops will still be standing guard, miles away from family and friends, protecting this great nation and each and every one of us who call it home. If you have some gift ideas for those deployed, share them in the comments section-I know for a fact there are a lot of families that will appreciate the help.

    <title>Para USA Pro Custom 14.45 Pistol</title>

      <![CDATA[In the mid 1980s, the Canadian-based gunmaker Para-Ordnance pioneered the double-stack M1911-style pistol. It was a design that was quickly adopted by law enforcement and competitive shooters alike because it solved the age-old problem of the 1911s ammunition capacity, while preserving the primary features that have kept the 1911 a popular choice amongst American shooters for over a century. In 2009, the company changed its name to <a href="http://www.para-usa.com/2013/index.php" target="_blank">Para USA</a> and moved to Pineville, N.C., where the pistols are still being manufactured today.



This year, the company continues to expand its line of full-size, wide-body .45 ACP pistols with the addition of the Pro Custom 14.45. This double-stack pistol was designed in conjunction with <a href="http://www.ipsc.org/" target="_blank">IPSC</a> World Champion Travis Tomasie for those who are looking to acquire a competition-style pistol without having to shell out the cash for a built-from-scratch gun. As a result, this pistol arrives ready for target work or self-defense, right out of the box.



The hand-fitted Pro Custom 14.45 is constructed with a stainless-steel slide and frame, both of which have been treated with the tough Ionbond PVD matte-black finish. The slide features front and rear slide serrations for improved cycling, Para's EGW HD extractor and a beveled ejection port. The dovetailed metallic sights consist of a green fiber optic in front and a fully adjustable target sight at the rear. The 5-inch, stainless-steel linked, match-grade barrel is ramped and cut with traditional land-and-groove rifling and supported by a competition-grade barrel bushing. The recoil assembly consists of a full-length guide rod and a single, round-wire recoil spring. A polymer bushing wrench is provided for pistol disassembly.



The front of this pistol's frame has traditional M1911 lines, meaning a rounded trigger guard and a short dust cover that is unencumbered by an accessory rail. This limits the number of gadgets that can be attached to the frame but keeps the pistol fully compatible with a broad assortment of 1911 competition and carry holster systems. The skeletonized hammer is paired with a generous memory-bump, beavertail grip safety. The match-grade polycarbonate trigger is also skeletonized and is fitted with an adjustable over-travel stop.



The round magazine release is located and operated from the left side of the frame, while the thumb safety is ambidextrous. The grip frame's frontstrap and main spring housing are finely checkered for improved traction. The black machine-textured G10 grip panels are provided by <a href="https://vzgrips.com/" target="_blank">VZ Grips</a> and held in place using black Torx-head screws. The base of the grip frame is fitted with a generous aluminum mag well for speedy reloads, and the steel 14-round magazines are fitted with aluminum bases beveled to match the opening of the mag well.



The Para USA Pro Custom 14.45 was taken to an outdoor range to check its reliability and accuracy. Working with top-notch full-size 1911s is usually an enjoyable event because of how comfortable they are to run and the satisfying results they produce on paper. This Para pistol did not disappoint on either count.



The craftsmanship and fitting of the pistol was top-notch, with the Ionbond PVD finish applied evenly for a dark, handsome, uniform finish throughout. Although the wide grip frame may be too large for some folks to use, the frame's checkering and the G10 grips made this pistol comfortable, even in my smaller-size paws. The texture of the grip panels is just right for most applications. They provide solid purchase, with or without gloves, but they are not so deeply textured as to be abrasive to bare hands.



The slide was exceptionally smooth, tight and free of side-to-side shake. The external controls operated cleanly with the magazine release locking and dropping magazines smoothly and the thumb safety snapping securely into position. The trigger broke crisply with 4 pounds, 5 ounces of pull, according to the digital trigger gauge.



Although I like fiber-optic sights in general, and use them on some of the guns I own, they are not always a good fit for target pistols. Often the light pipe employed is too large. As a result, the round face of the optic muddies the outline of the front sight when aligned with the square notch of the rear sight. However, the fiber-optic front installed on this pistol was just right for its intended applications. The thin green optic provided a bright reference point but it was small enough not to interrupt the square outline of the sight.



The Para USA Pro Custom 14.45 operated without any ammunition malfunctions throughout the testing process. It reliably cycled a mixed diet of full-metal-jacket, standard-pressure hollow points and +P loads. The weight of the pistol and the wide grip made for a moderate, controllable level of felt recoil with most of the loads fired.



The pistol was checked for accuracy by firing five-shot groups from a benchrest into paper targets set at 25 yards. The accuracy was impressive, with the best five-shot group of 2.24 inches produced using <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester's</a> Supreme Elite PDX1 230-grain bonded jacketed hollow point, which also produced the best average of 2.62 inches. The new <a href="http://www.barnesbullets.com/" target="_blank">Barnes Bullets</a> TAC XPD 185-grain +P hollow points yielded an average of 2.66 inches, followed by the <a href="http://federalpremium.com/" target="_blank">Federal</a> Personal Defense 230-grain jacketed hollow point at 2.78 inches. While I was perfectly happy with these shot groups, I learned that others have squeezed even better accuracy out of this pistol. One reviewer posted groups ranging from 1 to 2.25 inches using factory loads, which is markedly better than mine. I'll chalk it up to his having larger hands to wrap around the wide grip.



Over the past couple of years, I've had the opportunity to work with a few of the Para USA pistols and I have found plenty of reasons to be satisfied with their quality, craftsmanship and reliability. The Pro Custom 14.45 was no exception. In fact, this pistol has been very nicely tricked out with a variety of features that would cost much more in a built-from-scratch competition or a custom-shop defensive 1911. It's an impressive package that should appeal to 1911 fans looking to get a whole bunch of bang for their buck.

    <title>Nikon Prostaff 3.5-14x40 mm Riflescope</title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=26819</link>

      <![CDATA[Riflescope selection can be a daunting task. There are many manufacturers and each has what seems to be an endless array of offerings. Selecting the right riflescope is not as simple as picking a brand; sub-brands offering varying levels of quality are available from most optics companies. <a href="http://www.nikonsportoptics.com/en/index.page" target="_blank">Nikon</a> has three primary sub-brands-the top of the line Monarch series, and the more affordable Buckmasters and Prostaff series.



This sub-branding of product lines allow consumers to shop within their means. In other words, as a hunter you probably know what you need in a riflescope with regard to magnification, objective size and reticle specifics. You also probably know how much you can afford to invest. Nikon manufactures more than 100 different scopes, so being able to narrow that selection by price is helpful.



The Monarch line of Nikon scopes is priced between $280 and $1,400 dollars. The Buckmasters collection contains fewer options, but is more affordable with prices ranging between $250 and $350. Options within the Prostaff brand of Nikon scopes are just as extensive as in the Monarch line, but prices start at about $190 and range to a shade less than $600.



Times, as they say, are tough and even die-hard hunters are looking to save some cash. While your little heart might go pitter-patter when you pick up a Nikon Monarch 4-16x42 mm scope with side focus and a BDC reticle, you might also know your son needs new shoes, your daughter wants gymnastic lessons and your wife desires that new coffee maker for her birthday. Saving $100 is a good thing, and by moving to Nikon’s Prostaff line you can do that and still walk out of the gun shop with a quality riflescope.



For example, look at Nikon’s Prostaff 3.5-14x40 mm riflescope with the BDC reticle. This scope is loaded with features like hand-turn, ¼-m.o.a. windage and elevation adjustments that incorporate spring-loaded, zero-reset turrets. It also has a quick-focus eyepiece and a four times magnification range. There’s also 4 inches of eye relief so you can put it on your hard-kicking magnum and not walk away with a bleeding forehead every time you pull the trigger.



Additionally, multiple layers of anti-reflective compounds are applied to every glass surface on Prostaff scopes. This is done to provide a bright and vivid sight picture and optimum light transmission, along with maximum brightness from dawn to dusk. As a hunter, you know early morning and late evening are when things happen and you need to be able to see clearly.



One of the coolest features of this or any Nikon scope is how the reticle interfaces with the Nikon Spot On Ballistic Match Technology. Lets face it, unless long-range shooting is something you do every day, it can seem as complicated as calculus. Nikon has solved this complexity by interfacing all its reticles, specifically the BDC (Bullet Drop Compensating) reticle, with Spot On technology.



Here’s how it works. The BDC reticle has multiple circular aiming points built into the bottom, vertical crosswire. These points are spaced to match the average ballistic curve of modern high-velocity sporting cartridges. They’re not exact but they’re close. In reality they cannot be exact because of the varied trajectory of different bullets fired from different cartridges and the variation in muzzle velocity from one rifle to the next.



To make them exact, the Nikon Spot On program includes a database for most commercially manufactured loads. You power up the Spot On program–either on your smart phone or on the web–pick your scope, pick your reticle, pick your load and push the “fire” button. You can further tune the data by inputting the exact muzzle velocity your load generates from your rifle. The Spot On program then spits out the exact range each additional aiming point coincides to, with your rifle and your load.



I recently tested the Prostaff 3.5-14x40 riflescope with the BDC reticle on a <a title="Read the full Marlin X7 review. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/the-marlin-x7" target="_blank">Marlin X7</a> rifle chambered in .30-06. The rifle and scope made a great package and suggested retail for the pair was only $750! The scope performed to perfection. Adjustments were positive and exact; if you clicked in 2 inches of adjustment at 100 yards (8 clicks) that’s what you got. The optics were also as clear and distortion free as those in other scopes I’ve tested in the same price range.



Because I couldn’t resist and because it’s also fun, I plugged the Fusion 180-grain load into the Spot On software on my iPhone-at the average velocity this load generated from the Marlin X7-and consulted the reticle schematic. It said the first circular aiming point below reticle center would be “Spot On” at 199 yards. I held that aiming point on a 5-inch steel target at 200 yards, squeezed the trigger and heard the bullet smack steel. The Spot On program said the second aiming point would be spot on at 289 yards. A hit on an 8-inch steel plate at 300 yards showed confirmation.



For the money, <a title="View the Nikon Prostaff gallery. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/galleries/nikon-prostaff-gallery" target="_blank">Nikon Prostaff</a> riflescopes bring a lot to the table, especially when you consider the ballistic advantage they offer when combined with the Nikon Spot On program. Choose a Prostaff scope and you’ll be ready for the range or the hunt and you’ll have some cash left over for the family and for some ammo.<strong></strong>

      <![CDATA[The other night, three fire engines roared into my neighborhood a little after 10 p.m. Realizing that a problem was potentially at hand, I threw on some clothes and tramped out into the cold to learn whether or not this problem could affect my home and family.



Standing there, I watched firefighters in full gear dive off of their trucks to access the situation, all the while preparing to risk their lives for others. As I stood there, though, I realized that I was the only resident that had departed from indoor warmth out of curiosity or concern.



Since Northern Virginia, like many other urban areas, is covered by townhomes and condos, where problems in one unit can easily affect others, I was quite surprised. Sure, people can look out the window to view the lights, but don’t they want to know what unit could be on fire? The activity reminded me of the last time that the fire department was called out to my area, where only a few of the close to 100 residents exited to discover what was happening.



All this made me wonder whether it was a lack of curiosity or concern that kept people indoors when bright, red, flashing lights streamed through windows and sirens screamed into the darkness. Do people just assume that nothing can happen to them? Or are they just hoping for the best, and not preparing for the worst?



It seems to me that these are the people who stroll down the nation’s sidewalks, while checking email and not paying any attention to anything. They are probably also the people who have the greatest chance of being robbed or attacked. Don’t be one of these people. Curiosity makes you want to see the people around you in all situations, and concern helps you avoid danger.



I really just want to know that I’m not the only person out there who actually wants to know what’s happening in the neighborhood, especially if it can affect me and mine. Do you agree?]]>

      <![CDATA[Every new technological advance has critics. When anything new hits the market, there are those among us who will cling to the old ways and others who will criticize the advances for “going too far.” Ultimately, though, the buying public decides if it will embrace the new technology or reject it. If it brings something better to the table, it will sell. If not, it won’t.



<a href="http://www.remington.com/" target="_blank">Remington</a> thinks its new sighting system-the 2020-is the future of long-range hunting, yet before it was even shipping there were cries to outlaw it, some from people within the shooting industry. Personally, I look at how technology has improved our lives and think the market should decide. The lingering questions, though, are simple, “Is this sighting system the next big thing? Is it a game changer for shooters? Or is it hype that will disappear?”



My opinion is that it has elements of each, and which one wins out depends on Remington. Before I explain that statement-let’s take a look at the back story on the Remington 2020 sighting system.



<strong>Tracking Point</strong>

In January 2013, a Texas-based company called <a href="http://tracking-point.com" target="_blank">Tracking Point</a> introduced a new integrated rifle and sighting system in which a video screen scope with an internal laser rangefinder to measures the distance to the target and, using the latest in digital technology, factors in temperature, barometric pressure, incline/decline, cant, air density, magnus effect drift (spin drift), target movement and Coriolis effect drift. The internal computer then factors all that in with stored ballistic and firearm information including lock time, ignition time, in-barrel time, rate and direction of twist, muzzle velocity and ballistic coefficient. The unit can compensate for wind drift, but the shooter must manually input the wind speed information.



To make this all work, the shooter places a “tag” on the target by centering the crosshair <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-10-24-at-3.51.44-PM.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-26744" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="Screen Shot 2013-10-24 at 3.51.44 PM" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-10-24-at-3.51.44-PM-300x147.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="147" /></a>on his intended point of impact and pushing and releasing a button. The tag then feeds information to the computer, which is updated at a rate of 52 times per second, and the scope uses the combined data to calculate a “Ballistic Solution.” The unit then adjusts the image on the video screen to compensate and allows the shooter to aim the centered reticle where he wants to hit, regardless of the distance, or even if the target is moving.



The unit has video recording capability so that the shooter can record before, during and after the shot. It also has a built in Wi-Fi system that allows the view through the scope to be seen simultaneously on an iPad or iPhone. This Wi-Fi system will also download videos to your device and can be used in the other direction to make some internal adjustments to the sighting system.



The Tracking Point system’s trigger is integrated to the sighting system, and the rifle will not fire until the aiming point is exactly aligned with the previously placed tag. One version of the Tracking Point System is rated out to 1,200 yards, but ammunition is restricted solely to three loads by Barnes.



There are a few issues, some real and some imagined, surrounding the Tracking Point. The imagined is mostly based in the myths and misunderstandings about the integrated triggering system. The gun does not fire on its own as is believed by some uninformed critics. It can only fire when the reticle is aligned with the previously placed tag and the trigger is pulled. It is possible to pull the trigger while aiming off target and then, holding the trigger back, move the gun until the reticle and the tag are aligned. At that point the gun will fire. But the gun can only fire at a previously tagged target and only if the shooter is applying pressure to the trigger when the tag and the reticle align.



The main issue is the cost, as the Tracking Point rifle and optical systems range from $22,500 to $27,500. That high price eliminates all but the very well-heeled segment of the shooting public. But now there is a less-expensive option from Remington.



<strong>Enter Remington</strong>

The CEO of Tracking Point, Jason Schauble, used to work for Remington, so he got together with some of his old colleagues and they struck a deal for a new system called the Remington 2020. It does not have all the capabilities of the Tracking Point system, but does have most of its features. It does not have those issues creating the most controversy: The Remington 2020 system does not use an integrated trigger, and will operate independent of the sighting system.



The 2020 is sold as a package with a specifically matched Remington or Bushmaster rifle, and it is programmed to that rifle and a few specific ammunition products-it does not integrate with the rifle’s trigger. In fact it is simply an aiming tool, just like any other scope. While the laser rangefinder on the Remington 2020 is capable of measuring out to 750 yards under ideal lighting and target conditions, the software in the system is programmed to work to 500 yards. Because Remington is aiming (pun intended) at the hunting market, this helps control some of the “ethics” objections about shooting game animals at ultra-long range. Also, the units are still pricey. The 2020 has a suggested retail price of $5,500 with a Bushmaster Varminter rifle in .223 Rem. and $5,575 for a 2020 on a Remington Model 700 Long Range in .30-’06 Sprg. or the Model 700 SPS Tactical in .308 Win.



Each of the 2020 systems has software that allows the use of three different factory loads, one by Barnes and two from Remington. At this time there is no provision for the user to program in either handloads or any ammunition other than those pre-chosen by the manufacturer and programmed into the device.



The unit uses a video screen, so the shooter is in effect watching a movie of what the scope is seeing. They like to call this a “heads up display” (HUD). On the Remington 2020 screen there is a lot of other information that you will never find through a traditional riflescope.



On the left, top to bottom are: target speed and target range; ammo selection; mode selection; incline and a “check scope reminder” symbol. (Sort of like your check engine light, I guess.) On the right are: wind setting; recording time remaining; Wi-Fi status; battery status and an indicator of which battery is being used; tag off-screen indicator and the inclination indicator. Along the bottom left to right are: time; date; zoom level; compass; barometric pressure and temperature. Also centered in the bottom of the screen is a cant indicator to tell you if the rifle is tilted. Top center is the target zone indicator, which is the sensitivity of the “ready to shoot function.” When the crosshair is aligned on the tag and the gun is ready to fire, the crosshair will change from blue to red, indicating that the shooter can now fire and expect to hit the tag location. But, if the crosshair moves off the tag, it changes back to blue indicating that a shot will miss the tag location. If the gun required the tag and the crosshair to be exactly overlaid before the reticle changed color, it would be impossible to use as you could never hold the gun steady enough. So the shooter is able to adjust the size of the “target zone” in a range from 0.1 minute-of-angle (m.o.a.) to 4 m.o.a.



The shooter determines where to shoot as the tag and crosshair do not have to be aligned for the gun to fire. The shooter can place a tag on the target at an easy location to create the ballistic solution and then use the crosshairs to shoot where he wants to hit, just like a traditional scope. When hunting you can simply tag a deer any place the tag will stick to get the ballistic solution, and then aim at the vitals just as you would with any other scope.



The 2020 has three modes. “Advanced Targets” is for stationary targets, while “Advanced Movers” is for moving targets and has a predictive capability that will allow for a target moving up to 10 m.p.h.-simply aim where you want to hit and the scope makes the calculations and adjustments for lead. “Traditional Mode” is a mil-dot reticle with a 100-yard zero. The rangefinder still works in this mode, but the computer makes no changes and the scope functions more or less like a traditional scope where the shooter must hold over for a long shot.



The unit runs on two rechargeable, proprietary batteries. It uses one at a time so they can be hot-swapped. Expected life is about 1.5 hours for each battery. Of course, that is subject to ambient temperature, Wi-Fi use and other factors.



The unit is simpler to use than you might expect. I put the 2020 in the hands of my 15-year-old, video-game-addicted nephew and his buddy at the range, and they mastered it in no time. I showed his friend a few things as he was first shooter and, when it was my nephew’s turn, I started to show him. He looked up and said, “I got this, Uncle Bryce.” Then he started hitting small targets time after time with almost boring regularity.



Scott Ballard, a long-range shooting instructor at the <a href="http://sigsaueracademy.com" target="_blank">SIG Sauer Academy</a>, worked with me to test these rifles. He started off like most of us old gun guys, politely skeptical and mumbling “what the hecks” under his breath. But, after a half an hour or so, they changed to loudly proclaimed statements of, “This thing is pretty cool!”



All the ballistic solutions are predicated off a 100-yard zero, which is set at the factory, but the unit has a function for the shooter to adjust the zero. Once we had the zero confirmed, Ballard and I tested the gun out to its stated capability of 500 yards for the Remington 2020. (We did the same thing at 750 yds. for the Tracking Point System in .300 Win. Mag.). The ballistic solutions worked very well at every distance. We were able make center hits on targets at any range. I used the 2020 on a Bushmaster Varminter in .223 Rem. to ring 8-inch steel targets at 500 yards with every shot.



During another session, the same rifle delivered a five-shot group at 400 yards that measured 2.8 inches. We could also hit a 6-inch swinger plate at that distance every time. So, I am a believer in the ballistic system. It does a good job of compensating for the range.



<strong>Emerging Technology</strong>

But it’s not all rose petals and unicorns; there are a few issues. First of all, it’s a video screen. Have you ever tried to use your digital camera or iPhone in bright sunlight? Same thing here, it’s hard to see. The long eyecup helps. So does the detachable filter. But for a rifleman used to optical scopes, the image is not bright in any lighting situation and hard to see in some.



This is a digital zoom, so image quality degrades with increased magnification. I know they are working on this, and it’s being improved constantly, but when I hunted last spring with the Tracking Point system it was very difficult to identify any long range target when zoomed out.



The units had a tough time placing and maintaining a tag in lighting conditions other than perfect. They also had trouble with contrasting color targets such as a black target with a white center or a target covered with dappled shadows.



The 2020 unit is in a 100-yard view when you start, and when you place the tag it shifts the image to the distance that the tag indicates. If you place a tag at very long range, the unit will shift the image to adjust for the distance, and you may lose sight of the target. If the image moves off the limits of the screen (basically the 100-yard, pre-zoom view) you will lose the tag. At the very least you will need to reposition the rifle so that you can see the image and tag at long range.



This system of placing a tag and then going to the gun to shoot is slow. Most of the time it works well, but it never works fast.



This system is not for everybody. If you are a hard-core shooter, one that has been doing this long-range thing for a while, I encourage you to try the system. But, I’ll bet you will be bored with the simplicity and consistency of it pretty quickly and may decide it’s not for you. It does take the shooting out of shooting, particularly the Tracking Point Version. But then again, that’s kind of the point. This is the best system I have tried to ensure a first-round hit at long range. But the computer makes it happen, not the shooter or spotter.



However, if you love new technology, if you are the kind of guy who stands in line all night to be the first to get a next generation iPhone; if you like to be able to say that you were there when history was made and that you were part of it, this is your shooting system.



I hope there are a lot of shooters who want in on the ground floor of this technology because without them, it withers here in the first generation. I truly believe this can be game-changing technology. The visionary shooter, the early innovator, the explorer, those who love technology, need to embrace it, buy it and force Remington and Tracking Point to evolve and develop this technology and bring this from the Model T to the modern Mustang. That’s how game-changing technology develops. If the product provides enough quality and performance to attract early buyers, and if the company recognizes this enough to keep pouring its money back into research and development, refining the concept, then I truly believe this will change the way we shoot rifles at long range.



<strong>Tracking Point Shotview</strong>

This software lets you use an iPhone or iPad to see the same thing that the shooter is seeing through the scope. It’s very handy for instructing new shooters as well as for guides to insure they are on the correct animal. You can get it at the App Store, along with Tracking Point’s Precision Hunter Lite game.

      <![CDATA[The battered old chest held 43 pistols in individual slots, with seven empty spaces. Made from some of the strongest oak that ever grew in this fair land, the chest had a new coat of paint. Not surprisingly, it was green, with the freshly painted blue tactical markings of a company of Marines. That old chest, used for decades, was typical for its time and place. Every rifle company had one to hold its allotment of pistols to arm those Marines in the company assigned to carry them. Mostly, they were the guys who manned crew-served weapons, grenadiers, senior NCOs and officers. In the summer of 1964, the pistol was the U.S. M1911A1 .45 ACP semi-automatic. Now, pretty much everybody knows that the .45 Auto was the nation’s choice for fightin’ iron from 1911 on.



A decision was made to adopt a new 9 mm Luger service pistol in 1985, and I have never met a true handgun man who was happy about that. Back when it was the Browning-designed gun, we were content with the armament. As for me, I drew an M1911A1 pistol from the old chest the first time my new company went to the field and turned it in when we came back. But one day in the summer of ’65, I drew it from the box, slipped it into my holster and left it there for more than a year in Vietnam. A year like that tumultuous one tends to grow a bond between man and tool.



I do not mean to say that I was in any way different from hundreds of other Marines of my generation. When we went to war, the .45 was part of our gear; that is no longer true.



I understand the need for upgrading our equipment, but there was nothing wrong with the M1911 in the first place. That’s why so many of our troops-the ones closest to the pointy end of the spear-have been finding one means or another to lay hands on a .45 when they actually deploy to Southwest Asia. That unusual situation is no longer necessary. Colt’s Mfg. Co. now produces a special version of the M1911 pistol for the United States Marine Corps. And a smaller number of the special guns will be available for sale on the commercial market.



That constitutes good news, but there is some that is bad. Not all Marines will be getting the new version of the old pistol. The Corps asked for bids to provide somewhat more than 4,000 pistols to arm certain units of the Fleet Marine Force. Basically, the guns will go to Marines whose duties might require them to engage enemies at close range. In current military jargon, this is “Close Quarters Battle.” Many readers are going to be unfamiliar with the USMC unit abbreviations, so let’s take a moment to sort them out. MARSOC stands for Marine Special Operations Command, a fairly small unit of deeply trained Marines who work directly for the Dept. of Defense and theatre commanders. MEUSOC stands for Marine Expeditionary Unit Special Operations Capable. Built around an infantry battalion, reinforced with smaller special units (tanks, artillery, recon), a MEUSOC exists for a couple of years. It is then relieved from deployment by another infantry battalion that has run through the special training cycle that gives it the MEUSOC designation. Because of some additional training, such units are deemed capable of conducting special high-risk operations. Certain reconnaissance units-Division and Force-may also get the gun. It will not be issued to every operational unit of the Marine Corps.



Like everything else in today’s complex military establishment, the new gun has a designation. It is the M45A1 Close Quarters Battle Pistol (CQBP). Several makers submitted their versions of the gun, which were built to specifications developed by the Marine Corps. It was Colt’s Mfg. Co. that won the right to build 4,036 pistols and spare parts. Interestingly, the contract is written to be extendable in both numbers and time. There may turn out to be as many as 12,000 M45 pistols.



At the heart of the matter is a very nice version of the Colt Rail Gun. Many of the features found in this new .45 Auto are things developed by tactical shooters and police SWAT team members.



A sample pistol was provided by the maker for this evaluation. It was one of the commercial versions, which are assembled in Colt’s Custom Shop. These guns are the same as the actual pistols shipped to the Marine Corps, with the exception of the serial number and U.S. property markings. Two things are immediately noticeable the minute <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/coltmp.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-26753" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="coltmp" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/coltmp.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="264" /></a>you handle the gun. One is weight, which seems to be heavier that the ordinary commercial or service M1911A1. The other is color, which is a light desert tan. Intended for rough service in “every clime and place,” the M45 has a ceramic-based finish known as Cerakote. The dull finish seems unusual in the civilian context, but it is durable and will not reflect light. In a similar vein, the G10 stock panels are cut from a multi-layer laminate of tan, brown and green. Shaped in the familiar rounded cross section and machine checkered, the virtually indestructible stocks are much like one of today’s digital camouflage patterns. The left one even has a useful channel that increases access to the magazine’s release.



The M45 is a solid, durable rough-service pistol, with stocks and finish that befit its serious purpose. Current tactical operations at close quarters have placed the pistol in a unique role, particularly where low-light operations are concerned. Modern service semi-automatics often mount compact and powerful lights with which to identify targets. This practice is now so common that almost all service pistols have rails built into their dust covers, and this is how the M45 is made. Colt’s own rail gun receiver was the basis for the M45. The Marines get a pistol with a heavily strengthened receiver forward of the trigger guard and into which a section of Picatinny rail is machined. Right in front of the slide lock, the receiver is so thick that it protects the slide lock edge from dragging on equipment. I have mentioned that my first impression of the new Marine gun was that it was heavy. Most of that extra weight comes from the rail. As a matter of fact, the scale on the desk of the guy that wrote the specs was off. His said the gun weighed 40 ounces, but my scale indicated 42.5 ounces, and that’s 3.5 ounces more than the World War II M1911A1. Yes, it is a heavy gun.



It is also built extra-rugged in other areas. Since the M45 might be pressed into service in operations against criminals-pirates, druggies, terrorists, etc.-it must be capable of using any kind of .45 ACP ammunition. That includes some +P loads. Such wide variety in ammunition is much greater than the parameters facing John Browning in 1911. To ensure performance across such a wide spectrum of ammunition and to deliver decent service life, the M45 has a dual, spring-within-a-spring system of recoil springs. In informal shooting exercises, I tried a variety of different .45 ACP loads, running from +P 230-grainers to 185-grain semi-wadcutters. There were no problems in functioning and handling.



Speaking of handling, let’s look at the M45s controls. At the rear, the gun sports a so-called “beavertail” grip safety developed by Colt, as well as a rounded Commander hammer and flat mainspring housing with vertical serrations. Interestingly enough, the mainspring housing has a lanyard loop on its bottom surface because today’s SpecOps warrior often uses a modern version of the old khaki pistol lanyard. The magazine well is lightly beveled for speedy magazine changes.



As it is on many custom .45s, the new M45 has an ambidextrous thumb safety. Consistent with the preference of the majority of pistoleros, the trigger is the long variety first used in 1911. It has a black polymer finger pad. One final note on contours and controls-there is a nicely shaped undercut on the trigger guard that lets the middle finger get just a smidgen higher on the grip.



On the slide, the Marines specified, and Colt provided, cocking serration panels on both front and rear. Also, the ejection port is beveled at the rear corner and enlarged at the forward end. But the crowning glory of that top end is a set of genuine Novak LoMount sights complete with Trijicon’s tritium highlights. Inside, the gun has a Colt National Match barrel. While the gun is basically a Colt Series 80 Rail Gun, the enumerated features give it a very different character. It was time to take the new pistol to the range.



In both informal shooting and accuracy testing, the new gun did quite well during the course of several hundred rounds. I was surprised to see how well a familiar design responded to the addition of 3.5 ounces more weight. Recovery from recoil was a little quicker, as the heavier pistol tended to stray a shorter distance from the line of aim. Fast pairs are somewhat easier than with a standard M1911A1, and a good trigger action contributes to the equation. The sample did not have a light trigger, nor did it have an overtravel adjustment. But it broke at about 4 pounds, 12 ounces, and that was without noticeable creep. While my preference is for a slimmer grip, the G10 laminates on this gun are hand-filling and easy to manage. Also, I have grown accustomed to a checkered frontstrap and missed it on this gun. Nonetheless, from the handling and functioning viewpoint, the M45 is a formidable handgun.



That is a formidable one with superior accuracy. I shot the Colt M45 in the standard American Rifleman protocol-five consecutive, five-shot groups at 25 yards from the late Chuck Ransom’s machine rest. The results are tabulated nearby and show excellent accuracy. The average group size was slightly less than 2 inches and the best single group was 1.39 inches. This is sufficient accuracy for the demands of the work for which it was designed. It was a pleasure to have this gun for evaluation.



I can flatly state that this new M1911 variant is superior to the refurbished Remington Rand that I carried in Vietnam. The older gun was not quite as accurate as the M45 sample, although it was accurate enough for those times. The one thing that makes it a superior pistol more than any other is the big, east-to-see sights. Those miniscule little sights on the G.I. guns of old were at the top of everybody’s list of pet peeves.



It should be obvious that there is a great deal of nostalgia on the writer’s part where the new Marine pistol is concerned. It has not unduly impacted my evaluation of the gun. Any M1911 gets my attention, and one that says Colt on the side and has EGA (Eagle, Globe, Anchor) as a serial number suffix just has to be OK. Also, for the first time in the long, long history of the M1911 pistol, we have one that says “COLT USMC” on the left side of the slide.



It is a mark of distinction.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[The military has a history of reducing  the hole in the end of their handgun barrels from .45 to .35 and the result has always been a disaster. So when the US military adopted the 9mm pistol over its beloved .45 in 1985, it was justified as a concession to standardize ammunition within NATO. And besides, since the 9mm pistol was to be carried mostly by officers as a status symbol and support personnel as a 'feel-good' weapon, it really didn't make any difference because the 9mm was never envisioned as a combat round for the common soldier because they were armed with a rifle. But the elite units that actually pulled handgun triggers for a living knew better and either kept or begged for a .45. Now military history has completed the circle again as their handgun bores start to increase in size from .35 to .45. For the folks that fell in love with the 9mm because the police, FBI, and military used it, they just have to be having second thoughts now as all those entities have changed their minds and now believe in bigger bores. Experience is a great teacher and after years of watching the 9mm fail it was inevitable that the 9mm had to go.]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[Okay I am a 1911 guy  through and through. I have an original model 1911 the serial number of which is less than 8000 that has been handed down to me through two generations. It's over 100 years old and still shoots as well as anything I have ever shot. When I saw this new Colt I thought this is what it wanted more than anything. But it was not available at the time  so I bought a Glock 21.  I am so ashamed.  But the Glock is pretty amazing I must admit.

        <![CDATA[The M-1911 was designed specifically for killing militant jihadists. I can't recall how many times I saw the picture on the wall of various company headquarters depicting the Muslim Moro tribesman attacking Marines on the island of Mindanao. The Muslim civilization jihadists would zuke themselves up on drugs and tie off their arteries before attacking with their bolos, that is to say a type of machete like weapon, and the Marines would empty their revolvers putting rounds in the Muslim trash, but the Obamites would keep coming and hack at the Marines. So the Marines requested a sidearm that would put the Muslim scum down like the dirty dogs that they are. 
Utah has made the .45 the state sidearm--yeah, like the state bird or the state flower! Hah! Word has it that the Mormons wanted to convey a message to the Muslims. ]]>

When it was released in early 2013,  the price tag was close to $1,900.  At this time,  it's close to $2,100.  Even so,  Colt makes a few other pistols in this model.  ]]></comment_content>

I personally detest it.  And although modern rounds today are pretty much equal across the board the; low grade ammunition used by the US military creates a significant disparity.  There's more horror stories on it's ineffectiveness than anything positive.

      <![CDATA[Trying to explain why there has been a prolonged shortage of ammunition is like attempting to understand why people line up outside stores in anticipation of Nike launching its latest basketball shoe or Apple its latest iPhone. A run on a product-or in this case an entire category of products-is the result of a perfect storm of factors. So, for some much-needed perspective, let’s begin with the big picture.



First, we need to see if demand has indeed outpaced supply. Privately owned corporations aren’t in the habit of giving out sales and precise manufacturing figures for their competitors to peruse, so I contacted the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the trade association representing manufacturers of firearms, ammunition and related products. However, as ammunition made and sold wasn’t much of an issue in the past, the NSSF only recently began tracking ammunition production. Nevertheless, there is another way to understand the trend in ammunition sales. There is good historical data showing how much excise tax on ammunition has been paid annually. (Every time you buy a box of shotgun shells or rifle cartridges you pay an excise tax that was established in 1937 when Congress passed the Pittman-Robertson Act.)



Before getting into the numbers, it should be noted that tax revenue raised over time isn’t a perfect way to measure the sale of a category of products. For example, the prices of some premium ammunition have outpaced inflation. Also, commodity prices for copper and other metals over the past few years have generally risen, causing prices to rise for ammunition even faster.



Nevertheless, the tax figure is a useful way to understand overall sales trends.

So let’s look at the numbers. In 2000 the U.S. Department of the Interior reported that excise taxes on ammunition generated $68 million, whereas in 2012 that figure was $207 million. With inflation taken into account, that’s approximately a 129 percent increase in 12 years. A lot of that growth has taken place in the past few years. Between 2007 and 2012 excise tax money generated from ammunition sales almost doubled from $108 to $207 million. Tax dollars from ammunition sales were stable from the mid-1990s through 2006, but then started to climb fast as gun sales began surging.



To understand what $207 million represents, it’s helpful to know that in 2012 the NSSF estimated the size of the consumer rimfire, center-fire and shotshell market at about 9.5 billion shells and cartridges. That includes U.S. production in addition to imports minus exports. Last October the NSSF predicted there would be more than 10 billion cartridges and shells made for the American consumer market in 2013 as manufacturers attempt to keep pace with consumer demand.



Obviously this massive increase in demand has made it difficult for ammunition makers to keep up. Can you imagine what would happen if the demand for your other favorite products doubled in five years? Wouldn’t they likely be more expensive and harder to find? Also, ammunition production can be difficult to increase quickly because it takes investment in expensive machinery and additional personnel to increase production. Making more ammunition also requires companies to purchase more raw materials in a competitive and international marketplace. Manufacturers also must worry about overinvesting in a market bubble and thereby getting caught overextended in coming months or years.



Those are just some of the dilemmas facing manufacturers. Meanwhile, some gun owners have been speculating that this supply-and-demand problem is related to large government purchases. A few people have even hypothesized that the Obama administration might see reducing the ammunition supply via massive government buys as a clever way to enact gun control. After all, a government that would let guns be sold in U.S. gun stores to known straw purchasers so they could be illegally taken across the border with Mexico to arm drug gangs in a not-so-clever crime-fighting technique (if you believe that official explanation) seems capable of anything.<a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/excise.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-26762" title="excise" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/excise.jpg" alt="" width="877" height="283" /></a>



<strong>Are Government Contracts Eating Up Supplies?</strong>

Concerns from gun owners have been so loud there was even a congressional hearing. At the hearing in April 2013, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who chairs one of the House oversight subcommittees, noted that the Dept. of Homeland Security (DHS) is using more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition more per person than the U.S. Army. “It is entirely ... inexplicable why the Department of Homeland Security needs so much ammunition,” said Chaffetz.



Chaffetz noted that DHS bought more than 103 million rounds in 2012 and used 116 million that same year for about 70,000 public employees. Chaffetz said the DHS is consuming between 1,300 and 1,600 rounds per person, while he estimated that the U.S. Army goes through only about 350 rounds annually per soldier. Of course, anyone who has ever shot a machine gun knows that 350 rounds per soldier is a pretty tightfisted way to train people to shoot automatic arms. But then U.S. Army personnel train for a long list of job responsibilities, many of which have little to do with small arms. The deeper you look the more you realize that comparing the DHS to the U.S. Army is hardly an apples-to-apples comparison.



The DHS is a massive umbrella agency that includes more than 70,000 law-enforcement personnel across multiple agencies and more than 40,000 uniformed members of the military in the U.S. Coast Guard. The ammunition the DHS buys is used to support law-enforcement operations as well as routine qualifications and training for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Secret Service, the Transportation Security Administration and many other federal entities.



Nevertheless, worries spread in some circles on the Internet when it was reported that the DHS had a contract for a maximum of 450 million rounds of .40-cal. jacketed hollow-points to be supplied during the next five years. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-Ga.) investigated the contract and published a press release noting that, given all the agencies DHS buys for, “450 million rounds really isn’t that large of an order.” Westmoreland’s staff calculated that if the “DHS were to purchase all 450 million rounds over 5 years, then that would equate to only about 1,384 rounds of ammunition” per year per law-enforcement officer and so on.



Some nevertheless wondered why the DHS needs hollow-point ammunition. The answer, says DHS, is simply that hollow-points are the defensive ammunition of choice. A little reporting shows this is certainly the case for federal, state and local law-enforcement officers-as well as for many private citizens.



Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), meanwhile, asked the DHS for a breakdown of how much it spends on ammunition per agency and how much it uses annually (see table, opposite). The answers Coburn received deflated gun owners’ worries about government malfeasance. The DHS noted that it buys in bulk to save money, but overall its purchases have actually gone down. In 2010 the DHS purchased 148,314,825 rounds. In 2011 the DHS bought 108,664,054 rounds. And in 2012 the DHS purchased 103,178,200 rounds of ammunition.<a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/number.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-26813" title="number" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/number.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="253" /></a>



When I contacted the DHS for any update on these figures, Marsha Catron, a DHS spokesperson, answered: “DHS routinely establishes strategic sourcing contracts that combine the requirements of all its components for commonly purchased goods and services such as ammunition, computer equipment and information technology services. These strategic sourcing contracts help leverage the purchasing power of DHS to efficiently procure equipment and supplies.”



Ammunition manufacturers back up the DHS’ explanation. For example, Federal Premium Ammunition, which has 1,400 employees making ammunition in Anoka, Minn.-some for federal contracts-published a statement saying that the rumor DHS is “buying excessive quantities of ammunition, thereby restricting availability to the commercial market,” is a “false and baseless claim.” Federal Premium says, “The Department of Homeland Security contract makes up a very small percentage of our total ammunition output. This contract is not taking ammunition away from civilians. The current increase in demand is attributed to the civilian market. Our production volumes on government contracts have been stable since the mid-2000s.”



<strong>How Ammunition Makers Are Responding</strong>

The increased demand has prompted ammunition makers in the United States to expand facilities, add new shifts and streamline production. Federal Premium says, “Our facilities operate 24 hours a day. We are continually making process improvements to increase our efficiency and investing in capital and personnel where we have sustained demand. We are bringing additional capacity online again this year.”



As it works to catch up with demand, Federal posted a statement on its website saying, “We are currently experiencing high demand for our products. We appreciate your patience and support and remain committed to serving all of our customers, from hunters and sport shooters to those who protect our country and our streets.”



Winchester Ammunition’s official answer is: “Like many manufacturers in the shooting sports industry, we are experiencing an extremely high demand for our products. We are working as hard as we can to produce an increased supply of quality ammunition to meet our customers’ needs.”



Scott Blackwell, president of Freedom Group, an American firearm manufacturer holding company that includes Remington, Bushmaster and DPMS, said, “Most of the ammunition we make at Remington goes to the consumer market. Our supplies, therefore, haven’t been affected by government contracts. It’s clear to us that any lack of supply in the marketplace has been from consumer demand for our quality products. To meet this increased demand we’re investing and growing.”



Last fall Remington Arms Co. announced that it will spend $32 million to expand its Remington Ammunition Plant in Lonoke, Ark. The expansion includes the construction of a new building, which is projected to be in operation by the second quarter of 2014.



Steve Hornady, president of Hornady Ammunition, told AmericanRifleman.org: “We’re working as hard as we can to get as much out as possible … . People walk into the store, they don’t see as much as they want so they take everything they can get. The next guy who comes in can’t get anything, so he panics … . But there is no government conspiracy.”



There has certainly been price gouging by enterprising individuals as some people buy up all they can find so they can resell the ammunition over the Internet. Also, as Hornady noted, a lot of gun owners are simply stockpiling when they can to avoid future problems. Those are classic occurrences in a run on any popular product.



<strong>Why Has Demand Gone Up?</strong>

There are now more than 5 million women participating in the shooting sports, an increase of 46.5 percent since 2001, according to the NSSF. The number of gun owners in America surpassed 100 million a few years ago and all indicators show it is still growing. More gun owners means more ammunition being shot. Also, as the most popular firearms being sold in recent years have been semi-automatic handguns and rifles, it only makes sense that these gun sales would lead to more ammunition being purchased and shot.



There are a lot of other numbers tracking the growth of gun sales and gun ownership that have led to more ammunition sales. For example, July 2013 was the 38th straight month that the number of background checks called into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) increased when compared to the same month the previous year.



Not every background check results in a sale, but NICS numbers are a good indicator for overall gun sales. Over the 10-year span from 2002 to 2011 there was a 54.1 percent rise in the number of NICS checks. In both 2009 and 2010 there were about 9.5 million NICS checks; in 2011 the number grew to 10.7 million; in 2012 it surged to 13.7 million; and as of this writing it looked like the number of NICS checks would break the annual record again in 2013.



You can also see this trend reflected in the number of concealed-carry permits in the United States. The number of people with concealed-carry permits has grown from fewer than 1 million in the mid-1980s to 6.8 million by the end of 2012, according to the NSSF. This increase has certainly resulted in the sale of more handgun ammunition.



There are a lot of other statistics charting the growth in gun sales and gun ownership. In sum, ammunition makers have determined that the increase in demand isn’t just a market bubble, which is why they have been aggressively investing. As this was being written there was still ammunition rationing taking place at some ranges and gun stores and there were still empty shelves in some areas, but most stores have been reporting that the crisis is diminishing as ammunition manufacturers catch up with demand.



It’s worth mentioning one silver lining to this surge in sales as a parting thought. As previously noted, every time someone buys a box of ammunition they’re paying a tax. This excise tax must be used for wildlife conservation projects, gun ranges and other such outdoor-related programs as mandated by the law. The revenue also must be sent to the states for these purposes-the federal government can’t use these funds except for some administrative purposes. So that $207 million raised from ammunition sales in 2012 is benefitting state wildlife departments, your gun ranges and more.]]>

        <![CDATA[I have no doubt that there has been panic buying by consumers. And, that there are multiple reasons that there is an ammunition shortage.  But you left out one.  The EPA is closing a number of factories and power plants with their new regulations.  One of these plants is the last lead processing plant in the US.  The government knew this was happening and contracted for ammo at a fixed price.  In 2014, the manufacturer's will have to import their lead, thus raising prices.  If you where a manufacturer with a fixed price contract and a rising material cost next year, you would try to fill that contract as fast as you could with the material you have.  The manufacturer's have released just enough ammo to the public to keep them going [(]remember the 1 million .22 rounds to the shooting sports in May?[)].  The new ammo that we are seeing on the shelves this month reflect some of the new pricing.  The situation will even out over the new couple years, but we will all pay 5 times more for a box of shells than we did just 10 years ago.
Don't be surprised if Obama puts tariff's or restrictions on imported lead in the coming months.]]>

        <![CDATA[Enjoyable read but I found it to be mostly fantasy or at the very least the 'cool aid' that 'WE' as consumers are expected to swollow.
As GM of a retail Gun Store in Lake Havasu AZ I get to talk with both customers and suppliers, one ammunition manufacturer told me face to face the company he works for produces 4million rnds of 22lr per day, 7 days per week. I have not seen a box of 22lr in my shop in over 6 months so I am a little confused with the figures you have put together and the title of the story, 'Why We've Had An Ammunition Shortage'.......'Had', implies the shortage is over dosen't it? If this is true please tell me where I can find product to put on my shelves. ]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Although the article did a masterful job of telling us who is NOT responsible for the shortage, it didn't tell us very much about who, what, and why the shortage exists.   In the midwest, we are still seeing a major shortage and rationing by the retailers - which means they are not getting the product from the manufacturers.   It would be a great help to know why, and when [(]if ever[)] it might ease to a point that I can resume competitive shooting.   Not only are specific calibers not available, but neither are the components for reloading - powder, primers, and bullets are almost nonexistent, and brass is getting harder to find - and much more expensive.    I don't really care who is responsible, I just want it to END.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I live in Central Indiana. For a YEAR there has been little to no 9mm or .22LR. Does not matter where you go. Our Walmart has had 9mm once in a year never any .22LR. All around Indianapolis, it is scarce. When it can be found, it is some gun dealer selling a box of 9mm [(]50 rounds ball ammo[)] for $35 or more. There is something missing from the 'facts' in this article. My experience applies to friends I have all over the nation and this is an issue we discuss monthly... seems like another article that fails to explain much of anything. And when you interviewed the DHS, who would be foolish enough to believe ANYTHING government tells us any more?! REALLY?]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[As someone who has been buying and selling ammunition online for quite some time now, I can tell you there is absolutely no shortage of ammunition in the United States. There is, however, a shortage in retail stores. Why? Because retail stores can only mark up ammo prices to what their local customers will bear. When you sell online, you can court customers from across the nation. Customers who are used to paying for a high cost of living [(]think big cities[)] are willing to pay more than customers who are used to a low cost of living [(]think suburban/rural[)]. Big cities also have a higher population, and contrary to popular belief there are a lot of gun owners in big cities despite the left-leaning politics of those cities. So the shortage is only on the retail side...the ammunition is there. Don't believe me? As of the time of this comment, there are currently 18,000+ ammunition auctions on Gunbroker alone. 700+ of those are .22 LR ammo. This is about opportunistic buying and reselling, not government interference. The panic buying is largely over as prices have dropped in recent months [(]I collect and analyze this data on a large scale[)]. My research indicates that private citizens are cashing in on the easy profits to be made by buying what they can find locally and reselling for more nationally. There's nothing more to it. The good news is that the profitability of this behavior will continue to decline, though don't expect to ever see ammo prices as low as they used to be in 2012.<!--mobile-->]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[To me it seems this 'shortage' was created by mass retail chains. Example I live in a small town and one day walmart was fully stocked then the next morning they had nothing on their shelves. I did see that they had all of their ammo under the counter behind the solid doors that you can't see through. Caught a glimpse of it when a worker opened it looking for a hunting reg booklet for me.  That made me realize how in my small town every single box of ammo disappeared over night [(]even the odd ball stuff[)]

Makes me thing these huge chains bought out the ammo to starve people so they can hike the price. Like 223 walmart was 4.88 a box o 20 now it's 9.88 for the same box.

I do run a business that sells ammunition too and none of my suppliers have had any til recently though the prices are still sky high from them.]]>

        <![CDATA[I second what Mr. Reynolds stated. A family member works at a large Western and outdoor store here in Great Falls, MT. They have a standing order for .22 ammo from all their suppliers. 8 mos ago they got in a pallet and it was gone in a day. Since then it's been a few 50 and 100 rnd round boxes at a time. This is a company with multiple outlets throughout the West, not a Mom and Pop store way down on ammo feeding chain. 
If ammo is being produced at the volumes stated many of us are at a loss at to where it's going because every retailer says the same. 'We are not getting it'.  ]]>

        <![CDATA[I see people are still wondering about the .22LR shortage.  

Well, I have 3 frineds that bought over 20,000 rounds EACH back just as the shoprtage was being felt.

Multiply that by how many friends we al have that bought that much or more, and you begin to see why and what is happening.  Every time I see .22LR for sale, I buy all I can, EVERY TIME I see it!



I am NOT a kool-aid drinker, but I am also a reasoning, non paranoid type, and I can see where the shortage is going.

And something else, the Government doesnt use .22LR for anything.  they use .223, 9mm and .40 so the gov would account for the 22 shortage anyway...

      <comment_content><![CDATA[@Chris Want: ''Why We've Had An Ammunition Shortage'.......'Had', implies the shortage is over dosen't it?' Actually, no. 'We've had' is short for 'We have had', and 'have had' is the present perfect tense, indicating that there was an ammunition shortage in the past, that has continued in the present. The ammunition shortage has definitely recovered some, but not completely. I used to buy a 1000rd case of brand new 9mm brass for $220. Now I have to get remanufactured brass to get that price. However, during the worst of it, even the reman stuff cost $400 for 1000 rds. You can now get 22lr for under $.20 a rd, but nowhere close to the $.04 a rd before this craziness.<!--mobile-->]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[THe ammunition supply continues to be filled unabated by the manufacturers.  If you go to Europe or Africa, there is no shortage of ammunition. The shortage is only here in the U.S.  As allueded to by one poster, the ammo shortage can be found on Gunbroker and other sites.  I saw 525 packs of Federal 22, 2 [(]1050 rounds[)] sell for $275.  That is in reality well less than $100 of ammo, but someone was willing to pay because somebody else made them afraid they would not be able to buy any more.



Blame the preppers and the hoarders.  Blame the Internet ammo stores.  That's where the ammo is.



As for the 'ammo behind the doors' at Wal-Mart, many retail employees will buy whatever comes into the store first, often before it hits the shelves. [(]I have  confirmed this with employees from both Wal-Mart and Dick's Sporting Goods[)].  They get some, or tip off their friends that it is there and ammo sells out instantly.



Blaming this shortage on some 'grand conspiracy' is foolish and shortsighted.  Go look in your own ammo bunkers and then ask yourselves where the ammo is.

        <![CDATA[The article in the latest “American Rifleman” entitled “Why We've Had an Ammunition Shortage” is a good start on the shortages experienced for more than a year by American shooters but unfortunately falls short of addressing two major sectors.  Let’s look at these chronic shortages and bring to light what is behind these problems in a future article.

Imported Handgun Ammunition
Where has the imported handgun ammunition gone?  Yes the really cheap, steel case stuff is available in limited quantities and the really expensive ammunition is available in limited quantities but that is a fraction of the import market.  I don’t mean rationing but reasonable quality brass case handgun ammunition has not been on the market for over a year.  Take a look for 9mm, 38 Special, 45 ACP Sellier & Bellot ammunition on the Sportsman’s Guide website and you will see what I mean.  Is there a rush on handgun ammunition in Europe such that they can no longer export to their best market – the American consumer?  Let’s get an explanation for these chronic shortages.

Reloading Components
A large portion of NRA members reload.  Unfortunately reloading components were not addressed in the article.  To be fair a few reloading components are starting to appear in the market place although very few.  I waited 8 ½ months for powder order form a reputable vendor, H-4831-SC hasn’t been available in this area for over 2 years and for almost a year some on-line vendor refuse to take backorders on powder not in stock.  I can’t get quality primers, and though some rifle bullets can be had if you’re willing to wait a few months they are difficult to buy.  Jacketed pistol bullets in popular calibers are extremely difficult to find and for the most part nonexistent.  It is difficult to support a Prairie Dog hunting habit when components are so hard to acquire.  I would certainly like to see an investigation into the year and a half dry spell in reloading components.

Further, the article skirted any political issues in a rather coy fashion.  Let’s face it the large scale shortages erupted after the big push for GUN CONTROL in late 2012 and early 2013.  Call it panic buying if you will but that only explains 3-6 months of shortages.  Once the gun control measures failed on a national scale and the smoke cleared here we are with no imported handgun ammunition and no reloading components.  

We are experiencing de-facto gun control because without ammunition or components to make your own the guns remain silent.  What’s up?

        <![CDATA[What we should be thinking about now is what come after?  IOW if 'the shortage' is consumer driven which it appears to be and that is driven by concerns leading to hoarding, then some time soon the demand is going to be met. If this is ourely consumer driven then we will be left with a huge surplus in manufacturing capacity as even the most concerned buyer is going to reach a point of saturation.   

 A consumer driven shortage should not las!

When shooting trap competetively, I used about a case a week on average [(]20 boxes a week or 26,000 12 Ga shells per year.[)]  While shooting competetively I shot only new shells even for practice.  They were cheaper back then and I shot a whole lot better at 40 that at 70.

I've been unable to get enough centerfire pistole and rifle ammo and 22 rimfire over the past two years to maintain my level of competency.

Now if we suddenly end up with a surplus of capacity, that means equipment, workers, and supplies tied up with no useful output.  I would think that would drive prices up because someone has to pay for that and the manufacturers can't just eat that expense.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[This appears to be another problem driven mostly by greed.  Buy the ammo reasonably and sell it for maximum dollars.  How much are you willing to pay?  325 .22LR for $120?  If you pay that price, you're only contributing to the problem.  A year ago, AR's were selling for as much as $3000.  Why, because consumers were willing to pay that much at the time.  When the panic subsided, the shelves filled up and the price dropped like a rock.  The same thing will happen to ammo if the consumer just stops the panic buying and allows the shelves to fill up.  It's simple supply/demand marketing.  As long as you keep buying the shelves empty, the price will continue to climb.  Wake up boys and girls, you're doing it to yourselves.<!--mobile-->]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[It looks to me like someone said - the big stores are manufacturing a shortage so they can charge us an arm and a leg for 22's. Our local Gander Mountain had an ad in the paper saying they had CC Mini-Mags - 100 round boxes for $7.95 a box and High Velocity for $32 for a box of 300.  Got there the day the ad came out all they had was standard velocity CC 22's $55 for 500 - bought them because they may be the last ones I can find.

        <![CDATA[For those of you who think Mr. Miniter didn't say WHAT the cause was, go back and read it again.

The shortage has been caused by the huge increase in purchases by all of us gun owners as a group.  Winchester's first quarter report shows that they had about 3 times as many orders as the could ship from their commercial [(]non-government[)] accounts. Their shipments to commercial accounts were up $40 million over 2012, but backorders skyrocketed from $138 Million to $495 million in 90 days.

Great article, Mr Miniter!!<!--mobile-->]]>

        <![CDATA[ “DHS were to purchase all 450 million rounds over 5 years, then that would equate to only about 1,384 rounds of ammunition” per year per law-enforcement officer and so on. 

1,384 rounds of ammunition per yer per LEO. 95[%]+ of most federal LEO's only qualify once a year, and that is the most of their firearms training or usage. As a LE firearms instructor most LEO's don't need 1,384 per year for qualifications. They aren't in a combat zone expending rounds in fire fights. Most annual LEO qualifications only require 100-150 rounds MAX. What are they doing with the other 1,200 rounds?]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[It's amazing to see how many people assume that since they don't see the ammo on the shelves, that it doesn't exist... I have worked on both sides of the country during this freak out period and I can tell you, the .22lr is out there, I know, I have had my hands on it and sold it to the same 40 old men who are at my place of business every morning and bring their wives and every other person they can find of legal age to purchase their limit for them, EVERY DAY... THAT is where your ammo is going! The location I am currently at [(]part of a major chain[)] had 280 bricks of remington olden bullets on black friday @ $18.98 for 525. We sold out in exactly 19 mins. Guess what, most of the people buying were the same faces we see over and over and over again. We get 50 to 80 bricks in a shipment, at least once, most weeks, and it still hasn't lasted more than 2 or 3 hours. At both companies on both sides of the country, I received significantly more .22lr than I had EVER received during a normal time period. Just because these hole in the wall gun shops don't have the buying power to get it doesn't mean it doesn't exist... I have multiple customers, by coming in every single day, have literally bought over 20,000 rds from me since May. There's your real problem!]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[As for Walmart. I have 5 supercenters near me that I check on for .22 lr ammo regularly. When I ask about it I get the same line, ' we had some this morning but it was bought up in less than a half an hour'. I was there at the time they mentioned and there was no .22 ammo. Or the other line is ' we had some yesterday morning but it was all gone within 30 min. Or so.

I'm retired and like to shooty .22s.

That's why I check on their supplies at Walmart. One thing is for sure in my area, Fenton MO, I am being lied to by Walmart!

Think what you will. Carry on.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I own a gunstore. No matter where I try to order .22 ammo, it is never available and has not been for a year. Our local Walmart gets in .22, but only in limited quanities and with no regularity. I don't have the answer but I do know I don't trust the government. I don't know that I really trust the manufacturers either since they are large corporations that the government could easily use the IRS to control. As far as blaming it on the hoarders and gougers, I am sure they are responsible for the supply and demand price of what ammo they can get their hands on, but even with the number of online auctions, there are not enough to account for the ammo missing from  the shelves. I wish someone we could trust could give us a genuinely researched and accountable explanation.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[It would be nice if an economist could explain the shortages.  The supply and demand curve sure doesn't fit here.  You would think that with prices raising, there would be a softening of demand - but you would be wrong!  I know there are other factors in play here but the numbers do not add up.  Take any caliber and divide the total rounds manufactured by the number of gun owners and it just doesn't make any sense.  How much higher must the price of ammo go to temper demand?  Or how much longer before everyone in the country has 5000 rounds of ammo for every gun they own.  Gotta be gettin' close! ]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[I have not seen .22lr in almost a year - I live in Port Orford, OR and do my shopping in Coos Bay [(]55 mi[)] as they are large enough to have some of the bigger stores - but ammo is obviously scarce unless you are willing to pay outrageous prices for it. 

I must admit, that although I have not been able to buy and I haven't stockpiled any, if I did have the opportunity to store some away, I would.  I believe that our economy is going to fail because there are many in our government that want it to fail.  Why else would they have been adding over $45 Billion / month until Aug 2012, when they upped it to over $85 Billion / month!  No government in the history of the world has survived after adding fiat money to the system for more than a very short period.  So, ours is destined to fail as every politician knows this and hasn't bothered to stop it [(]but they did relish their own kickbacks when it doubled[)].

So to be honest, yes I would stockpile.  If I had the money I would also invest in precious metals.  Since I am on the lower end of the financial spectrum, I advise [(]myself and others[)] to invest in precious metals, and if you can't afford platinum, gold and silver, then buy guns and ammo!  And the ammo I would advise that would be the most easily used in bartering for other goods - .22lr and 9mm!

And I know I'm shooting myself in the foot, but I'm old, and may not survive long , but for others with families, take heed - Obama promised CHANGE, and it is coming.]]>

        <![CDATA[I am not a mathematician, but speaking with 20+ years in LE there isn't any way I am buying into these government numbers of  1,300 > 1,600 rounds fired per person yearly for either/both training and/or qualifying with a firearm!

With agencies that I have either worked at, or have firsthand knowledge from associates in other agencies, including small to large agencies, they do not use premium/new  ammunition to practice! Not once, in the three agencies I worked for did I train using new ammo, only reloads! Yes, there are exceptions to this, but how many? There is the likelihood that some agencies use new ammo, of the type used on-duty to qualify, but what percentage? Also, how many agencies, of any size, provide the officers duty ammunition? Or each time they qualify is a new box of fifty issued?

I also know that most agencies do not have a mandatory firearm qualification every month! One of the agencies I worked for tried doing that, but the cost of thousands of additional rounds of ammo [(]even just reloads[)] was financially cost prohibitive and the budget wouldn’t stand the additional costs! Subsequently, qualifications returned to each officer needing to train/qualify every three months. And, some agencies only require twice a year, or even once. I don't have the figures on this, only my 20+ years of active LE experience, but the majority of agencies I have firsthand knowledge of, including those I worked for, do not have monthly qualification!

Also, using this article's figures of 1,300 > 1,600 rounds fired by each federal LE officers is amazing to me. They are either the best small arms personal, or the worst! Just how many rounds are required to train and/or pass a qualification? A more realistic number would be a box of fifty rounds per officer in my experience. And, are these federal agencies required to a mandatory once per month qualification/training?

My years of government experience as a LE Officer has given me insight into many things, especially what is being said, and not what is being done! My experiences have taught me well… Never believe what you are being told by any government agency! That’s why I always wore boots on-duty! 

If you trust/believe these outrageous government explanations and numbers, you need a reality check!]]>

        <![CDATA[None of this covers the EPA making it harder to smelt lead, or the proposed extreme taxes on ammunition. We can expect ammunition prices to stay high and only increase in the future no matter what the excuse. The smelter in question is the last Primary lead smelter in the United States which means all raw lead will have to be exported and refined then imported again to be used. Any point in the route can be blocked by a hostile regime and recycled lead will be the only route to an affordable product.
The question remains. Why are domestic 'police' activities receiving more ammunition than the military? If other proclaimed statistics about lower crime rates are factual there should be less need for ammunition and armed agencies, but maybe we're looking in the wrong direction. 
More and more people are being declared criminals since this regime took over and the daily lives of many people who cannot find work are increasingly uncomfortable. Everything points to civil insurrection and Martial Law being imposed to take care of the problem. We shouldn't be concerned with ammo when the real problem is the Police State that is growing in size and scope. 
I urge people to step aside from the guns and ammo aspect of this shortage to look at the big picture. A 100[%] increase in firearms and ammo sales should tell you something isn't normal. It's a good development for pro-gun people, but it means there is a lot of palpable fear in the population, and that's the problem.
Is the government buying too much ammo? YES! Just the idea that hundreds of thousands of rounds or more are to be used for 'operational' purposes should strike fear into everyone who reads and deciphers this information. Let's not forget that the government isn't supposed to have it's own military and all police powers are supposed to be subservient to the people. We all know that government is no longer responsive to the people and the law of the land, so where do we go from here?]]>

        <![CDATA[There has certainly been price gouging by enterprising individuals as some people buy up all they can find so they can resell the ammunition over the Internet. 

And businesses, like Cheaper than Dirt, Lucky Gunner and Bulk Ammo, which I think are the same company, among others. Make sure you do not forget all the businesses that took advantage of customers. Remember them and shop elsewhere. ]]>

        <![CDATA[Note that the number of rounds of ammunition used for operational purposes only amounts to roughly 20[%] of the total number of rounds consumed.

I assume that the chart includes handgun, rifle and shotgun ammunition but I suspect the handgun ammunition makes up the vast majority.

If less expensive full metal jacket [(]FMJ[)] handgun ammunition were used for training purposes and more lethal jacketed hollow point [(]JHP[)] ammunition were used for operational purposes, there should be significant savings, as generic FMJ rounds are less expensive than premium JHP ammunition. There would be no appreciable difference for training purposes due to the use of the less expensive ammunition.

The military must use non-expanding FMJ ammunition, as the Geneva Convention prohibits the use of expanding bullets by military forces. Note also that the military does not use .40 caliber handgun ammunition. They use 9mm NATO handguns, although some special forces personnel use .45 AUTO caliber handguns.

On the other hand, if DHS only purchased JHP handgun ammunition to assure that large quantities of the more lethal ammunition would be available should martial law be declared, then it would be justified to only purchase JHP ammunition and pay the premium for the JHP ammunition used for training.

It seems to me that the average use of 1300-1600 rounds of ammunition per person each year is a lot of ammunition. Like the military, many DHS employees do not normally carry, or are even trained to use, firearms. Because of this, those that do use firearms use an even larger amount of ammunition.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I don't buy it. Plain and simple the shortage is too coincidental to the Obama war on firearms ownership. Since the shortage started there has been enough time for the free market system to have spawned $$$$ signs in the eyeballs of any people connected to making profits from this legal product to the point of going whole hog in finding new ways to meet the demand of the hungry hordes eager to spend their cash on what they want. Even dummies like Michael Moore know guns are reduced to paperweights without ammo. There should be NO SHORTAGE of this legal product unless forces above and beyond simple supply and demand are frustrating larger supplies for larger demands. ]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[At Louisville KY gun show last weekend, anyone could find as much ammo as he or she might want to normally buy, including such hard to find items as .45 Auto Rim [(]which have been very hard to find for past 2 years[)]. The ammo makers are putting it out there and in this area things appear to be slowly returning to normal, except for pricing which is still being held high by retail sellers.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[The cause of the problem is simple and its not the hoarders.  The problem is the Democrats.  The hoarding and panic buying is because the people don't trust them or their motives.  We saw the exact same thing back in the 1990s over primers when the Clinton gang stated they wanted new primers with a limited shelf life.  I used to be able to go to the sporting goods counter in my local grocery store and buy one or two boxes of primers whenever I needed them to do some reloading.  Once the primer scare started, you had to buy them online in packs of 5000 to be able to get any at all.  The manufacturers aren't going to expand their ammo production because they don't trust the gun grabbing Democrats any more than the rest of us do.  Any expansion will be based upon a carefully calculated future stable sales market.  Why would they want to expand when they know this administration wants to put them out of business at the firat available opportunity?  Face it people, we're not going to see stocked ammo shelves until two years into the next Republican administration and congress.  It will take that long for people to regain their confidence in a new regime and actually acquire all the ammo they want so they'll never be caught offguard again.  The Democrats are like a bad case of herpes.  They may go away for awhile, but they always come back again later to irritate you. ]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[

 'Some nevertheless wondered why the DHS needs hollow-point ammunition. The answer, says DHS, is simply that hollow-points are the defensive ammunition of choice. A little reporting shows this is certainly the case for federal, state and local law-enforcement officers-as well as for many private citizens'. 

 They don't train with hollow point ammunition and they don't issue 1300 rounds per officer ! ]]>

        <![CDATA[The information Mr. Minter provided was overshadowed by the information he did not provide, insinuations and misleading readers by the old political trick of using correlation instead of causation reasoning.
 1[)]Your paragraph concerning 'Business 101' was far from enlightening or revealing. Every producer/manufacturer in the free market economy is faced with the same issues. You failed to provide the readers with the answer to what this has to do with the shortage of ammo? Are you insinuating ammo manufacturers are not willing to risk the investment? Then say so and cut your article short.
2[)] I am still not aware of why the DHS requires more ammunition per person per year than the Army does. Mr. Minter's comment about 'Army personnel train for a long list of job responsibilities, many of which have little to do with small arms' insinuates that every one of DHS's personnel carry/use small arms. I guess the American people should feel much better knowing an additional 70,000 DHS agents are armed and trained for any and all contengencies. 
3[)] Last time I looked, Federal Ammunition was owned by ATK. In 2010, ATK was ranked number 31 in the top 100 Contractors of the U.S. Government. I am sure a company who has the majority of their profit coming from the Federal Government will give totally objective statements concerning their primary customer.
4[)] Your reasoning about why demand has 'gone up' is suspect at best and faulty at worst. The lead in statement regarding the increase of women in the shooting sports can only stand if the number of men remains constant. This inormation was noticeably absent. Additionally, your statement about gun ownership increasing, although good for the gun manufacuterers, has extremely little to do with the increase of ammo demand as I believe all NRA members can attest to knowing vast numbers of people who own guns but never shoot them.  
Please read 'Freakenomics' before attempting to use correlation as your foundation of reasoning for your next article.]]>

        <![CDATA[Remember though that when a faction finally removes firearms from a populace; as has been the case time and time again, those with nothing more than the knowledge of firearms are then subjected to removal as well, but I’m glad to see that Ya’ll have more or less the same concerns that I do over the ammo shortage issue; here is my feeble stab at it any way.

I do not believe that the NRA is as nearly short sighted as it seems, and in these trying times that it justly holds the ideals of our founding fathers as TRUTH.

So; maybe Ya’ll can help me reconcile some disconnects that I find in the NRA’s major publication, the AMERICAN RIFLEMAN; especially the January 2014 issue.

Why we’ve had an ammo shortage, P. 84, Frank Minter; for starters, and despite being the 2nd [(]pun intended[)] such AMMO shortage piece in AR in the last year or less; I don’t think it really addresses my [(]OUR[)] fears down here on main street USA; because despite the “numbers and facts behind why you can’t find the cartridges you want” which are all very convincing and RATIONAL; I also read; Jan. 14, Standing GUARD, Halfway Home, P.12, Wayne LaPierre, “But we’re only halfway home, and the next big test begins right now.”; also VERY convincing, with the sense that in the near future we may just may have a 50/50 chance of GUNS & AMMO [(]ask Dick Metcalf[)] or NOT. So; on one hand NRA says supply and demand, but on the other hand NRA says; HEY wake up this is it…. Unless you change things, so what do we THINK; sit around and wait; send more money, or horde ammo, it is a vicious cycle, and I’m [(]we are[)] scared and not at all RATIONAL or soothed.

I ask around and study up on the AMMO issue outside of the NRA’s sphere and find MANY distressing concerns among the GUN culture that I actually live with on a daily basis, and it is VERY disconcerting; primarily because of my perception of the fears and concerns of the un-coached people I talk to and/or read about. “The NRA tells me; supply & demand”, yea; NO that’s NOT it, something else is up MAN, and this is coming in no small part from the employees in the retail outlets that I haunt. I know I don’t have to tell the NRA about the 22 long rifle black-market in the Wal-Marts across the nation, but a BLACK MARKET in ANY LEGAL commodity is indicative of an type of societal break down that is generally seen in dire situations! 

As the NRA very well knows this is AMERICA and as such in this free market economy WE are usually able to rectify supply & demand toot sweet because capitalism works; RIGHT?
Was the ammo industry and the NRA inexplicably caught off guard; kind of like the launch of Obama care? Or could it be that the NRA could not orchestrate a preemptive industrial [(]web design, maybe?[)] strategy that would keep US[(]A[)] in 22lr, unless the NRA IS [(]is NOT[)] in league with the ammo manufacturers to profiteer off uncertain times; given even “IF” 22lr returns it will be around a dime a pop? One Pawn GUN shop owner said to me “did you stop buying milk when it went to $4.79 a gallon? Well then”!!! For those of us trapped outside of the beltway in Washington D.C. ON and ON twirls our [(]just me?[)] thought processes above and beyond supply and demand; so maybe just maybe this will strike a chord; because as so aptly put by Wayne, AR, Dec. 13, P.13, “Bring it on, because Americans – by the millions upon millions – will fight to defend our freedom.”. If and when; what shall be the call sign?
Semper fi

      <comment_content><![CDATA[A young, new shooter usually starts with 22 LR, with his dad or grandad teaching the basics. But that's disappearing quickly, as it's difficult to get youth started in hunting or shooting sports when 22LR is suddenly scarce. Wake up; of *course* the Federal Government is limiting the supply by whatever means they have at their disposal! Recall Eric Holder's 1995 statement: ''What we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people, and make it something that's not cool, that it's not acceptable, it's not hip to carry a gun anymore, in the way in which we changed our attitudes about cigarettes.'' Eric Holder is the Liberal Fascist in charge of the DHS. And you know what's scarier? The GOP isn't so much better than Democrats. Both Parties are in power for power's sake, and desire to CONTROL the unwashed masses is their mutual goal. We are well and truly screwed.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[They say we are hoarding the ammo and so there is not enough to go around. How can we hoard the ammo when they will only sell us 3 boxes? When the retailers get their shipments they get maybe a couple thousand rounds of .22's. If the factories are making billions of rounds there would be way more going to the retailers. If the factory people are trying to help by making more ammo, why are the prices going through the roof? I bought a single box of Hornady 223 plastic tip last week cost me $25.00. Well over a dollar a round that should have been fifty cents a round or less. This was at a Bass Pro. If things were right, and the demand was there, production would increase to meet the demand. Things are not right. The ammo is not being made in the volume they say it is or we would have plenty. Why would DHS need 1300 rounds a year to train each person? No police agency shoots that much ammo for training. Trust me, I know. I think this is just like the farmers crop rotation plan, where the government pays farmers not to plant crops. The government is paying the ammo people not to produce.]]></comment_content>

Nothing of any brand, from .22 BB to .22 Magnum. When money can be made in landslide amounts that could be made right now, the manufacturers would darn well be making the ammo.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Where I live the ammo supply seems to be returning to pretty much normal.  I can get just about whatever I'm looking for.  I did notice that during the crunch, the ammo was flying off the shelves as fast as it was put out, so I don't doubt that had an effect.  As for DHS, it really isn't fair to compare DHS with the military.  That's apples and oranges.  The average soldier in a non-combat MOS may only shoot 50 rounds or so in a year's time.  A 3 second burst from a helicopter minigun can eat up enough ammo for 6 GIs yearly use.  DHS not only has it's own law enforcement officers to provide for, they also operate 3 training centers that provide basic training for every federal agency except FBI, DEA, Border Patrol and Coast Guard, and many of those go to advanced training at a DHS facility as do many state and local officers.  Their contract is for 'UP TO' a certain amount over a 5 year period.  That just makes sure it's available.  They probably won't take actual delivery of that total and they get a better price for a large single vendor contract.  As for some of the comments I've seen about the big bad 'Hollow Point' ammo, even the military uses hollow point ammo on domestic facilities.  Only when they leave the US do they have to carry FMJ, per NATO requirement [(]stupid I think[)].  Federal law enforcement agencies almost across the board carry hollow points and most [(]mine included[)] are REQUIRED to train with the same ammo as they carry on duty. [(]Thank the trial lawyers for that[)]. My agency issues one type of .40 cal ammo, Speer Gold Dot Hollow Points and we cannot use anything else except for approved frangible ammunition for training on steel.  Most fed agencies qualify 4 times a year.  For me that's a minimum of 700 or so rounds just for handgun qualification.  Add in shotgun and rifle , tactical training, specialty training and some others and I go well over 1000 rounds in a year's time.  The specialty team members are even higher.  It's not an unrealistic figure when you take into account what DHS really covers. ]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[I'm not satisfied with any of the author's explanations. Of course they appear feasible but, in a world of capitalism the manufacturers and stockholders should continue making a fortune - yet why is there a severe absence of .22 which historically is THE most affordable ammo to shoot and train with? 

There are only two acceptable explanations...

1. Manufacturers are being paid to a[)] not manufacture or b[)] not ship ammo. 'That's conspiracy theory!' you say, well I say NOT! 
FACT - Our government pays farmers to NOT grow crops! - FACT

2. Local Wally-world stock-boys/girls are hoarding the supplies as shipments are received, and are reselling on Gunbroker at incredible markups.

You decide...]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[While I agree with the idea that there are groups out there that would use creative methods to remove as many guns [(]and ammo[)] from society as possible. We all know that we are not about to give them away.  I think it's possible that economics may be at play with the .22 shortage.  Does anyone know what the most profitable calibers are? I suspect that .22 being the lowest priced ammo means that the margins may not be the best.  The manufacturers are going to ramp up production on the money making stuff first and while they wait to bring up .22 production the price will rise due to demand and therefore make more money for them in the long run.<!--mobile-->]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[There was a fair amount of baloney in Miniter's article.  The proposed DHS buying spree was reportedly 1.6 billion rounds over four to five years, or about three to four hundred million rounds a year.  Those numbers are far higher than DHS purchases of the past few years.

Comparing the DHS ammo usage to the military's is an apples to oranges comparison, but not in the way Miniter thinks.  The military kills people for a living.  DHS agents only rarely have to do so.  Thus the fact that the agents get four or five times the yearly ammo that soldiers do indicates vast overuse and overbuying of ammunition.  The agents' need for practice is hardly greater than that of military members.

What's stranger yet, dum-dum bullets are outlawed by international agreement, but DHS agents carry and use them routinely while the military is prohibited from doing so?  Hollow point ammo flooding to the feds is very much a legitimate concern for American citizens.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[It is absolutely absurd to believe that DHS actually needs 1,600 rounds per person.  Only a small percentage of the people in DHS actually shoot their weapons on a consistent basis.  I'm sure every admin person in these agencies is not shooting all the time and I doubt that even the first line DHS employees shoot that often.  Most law enforcement agencies, just as the military in peacetime, do not shoot that often.  Nothing in this article explains why the DHS is using this much ammo]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[Simple economics here of supply and demand. Manufacturers clearly want more money for their product. Initiate a shortage of supply and jack prices up. It doesn't make sense for the short run, but long run it does- once higher prices are established they are easier to sustain. This article is an excuse.

Everything boils down to money, that's the blood of society.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Government conspiracies....bah humbug.  Lots of ammo out there.  Just not getting to store shelves.  It's getting scooped up in the distribution chain by opportunists.  I can go on gunbroker.com right now and buy a semi truck full of 22lr.  If I want to pay .20-.25 a round.  The ammo is also filling the shelves at price gouging retailers.  Manufactures ship to distributors.  Who the distributors give it to depends on who's willing to pay the most.  Companies like Cheaper Than Dirt or LuckyGunner always have plenty of ammo.  Because they pay the distributors inflated prices to get it and pass those prices on.  500 rd bulk pack of 22lr at Walmart is under $25.  But you have to wait for it.  Want it now?  Plenty to be found at $60-$75 a box.]]></comment_content>

And why if shells are flying off the shelves would the manufacturing companies not make shipments to compensatefor demand...because its intheir best interest not to...dealers either...the more you have to come in looking for ammo just increases the probability you are going to purchase other available items guns and supplies...Greed is the word here...

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I think this is one of the better articles covering the issues on why there is an ammo shortage.  The tax revenue chart is probably the most truthful chart as its not controlled by the ammo industry.  As shooters we all need to stop drinking the corporate COOL AID!  Stop thinking that these CEO's are looking out for you the shooter.  They are in business to make MONEY and right now their industry is in prime time.  With the number one salesman in the White House and the NRA [(]I am a life member[)] stirring the pot as they too are reaping record donations.  Why fulfill the market as that would quell demand the record prices for their goods would go down as would their PROFITS.  Its sad that as old time shooters [(]I've supported these folks for 40 years[)] we are just given lip service of the wrong kind.  These folks are no different then the medical, oil, banking fields....the bottom line is making money the hell with the consumer....and they have us right where they want us....at their mercy.  Its sad but welcome to the new AMERICA. ]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[The Government has their hand in things[(]OBAMA[)] The other thing that is hurting our ammunition is advertisement along with the promoting of competition shooting. Take a look at all the competitive shooters who have sponsors such as'Cheaper Than Dirt' [(]ammo Suppliers[)], Federal, Winchester etc., etc. These suppliers and manufacturers' are going to cater to the competition shooters. Competition shooters shoot thousands of rounds a day and advertise that they do as well as naming their suppliers on tv. I am a sportsman, NRA supporter and shooter as well but when supplies are low everyone should have to cut back so that everyone can continue to do what they love to do within reason. Cheaper Than Dirt is no longer Cheaper than dirt, their prices have doubled and even tripled if you can even get a box of shells from them, but they continue to make sure their competition shooters have plenty of ammo and wear their logo, I bet they even give them a discount!!!!]]></comment_content>

They are taking a toll on our ammo supplies, Cheaper than dirt and such companies advertise ammo sales and sponsor shooters yet there is never any ammo available to the public. Competition shooters waste thousands of rounds every week. If there is a shortage,  Why is there no limit imposed on competition shooting??? .

        <![CDATA[It surprises me how many people this is an Obama conspiracy.  Stop the paranoia.  
Gun sales in the US have gone up dramatically in the past few years.  Conceal carry laws helped drive this.  More guns bought, means greater ammo demand.  Supply and demand are out of equallibrium.   I think the reasons stated in the article why ammo makers are not catching up to supply are spot on.  Once supply catches up to demand, prices will fall.  Of course with the current profit margins being made by the ammo makers, why would they want to catch up with demand any time soon?]]>

      <![CDATA[The M14 rifle was officially adopted in 1957 as a replacement for the M1 rifle that had served our armed forces so well for more than 20 years. The adoption of the M14 rifle and the concurrent procurement of the M60 machine gun resulted in the 7.62x51 mm NATO cartridge becoming the standardized cartridge to replace the .30 Springfield (.30-’06 Sprg.). As events transpired, however, due to production delays and glitches encountered with the new M14, it soon became apparent that the Garand’s tenure of service with the U.S. military was far from over. This led to the obvious question of what the Army was going to do with the .30-cal. Garands in its inventory until M14s became available in sufficient numbers.



The U.S. Army Ordnance Dept. evaluated the relative merits of converting the .30-cal. M1s to fire the new 7.62x51 mm NATO cartridge; a concept not without precedent as the Italian military had previously embarked on a program of converting its .30-cal. Garand rifles to 7.62 mm. The rifles were modified for the Italian government by the venerable firm of Beretta. After a great deal of study, the U.S. Army decided against modifying its M1 rifles to chamber the new NATO round. The U.S. Army and Marine Corps were aware that they would be receiving the new M14s as they came on line, and were content to continue using .30-cal. Garands in the interim.



But the U.S. Navy’s need for small arms was very much secondary to those of the Army and Marines, and it was not certain when, or even if, the Navy would be re-equipped with M14s. Small arms were not a major part of the Navy’s inventory, and obtaining the latest service rifles was not considered a matter of great urgency. Nevertheless, while not among its primary armament priorities, rifles were required by the Navy for equipping landing parties, security/sentry personnel, sailors in basic training and competitive shooting teams.



It was believed that the M1s already in inventory would suffice, but it was deemed prudent to have commonality of ammunition with the M14 to mitigate logistical and supply problems. The logical course of action would be to convert the Navy’s Garands to chamber the now-standard 7.62x51 mm NATO cartridge, the Army’s aversion to that course of action notwithstanding.



Plans were made to devise the best method of modifying the Navy’s M1 rifles. In 1959, $25,000 was appropriated for the project to be carried out by the Naval Ordnance Plant in York, Pa., under the direction of James F. Weller. It was soon concluded that the insertion of a metal chamber bushing or sleeve configured to the 7.62 mm cartridge would be the most expedient method of accomplishing the conversion. In 1962, the Navy engaged the services of the H.P. White Laboratories in Street, Md., to develop a satisfactory bushing. In addition to the chamber bushing insert, the gas port of the barrel had to be enlarged to provide sufficient gas for proper rifle functioning. A plastic magazine spacer or block was developed to prevent the accidental loading of the longer .30-’06 Sprg. cartridges into the shorter 7.62x51 mm NATO chamber. The spacer was attached to the M1’s bullet guide. In 1964, Springfield Armory conducted testing on the Navy’s proposed modification of the M1 rifles to 7.62 mm, which were designated “M1E14.”



Preliminary testing at Springfield revealed the barrel chamber bushings tended to become loose and could be ejected-along with the fired cartridge case-at any given time. In an attempt improve the situation, Loktite was applied to the bushing and several rounds subsequently fired to seat it in the chamber. This proved to be only marginally successful. Despite the generally negative conclusions of the Springfield Armory test report, the Navy proceeded with plans to convert many of its .30-’06 Sprg. M1s to 7.62 mm. Although tested by the Army and Marine Corps, with a few exceptions (mentioned below), the .30-’06 Sprg. Garands converted to 7.62 mm were modified under the auspices of the U.S. Navy.



When a Garand was converted to 7.62 mm configuration by the Navy, the rifle was no longer classified as an M1 and was given new nomenclature. As was the Navy’s policy regarding all manner of equipment, not just arms, “MK” (Mark) and “MOD” (Model) numbers were assigned to the converted rifles. For example, the Garand rifles converted to 7.62 mm by means of a barrel bushing were designated as MK 2 – MOD 0” (Mark 2, Model Zero). The later rifles with newly made 7.62 mm barrels installed were the “MK 2 – MOD 1” (Mark 2, Model One).



<strong>MK 2 MOD 0 Rifles      </strong>

The Navy entered into a contract with the American Machine and Foundry (AMF) of York, Pa., to convert rifles to 7.62 mm, and in it these rifles were referred to as “Rifle, M1 Caliber 7.62 mm Conversion.” Once they were converted to 7.62 mm, they lost the M1 nomenclature and were officially MK 2 MOD 0 rifles. The first (approximately) 100 rifles converted were inscribed “7.62 NATO” on the left side of their receivers, but this <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/N01-HR-Mod1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-26781" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="N01 HR Mod1" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/N01-HR-Mod1.jpg" alt="" width="508" height="271" /></a>designation was soon moved to the right side of the barrel. The initial AMF contract called for 15,050 Garands to be converted, many of which were World War II production rifles. The firm subsequently received another contract to convert an additional 10,000 rifles. In order to augment AMF’s conversion program, the Navy also granted a contract to Harrington &amp; Richardson Arms Co. These rifles were typically stamped “H&amp;R” on the barrel when converted to 7.62 mm.



The problem with bushings coming loose and ejecting from the rifle continued to plague the MK 2 MOD 0 Garands. To alleviate the situation, the Naval Weapons Facility at Crane, Ind., proposed cutting grooves in the chamber to better retain the bushing. While an improvement, the grooved chamber did not totally eliminate the problem.



<strong>MK 2 MOD 1 Rifles      </strong>

It eventually became apparent that the best course of action would be to manufacture new barrels chambered for the 7.62 mm cartridge. It would be a relatively simple matter to remove the old .30-’06 Sprg. barrels and install the new 7.62 mm barrels. While more expensive, the new barrels would eliminate the need for the troublesome chamber bushings. Rifles converted by the installation of a new 7.62 mm barrel were designated by the Navy as the “MK 2 MOD 1” (Mark 2, Model One).



Clearly, the purpose-made 7.62 mm barrel was the better choice, and the sensible decision was made to stop using the bushing method and procure new barrels instead. In 1964, the U.S. Navy contracted with Springfield Armory for the manufacture of 30,000 new Garand barrels chambered for the 7.62x51 mm NATO cartridge. The barrels were manufactured in 1965 and 1966. Only about 5,000 of the 17,050 rifles converted by AMF were the later MK 2 MOD 1 variant (fitted with new Springfield 7.62 mm barrels). Of the 15,000 rifles converted by Harrington &amp; Richardson, only some 25 percent were of MK 2 MOD 1 configuration while the rest of the rifles modified by the firm were of the MK 2 MOD 0 (sleeved chamber) variety. As can be seen, MK 2 MOD 0 rifles were fabricated in significantly larger numbers than the later MK2 MOD 1s.



There were three variations of MK 2 MOD 1 rifles. The first was the standard-grade service rifle assigned the Navy stock number 1005-00-923-9070. Other than the 7.62 mm barrel and the white plastic spacer attached to the bullet guide (which required the stock to be slightly routed out on the inside to accommodate the spacer), the rifles were little different from any other post-World War II arsenal-overhauled Garand. A number of them have been awarded as trophy rifles to participants in Navy-sponsored shooting matches. A U.S. Navy manual states that: “Award trophy rifles in the name of the Secretary of the Navy to Naval personnel for superior performance in authorized matches.”



<strong>MK 2 MOD 1 Grade “A” Match Rifles    </strong>

Until 1999, the highest level of trophy rifle typically awarded for Navy matches was the bolt-action .30-’06 Sprg. Remington Model 720 (May 2001, p. 60). A number of these attractive rifles were left over from World War II and were highly prized by the recipients. When the supply of the Model 720 rifles was exhausted, the Navy MK 2 MOD 1 “Grade A” Match rifles were substituted.



The MK 2 MOD 1 rifles accurized by U.S. Navy ordnance facilities for match competition are interesting variations of the genre. When the rifles were “tuned up,” not all of the accurized rifles were of the same quality. Those that proved to have the best accuracy and overall performance were designated as “Mark 2 Mod. 1 Grade A” rifles. The Navy’s method of selecting the different grades began when the rifles were match-conditioned. After being fired for both function and accuracy, they were divided in to “Grade A” and “Grade B” groups based on accuracy specifications. The letter “A” or “B” was stamped on the bottom of each rifle’s pistol grip. On the Grade A rifles, the last four digits of the rifle’s serial number were also often stamped above the letter marking.



The very exacting specifications for the Grade A rifles resulted in precious few reaching that lofty designation. Only about 10 percent of the accurized rifles were of sufficient quality to warrant the Grade A designation, which obviously made that variant the most uncommon of the Navy Trophy rifles. Of the extant match-conditioned rifles on hand when the U.S. Navy enacted serial number control procedures in the early 1970s, it is reported that out of 1,869 rifles accurized by the Navy, only 84 met the stringent Grade A accuracy standards. The remaining 1,785 rifles were relegated to the Grade B category. There is no way to determine how many rifles may have been accurized and subsequently scrapped prior to the institution of the serial number control system by the Navy. In any event, genuine MK 2 MOD 1 Grade A rifles are very uncommon and highly prized arms today.



<strong>MK 2 MOD 1 Grade “B” Match Rifles    </strong>

Even though the MK 2 MOD 1 Grade B rifles didn’t measure up to the exacting standards of the Grade As, they were still very accurate rifles. Other than the letter on the bottom of the pistol grip, the only readily discernable difference between the Grade A and Grade B rifles was the one-minute adjustable rear sights. The Grade B rifles were typically assembled using a variety of parts from different manufacturers and of different vintages. Stocks and handguards could be walnut, birch or a combination. The MK 2 MOD 1 rifles are no longer used by the Navy for competitive shooting as they were superseded by match-conditioned M14 rifles.



Other than the match-conditioned rifles, the Navy apparently made little use of its 7.62 mm Garands. As stated by former Navy officer and 7.62 mm Garand scholar Jim Adell: “I was on active duty from 1963 to 1972 and didn’t see any 7.62 mm M1 rifles except match conditioned ones. While I was never a Weapons Officer on a ship (after a six-month Navy school qualified me to be a Weapons Officer Department Head, Engineering Officer Department Head and an Operations Officer Department Head), I was the person on my ships that conducted small arms training and qualifications. ... [However], a long-time friend (a Quartermaster) said that he remembers his ship had [7.62 mm Garands] … I know that the ships I served on had only cal. .30 M1s.”



Adell also reported that “the only definite use of the 7.62 mm standard grade rifles that has been documented was that about 500 were transferred to the Naval Training Center in San Diego, Calif., to be used to train recruits going through boot camp.”



Colonel Robert H. Rankin, USMC (Ret.) stated in his book, Small Arms of the Sea Services, that some of the converted Garands were issued by the Navy to shipboard guards, sentries and landing parties. However, as confirmed by Adell, other than limited training use, the converted 7.62 mm Garands were utilized by the Navy primarily for match competition and as trophy rifle awards. It should also be remembered that not all of the M1s in the Navy’s inventory were converted to 7.62 mm configuration, and a number of unaltered .30-’06 Garands continued in Naval service until being replaced by M14s and, later, M16s.



In some instances, the Navy’s transition from Garands to the newer rifles did not go as smoothly as might be imagined. As related by Adell: “As a drilling reservist, I spent the last week of August 1973 aboard … the U.S.S. Joseph Hewes (DE 1078) … [and] witnessed the flap of converting from the M1 to the M14. The story was that the Marines were forced to choose the M16 as their weapon and get rid of the M14s. To save the M14s, they were transferred to the Navy. My experience was that the ship (Nuclear capable) had M14s and a magazine full of cal.-.30 ammo but no 7.62 mm ammo. It should be pointed out that the transfer of M14s from the Marine Corps to the Navy was not limited to this one ship, but was universal throughout both branches of the service.”



After the rifles were retired from the Navy’s inventory, the Civilian Marksmanship Program sold a number of MK 2 MOD 0 and MK 2 MOD 1 barreled receivers (not complete rifles) in 2012 and 2013 to qualified civilian purchasers.



<strong>Other 7.62 mm Military Match Rifles</strong>

While the vast majority of the Garands converted to 7.62 mm under government auspices was done by the U.S. Navy, other branches of the service also fabricated some match rifles chambered for the NATO cartridge. These included the following:



<strong>U.S. Air Force Match Rifles</strong>

The Air Force built a number of match rifles in both 7.62 mm and .30-’06 Sprg. configuration. They were “worked over” by U.S. Air Force armorers for use in competitive shooting. One of the hallmarks of these arms are the initials AFPG, signifying “Air Force Premium Grade,” stamped on the barrels.



<strong>U.S. Marine Corps Match Rifles</strong>

The Marines fabricated limited numbers of 7.62 mm Garand match rifles. The modifications performed on these rifles could include the use of NM sights, glass bedding, permanently attaching the lower bands to the front handguards, as well as polishing the barrels and operating rods. Some of the USMC match rifles had all of these modifications done while others had only a few. The unit armorer that performed the match tuning typically had his own ideas on how to modify the rifles, which resulted in a wide variation of features in such rifles.



<strong>Secretary Of The Navy Rifles</strong>

From the late 1950s well into the 1970s, a number of M1 rifles were given to winners of various military matches, such as the Navy’s East/West Coast Fleet Matches and similar events as trophy rifles. Most of these were not made as, or intended to be, match-grade rifles but were simply given as awards to winners or runners-up of the matches. Some were standard service rifles, and others were rifles that had subsequently been assembled from miscellaneous parts-even some M14 parts that were interchangeable with M1 components.



Even though the M1 rifle’s days were numbered after the adoption of the M14, the old workhorse Garand continued to serve this nation well for a couple more decades. There are many interesting variations of the M1 and the rifles converted to 7.62 mm in the post-war period are among the more interesting and least known examples of the genre. They are further testimony to the genius that went into John Garand’s masterpiece.]]>

      <![CDATA[Currently, there are two divergent beliefs concerning defensive handgun ammunition; some armed citizens desire ammunition capable of satisfactorily completing the entire battery of barrier tests prescribed by the “FBI protocol,” whereas others want a reduced-penetration option to minimize the risk of collateral damage. Whichever is the most applicable to you, the personal-protection practitioner, depends upon your target-engagement philosophy and the circumstances in which you forecast the threat would most likely occur. Some considerations are: your definition of “self-defense,” and the actions you’re willing to take to neutralize a threat; potential barriers (both inside and outside the home, and behind which an assailant could take cover); location and proximity of family members, neighbors or bystanders; backstops (or lack thereof); and temperature/season (thin or thick garments). It’s only after carefully considering each of the aforementioned categories that you can subscribe to a specific philosophy and make an informed decision regarding the corresponding ammunition. A change in any of the categories could also dictate exchanging your defensive load. Why?



The reality is that, to date, there is no conventional personal-protection projectile available to “civilians” that performs optimally “across the board”; a bullet that is intended to maintain its integrity-for sufficient penetration-even when encountering difficult-to-defeat barriers, such as automobile glass, cannot be expected to exhibit the same traits as one designed to expend most of its energy in a soft target, even wallboard, to reduce damage from over-penetration or a miss. As such, it’s prudent for an ammunition company to offer multiple loads with distinct performance parameters. That’s exactly what Federal Premium did with HST and Guard Dog Home Defense.



<strong>HST</strong>

Representative of the contemporary trend in personal-protection ammunition, Federal Premium HST was available only to law enforcement personnel since its inception in 2002; however, in 2013 the company decided to make it available to consumers. I equate it to the open-market sales of “special” estrous deer urine previously provided only to “industry insiders.” As with the urine distributors, Federal Premium and other ammunition manufacturers understand the significant consumer demand for the same products that the “experts,” in this case, law enforcement agencies, are using in the field. With this, the company surely noted the increased presence of competitive consumer products that were formerly law-enforcement-only loads. Such loads upped the ante with regard to terminal performance in the FBI protocol testing, and shed light on Federal’s own aging representative in the “premium” personal-defense load category-Hydra-Shok.



After the infamous “Miami Shootout” on April 11, 1986, the call went out for a handgun bullet with markedly better terminal ballistics than provided by the traditional cup-and-core projectiles the FBI was using at the time. Federal’s response was the Hydra-Shok, which was unveiled in 1988. A non-bonded bullet, Hydra-Shok has skives in its gilding metal jacket that, along with the trademark post centering the cavity, “preprogramed” expansion so that the end result was a slug 11/2 times original diameter with six equal petals. Typical weight retention was 75 percent of the projectile’s pre-expansion weight, which, when combined with the post-expansion diameter, resulted in respectable penetration-even after defeating several types of barriers. Numerous police agencies still use Hydra-Shok, which is a testament to the projectile’s design and effectiveness. That being said, the projectile is not perfect. As with many other hollow-point bullets, Hydra-Shok’s cavity is susceptible to clogging, especially when impacting at low velocities, which effectively makes it behave like a full-metal-jacket projectile-minimal, if any, expansion resulting in reduced energy dispersion and excessive penetration. Such performance is neither desirable in FBI protocol testing nor “in the field”; hence the reason HST was created.



According to a “frequently asked questions” (FAQs) page on the Federal’s website, HST was the result of governmental and law enforcement agencies contacting the company “requesting a bullet that had a larger frontal expansion diameter without sacrificing penetration.” Additionally,  it states that Federal “sought to improve performance through intermediate barriers while improving the scores attained through the FBI barriers.” Concerning “scores,” companies vying for the coveted FBI contract must submit a specified quantity of ammunition that will be run through the agency’s rigorous testing-the results of which are also consulted by smaller law enforcement agencies with insufficient internal testing capabilities. Points are lost for not consistently attaining penetration depths between 12 inches and 18 inches in 10-percent ballistic gelatin, after defeating the prescribed barriers (except in the bare gelatin test). In fact, the Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation Request for Proposal Number RFP0193025 explicitly calls for results of, “… no shot less than 12 inches and no shot greater than 18 inches.” Points can also be lost if the projectile doesn’t “expand to at least twice its original diameter” and “retain all of its [pre-expansion] weight,” among other requirements. A projectile that failed to expand and over-penetrated would be heavily penalized. These criteria certainly informed the jacketed hollow point design of the HST.



The developmental phase of HST began in 2000, and two years later it was presented to <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gel.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-26787" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="gel" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gel.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="579" /></a>the law enforcement community-more than a decade after Hydra-Shok was first fielded. In creating HST, the company addressed the Hydra-Shok’s weaknesses in unique ways. For example, company literature reports that “the petals created by skiving [co-aligned, internal and external] result in large diameters across the ‘peaks’ of the upset, yet also create ‘valleys’ between the peaks. These valleys and peaks effectively create a larger diameter upset with a smaller cross-section or footprint which allows deeper penetration over a more conventional ‘round’-type upset at the same diameter.” The sharp edges of the six equal petals certainly enhance penetration, too. Typical expansion diameters are 1.75 to 2 times the bullet’s original width. “HST bullets result in larger expanded diameters than Hydra-Shok; the larger upsets lead to consistent penetration (but not over-penetration) and a large wound channel,” said Dan Compton, Federal Premium Ammunition product line specialist. To ensure expansion, even when penetrating barriers that typically clog a hollow-point, Compton reported that the company, “weaken[s] the nose to make it more forgiving when fired through barriers.”



As with Hydra-Shok, HST is a non-bonded bullet; it relies on a mechanical lock-cannelure-to prevent jacket-core separation. Bonding requires a “soft” lead core that is prone to material “washing off” when encountering barriers such as automobile glass, and can lead to expansion diameters that reduce penetration, so that process wasn’t used. Weight retention figures are dependent on the barrier encountered; however, 95 to 100 percent is average. Additionally, HST loads feature low-flash propellants and nickel-plated cases, the latter contributes to smoother feeding, corrosion resistance and easier chamber checks in low-light conditions.



While filming several episodes for “American Rifleman Television” at Federal Premium’s Anoka, Minn., ammunition plant, I had an opportunity to witness the results of the 230-grain, .45 Auto HST load-fired from a Glock 21-when put to the test against the various barriers as outlined by the FBI protocol. The first test, fired at 10 feet, was into bare gelatin. The bullet, which penetrated about 13¾ inches of the medium, expanded to 0.922 inches and had a recovered weight of 230.5 grains. When encountering denim, the projectile penetrated to depth of 13 inches, weighed 230.1 grains and measured 0.813 inches at its widest (material was trapped in its cavity). All subsequent tests had the bullet penetrate a primary barrier (or barriers) before encountering the denim-cloaked gelatin block. After impacting wallboard (two pieces), the HST bored about 12 inches deep into the gelatin. It weighed 230.1 grains and measured 0.861 inches wide. After striking two pieces of 20-gauge, hot-rolled sheet steel, the bullet stopped 177⁄8 inches into the gelatin, where its recovered weight and diameter were 229.9 grains and 0.498 inches, respectively.



We then tested the bullet against a 3/4-inch thick piece of AA fir plywood; this test is deceptively difficult as the glue and wood particulate combines to clog many hollow-point bullets, thus handicapping terminal performance. After defeating the plywood the HST pierced 14¼ inches of gelatin. It weighed 230.6 grains and measured 0.844 inches, though expansion wasn’t uniform. The most difficult test was saved for last. Shooting through one piece of AS1, 1/4-inch thick laminated automobile glass at a 45-degree angle to horizontal, the HST still penetrated 11½ inches, and the recovered projectile weighed 219.9 grain and was 0.803 inches at its widest. “The bullet was never designed to be a true glass-defeating bullet although it consistently performs well in this area, too,” said Compton. I agree.



Furthering testing, this time with the 124-grain, 9 mm Luger Personal Defense load, demonstrated the ammunition to be both accurate and consistent. Fired from a Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P9L C.O.R.E. topped with a Leupold Delta Point at 25 yards, the average for five consecutive, five-shot groups was 2.54 inches, and the standard deviation for 10 shots was a very respectable 10. From the C.O.R.E.’s 5-inch barrel the load averaged 1168 f.p.s, resulting in 376 foot-pounds of energy.



Although Federal has 11 HST loads listed in a range of calibers for law enforcement, it’s currently only offering three for commercial sale: a 124-grain, 9 mm Luger, 180-grain, .40 S&amp;W, and a 230-grain, .45 Auto, with the suggested retail prices being $30.95, $33.95 and $33.95, respectively, for 20 cartridges.



For those personal-protection practitioners who want their carry and home-defense ammunition to perform as well as that used by law enforcement agencies such San Diego, Calif., Phoenix, Ariz., Riverside County, Calif., Orange County, Calif., and Portland, Ore., to name a few, as well as require that their load excel in the “FBI protocol” testing, Federal Premium Personal Defense HST gets the nod. For all others, read on.



<strong>Guard Dog</strong>

In 2001, Federal Premium brought to market unique law enforcement and civilian loads with the counterintuitive name “expanding full metal jacket” (EFMJ). Among the problems that EFMJ projectiles solved was over-penetration and collateral damage due to clogged, non-expanding hollow points and misses, respectively; remember, EFMJ was created in the same period in which HST was being developed, and solved the same dilemma. How so? Outwardly, the projectiles mimicked the appearance of a traditional, non-exposed lead flat-nose bullet; however, beneath the surface they were anything but conventional. Upon impact, the bullet’s gilding metal jacket, which is skived to strategically weaken it, pushes downward, and in doing so it compresses the rubber insert, forcing the elastic material outward and aiding expansion. Interestingly, the lead core of the exposed base slips forward upon impact, further “squishing” the rubber. Because the EFMJ doesn’t have a hollow cavity to clog, nor is a hydraulic effect required for upset, reliable expansion is assured. Expanded EFMJs have six distinctive and unique petals between which the rubber material juts outward. Large expansion diameters, typically 1.5- to 1.75- times the original diameter, combined with a true mushroom shape, few exposed sharp edges and light bullet weights, serve to reduce penetration (see p. 82). This is an important consideration if multiple family members are dispersed within a dwelling, or where neighbors are quite close, such as in a condominium or a townhouse. That being said, EFMJs penetrate soft targets sufficiently to maximize terminal effects.



Although early promotional literature illustrated the law enforcement variant’s expansion diameters, retained weights and penetration depths after encountering the various FBI

protocol-prescribed barriers, EFMJs in the Personal Defense line were not marketed as, nor created for, being capable of defeating barriers beyond clothing, drywall and, to a certain extent, plywood; in fact, EFMJ is optimized for defeating clothing and, due to its expanded shape and diameter, energy levels quickly lessened to reduce penetration. Interestingly, whereas the law enforcement EFMJ loads featured bullet weights comparable to standard ammunition, such as 124-grain, 9 mm Luger +P, 165-grain, .40 S&amp;W, and 200-grain, .45 Auto, those destined for the civilian market were considerably lighter; the 9 mm Luger featured a 105-grain projectile, the .40 S&amp;W had a 135-grain bullet, and .45 Auto was loaded with a 165-grain variant.



Three years ago, Federal Premium discontinued the Personal Protection EFMJ line and replaced it with the improved version coined “Guard Dog.” Few things have changed; structurally and performance-wise, Guard Dog mimics EFMJ, but there are subtle differences that are noteworthy. Perhaps the most obvious change is nickel-plating. On the EFMJ, only the case was plated but Guard Dog projectiles receive the process, too. Why? “Nickel plating assists in minimizing oxidation on the bullet and case,” explained Compton. More important though, “nickel plating is a visual indicator that the round is an EFMJ and not a standard FMJ.” That is certainly invaluable information for a defensive situation. Internally, the most obvious change is the color of the rubber, which is now brilliant blue; in a life-or-death situation, though, that’s probably the least important consideration. Terminal performance is what counts, so while on-site at Federal Ammunition in Anoka, I pitted Guard Dog against several barriers that might be encountered inside the home and defeated to stop a threat. The results were eye-opening.



The first test was bare gelatin at 10 feet using the 105-grain load fired from a 3.46-inch barreled Glock Model 26. The bullet, which had a recovered weight and expansion diameter of 105.2 grains and 0.595 inches, respectively, penetrated 9¼ inches into the ballistic gelatin. In the subsequent test, which was heavy clothing (denim), the bullet pierced through approximately 9¾ inches of gelatin, with the recovered projectile weighing 105.5 grains (some denim was trapped on the bullet) and measured 0.601-inches wide. In the final test, which was drywall, the bullet bored through 12¼ inches of gelatin; however, the bullet’s expansion characteristics were atypical of Guard Dog in the previous tests. Appearing that it yawed as it entered the wallboard, the bullet literally ripped open, shedding its rubber insert; as such, it weighed 99.5 grains and measured 0.464-inches wide. Federal Premium personnel were as surprised by the results as I was. Despite not exhibiting “picture-perfect” performance, the last load still did well as there was no doubt what the terminal effects would have been. When chronographing 165-grain .45 Auto Guard Dog at a local, private range, I placed a target on two, 3/4"-thick pieces of plywood as an aiming reference, and after shooting I recovered one of the projectiles in the backstop; it exhibited picture-perfect expansion, so I think drywall test results encountered in Anoka were more of a fluke than anything else. Regardless, they occurred.



I accuracy tested the same load through a Commander-size Ruger SR1911. At 25 yards, the average for five consecutive, five-shot groups was 4.72 inches; had I used a bench-mounted Ransom Rest, the groups would likely have tightened considerably. As for velocity, the average for five consecutive shots was 1047 f.p.s.-with a standard deviation of 13-resulting in 402 feet-pounds of energy. There were two failures to feed; however, after lubricating the pistol no further issues were encountered. Something worthwhile to note is that, even with a full propellant charge, due to the lightweight bullet recoil is noticeably less than standard 230-grain loads.



Guard Dog is currently offered in the same chamberings and bullet weights as was Personal Defense EFMJ; that is, 105-grain, 9 mm Luger, 135-grain, .40 S&amp;W and 165-grain, .45 Auto. The prices are $29.95, $31.95, and $32.95, respectively, for a 20-count box.



Through the manipulation of metals, Federal Premium’s engineers have created loads custom-tailored to fulfill the distinct needs demanded by opposing views of personal-protection ammunition. Whichever philosophy you subscribe to, with HST and Guard Dog Federal Premium has you covered.

O RLY?  I'd really like to see anyone and everyone defend this allegation but ONLY if you use statistics and verifiable fact, and NOT just parroting the same 'common sense' that everyone, including me, has all heard and can intuitively judge to appear reasonable.  In other words, don't waste everyone's time by pointing out that a bullet that doesn't stop inside the target will continue to travel downrange and can *theoretically* strike a third party.  Show me statistics or even some anecdotal evidence that this has *actually* *happened*.  And if/when anyone does accomplish this task, *then* consider the odds of it happening considering how much effort it took to scrape up one example of it happening, compared to the thousands/tens of thousands of examples of targets getting shot inside houses occupied by third parties or with occupied condominiums/townhouses nearby. ]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Well, would you believe the FBI when it comes to statistics on over-penetration? 'The fear of over-penetration is a misconception, which was created back when law enforcement was trying to overcome misinformed public resistance to the use of hollow point ammunition. In the process, we began to believe it ourselves. First, our lawyers are unaware of any successful legal action resulting from the injury of a bystander due to a round over-penetrating the subject. We are aware of numerous instances of Agents/officers being killed because their round did not penetrate enough. Further, if you examine shooting statistics you will see that officers hit the subject somewhere around 20-30[%] of the time. Thus 70-80[%] of the shots fired never hit their intended target and nobody ever worries about them – only the ones that might 'over-penetrate' the bad guy. Third, as our testing shows, even the most frangible bullets designed specifically for shallow penetration will plug up when striking wood or wallboard and then penetrate like full metal jacketed ammunition. We are aware of successful legal actions where an innocent party has been struck by a shot passing through a wall, but as we have proven, ALL of them will do that. Also, a bullet that completely penetrates a subject will give up a great deal of energy doing so. The skin on the exit side of the body is tough and flexible. Experiments have shown that it has the same resistance to bullet passage as approximately four inches of muscle tissue.' I would suggest that your number one priority is to put the bad guy down with one shot and that requires a powerful cartridge, deep penetration, and a very large hole. To get into a gunfight with a wimpy cartridge and then try to make up for it with a high-capacity magazine is only going to result in you and the still-standing bad guy spraying bullets all over the place, increasing the odds that some of them will get out of the room. Want to protect the neighbors? End the fight quickly.]]></comment_content>

      <![CDATA[Pistol-caliber submachine guns and carbines have become de-emphasized somewhat in military and law enforcement circles for want of firearms chambered in more powerful rifle cartridges, such as the 5.56x45 mm NATO. While this trend toward intermediate rifle rounds has undoubtedly been a good move for the military, more power is not always needed or desired in every civilian application. The Just Right Carbine is a U.S.-made, pistol-caliber carbine that effectively bridges the broad power gap between long guns chambered for rimfire cartridges and those using bottleneck rifle rounds. This modular firearm is chambered in 9 mm Luger, .40 S&amp;W and .45 ACP, and each carbine is interchangeable between all three calibers.



At first glance, the JR Carbine is just another AR variant. Though it shares numerous parts and an outward appearance with the ubiquitous AR platform, the JR is actually of a totally different design. Unlike the AR’s gas-operated action, the JR Carbine uses a simple blowback system similar to that of the Ruger 10/22. The bolt is held forward by spring pressure and is cycled by the energy of the fired round; there are no gas tubes or pistons involved. While it doesn’t use the AR’s operating system, the JR Carbine does share with the AR its modularity and some parts commonality, so many of the myriad of AR accessories can be used on the JR. The carbine uses a standard commercial diameter AR buffer tube so any buttstock compatible with a commercial AR can be fitted to the JR. The buffer itself is not interchangeable with standard AR buffers as the JR uses an extra heavy buffer to counter the inertia of the blowback design. Mil-spec and commercial AR parts are also interchangeable with the carbine’s AR-style trigger, grip, and safety, as well as any accessories that mount to the Picatinny rail such as auxiliary iron sights, scope mounts or lights. This carbine comes ready to accessorize.



Operation of the JR Carbine is straightforward and similar to most traditional semi-automatic firearms. It uses standard cartridge-appropriate Glock pistol magazines (and, in certain models, M1911 magazines) that are inserted into the magazine well forward of the triggerguard. The carbine relies on the magazine catch to hold the magazine at the proper position so it is important not to slam the magazine into the firearm as that can lead to the magazine overriding the catch and causing malfunctions. The side-mounted charging handle is pulled to the rear and released to chamber a round.



The JR uses an AR-style manual safety on its left side, which is disengaged by moving the lever clockwise to the 12 o’clock “FIRE” position. The 6-pound, 8-ounce single-stage trigger is a standard AR model and works like any other semi-automatic. A bolt-mounted extractor and receiver-mounted ejector expend empty cases horizontally through the reversible ejection port just aft of the chamber. The bolt does not automatically lock to the rear on an empty magazine; however, the charging handle can be locked downward into a bolt catch cutout in the charging handle slot.



Disassembly of the JR Carbine for cleaning is a bit more involved than most long guns on the market, and requires a few specific tools to accomplish. Starting with an unloaded firearm with the bolt in the forward position, the buffer tube nut must be loosened using an AR-style stock wrench. The receiver plate is then slid away from the receiver to allow the buffer tube/stock assembly to rotate and the tube assembly is turned counter-clockwise until it can be removed from the receiver. The bolt is then moved to the rear and an Allen-screw inside the bolt handle is removed. With the bolt handle out, the bolt can be removed from the rear of the receiver, which allows access to the breech. If barrel removal is desired, the quad-rail/handguard must be removed using the appropriate spanner wrench before the barrel can be unscrewed using an AR-barrel wrench. It is not necessary to remove the barrel in order to clean it from the breech end as it can be cleaned through the rear of the receiver. At this stage in the disassembly process, changing calibers can be accomplished by changing the barrel, bolt, magazine well, and magazine. Helpful “how to” videos are available on the company’s website.



Unlike most semi-automatic rifles or carbines, the JR is almost fully ambidextrous. The charging handle, ejection port, and magazine release are reversible for right or left-hand operation. Like the basic disassembly steps, this process requires the use of tools and is somewhat involved, but it shouldn’t require professional help for anyone who is reasonably handy and can follow instructions.



Shooting the JR Carbine was enjoyable. It was accurate and both recoil and muzzle blast <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/aff4hj.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-26800" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="aff4hj" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/aff4hj.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="220" /></a>were virtually non-existent despite using full-power and +P ammunition. Our 9 mm test carbine functioned with 100 percent reliability using a 17-round Glock magazine and three different brands of ammunition, including hollow-points. Accuracy from the bench was excellent and rapid hits on offhand targets were made easy with the use of a low-power optic. The dipped pink, purple, and white “Muddy Girl” camo pattern featured on our test model gave the carbine a unique look. The barrel is threaded for flash suppressors available from the manufacturer; unfortunately the threads do not match the most common threads for sound suppressors, which would make a great accessory for this carbine.



Given the JR Carbine’s light weight, adjustable length-of-pull, and minimal recoil, it would be a great intermediate gun for inexperienced shooters looking to graduate from the rimfire power level. The JR Carbine is also a perfectly legitimate home-defense firearm, especially if equipped with a quality red-dot optic and a light. The JR Carbine is a unique, functional, and compact firearm that is fun to shoot. It fills an un-crowded niche in an otherwise crowded carbine market.

        <![CDATA[Your article on the 'Just Right Carbine' concluded with 'It fills an un-crowded niche in an otherwise crowded carbine market'. 

I have nothing against the weapon that you tested, but, I can find no mention in your archives about the Hi-Point carbine series, which are also produced in 9mm, .40 cal., and .45 cal. [(]rated +P[)], and seem to fill that same 'niche' that you describe. I own a 995 TS carbine, and I find it a pleasure to shoot. It has sufficient Picatinny rails to mount any accessory that you might desire. It also costs less than half the price of the JR carbine, even when packaged with additional accessories. Finally, it is also Made In The USA. My only complaint is that I would prefer more magazine capacity. However, that restriction was caused by having to conform to previous 'assault weapon' ban. A Glock-style 50-round drum would make it perfect [(]IMHO[)].

Have you considered testing weapons, such as the Hi-Point carbines, that appeal to someone with a more limited budget?

Kind regards,

Stuart Nuss]]>

        <![CDATA[When I first heard of this carbine I was so excited I did not do my research before dumping/throwing away my $720 hard earned money. I got it to the range, I was proud to have it and it turned out to be a huge embarrassing trip, this piece of crap was a major jamming pos.

I quickly found out that jr carbine does not return emails but they do answer the phones, the lady was nice and I am sure she gets the crap from thousands of owners. I told her my problem and was polite to her because she didn't make the thing and she even offered to send a pickup ticket so shipping would not have cost me anything. She told me I could send it in or just send in the parts I thought was the problem and she would send me new parts on their dime. Long story short I finally fixed it thank me, no more jams and this thing ejects spent shells like a glock. Those of you that are having problems which no doubt is 99[%] of the owners know how great that is. I fixed this 'was' a piece of junk, now a fantastic firearm, just as dependable as a glock. I know just about every owner is mad about their jr carbine, it is a rifle that you want to love but the jams take over and you sell it to a person like me that just love the looks. I am not going to tell how and what I did because jr carbine still has not been able to figure it out and they have people with college degrees making the big bucks working there that cannot figure it out. I am not going to disclose the fix because jrc is not paying me for fixing their piece of junk and turning it into a fantastic weapon, sorry. My serial # starts with a jrcv04xxxx. If you see serial #'s like so it is a jamming firearm. The first serials start with just a jr and the jrcv's are the second generation 'I believe' of this fine rifle. I really enjoy this now, I will post a YouTube video in the near future to show how it spits out the spent shells and no jams. I am even considering a bump-fire stock something I know other owners will not even think about. Tell the jrc people when you call and complain about your jamomatic that I fixed it and why can they not do it as well. 

happy shooting.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I have a Hi-Point 995 and a JR Carbine 9mm.  Both perform flawlessly.  I prefer the JR because it shares my Glock  17 and 19 mags, it uses many standard AR-15 parts and I made it into a lefty in about 40 minutes.  They are both fine firearms.   I also just bought a Hi-Point c9 pistol and it has went through everything from Winchester to Federal to Wolf ammo without a failure...impressive for $170.00]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I am not sure of the selling price of the JRC.  But for $774 I could buy:  an entry level AR; an AK; 2 SKS's; 2 Hi Point TS995's plus accessories; at least 2 home defense type shotguns.  Or as I did, an SKS with both original and replacement furniture and magazines, and a new Hi Point TS 995 plus extra mags, muzzle brake, and laser.  OK, I don't get sub 1 inch groups, but I fire off hand and am not an expert.  Just not worth $774 no matter how you slice it.]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[I really do not understand the negativity thrown at the JR Carbine.  Sure, the original models in 45ACP in particular had failure to feed issues, but JRC corrected them.  I have owned a JR Carbine in 45ACP for two years and have put over 2500 rounds through it of various brands, mostly my own reloads with 185gr lead SWC.  Three failures to feed on the first day on the range, and 100[%] reliability ever since the first cleaning.

It is the perfect companion to my Glock 21 and 30.

    <title>Weaver Kaspa Tactical 2.5-10X 44 MM</title>

      <![CDATA[Today’s optics designed for precision tactical use offer outstanding quality and seemingly endless options, but few can be described as value-priced. <a href="http://weaveroptics.com/" target="_blank">Weaver’s Kaspa Tactical Series 2.5-10X 44 mm Mil-Dot</a> is an exception, offering numerous features usually found on pricier scopes at a cost that many shooters will find attractive.



The Kaspa’s 2.5-10X magnification puts this optic in a very useful power range for general target use as well as most hunting situations and even moderately long-range target work. Though many shooters feel that they need copious amounts of magnification for long-range shooting, 10X is plenty of power for targets out to 800-1000 yards. One criticism of many “tactical” scopes on the market is their enormous size and weight. With an overall length of just under 13 inches and a weight of 1 pound, 9 ounces, the Kaspa isn’t a huge scope nor is it unreasonably heavy. More than 3-inches of eye relief means that this optic can be used on rifles with noticeable recoil without undue risk of the scope making contact with the shooter’s face. Size- and capability-wise, this optic would be right at home on a .308 Win. bolt-action or on a modern sporting rifle set up for precision shooting. For testing, we mounted the Kaspa to an AR-10 style carbine chambered in .308 Win., and the scope’s size was a perfect balance for the overall package.



All scopes in the Kaspa Tactical Series are constructed using one-piece aluminum main tubes that are nitrogen-purged. The 2.5-10X 44 mm features a 30 mm tube that allows for 80 minutes of elevation and windage adjustment. Kaspas are marketed as being waterproof and fogproof, claims that we positively confirmed using hot-water-submersion and freezing tests.



One of the unique aspects of this particular Kaspa optic is the illuminated mil-dot reticle in which 16 dots are imposed on thin crosshairs. The distance between the centers of each dot measure 1 mil or 3.438 minutes of angle. Mil-dot reticles are widely used in military and law enforcement circles to estimate range and provide accurate hold overs and reference points. Since the dots are of a known diameter and spaced at a consistent distance, they can be used as reference points to measure the distance to a target of a known size.



A mil subtends approximately one yard at 1,000 yards and one meter at 1,000 meters; a simple formula translates that into a practical yardstick. For example: a target that is 5 feet (1.67 yards) tall and covers 3 mils in the reticle is 556 yards from the shooter (1.67 yards/3 mils x 1000= 556). It is important to note that, since this is a second-focal-plane reticle that maintains a consistent size throughout the adjustment range, the reticle is only calibrated for mil-dot use at the highest magnification of 10X. Though this may seem complicated at first glance, shooters experienced with the system can estimate ranges incredibly fast, and numerous charts, phone Apps and online aids are available in addition to a helpful guide included with the scope. The illuminated reticle turns the entire center of the reticle from black to red and has 11 brightness settings for varying lighting conditions. Even at its brightest setting, the illumination is not visible in bright sunlight but it can be an effective aiming tool in diminished lighting conditions.



The Kaspa adjusts for both windage and elevation using target-style turrets. The turrets are adjusted by pulling the dials away from the scope body, which unlocks them. The adjustments are designated by numbered hash marks on the turret dial and by audible clicks-each representing 1/4 m.o.a. Pressing the dials back inward locks the adjustments in place, and the turrets can be reset at the “0” position using an included hex wrench. The clicks were audible as well as tactile, though they could be more positive as they were a bit “mushy” at times when making adjustments-this can be an issue when making adjustments while wearing hearing protection. We measured the precision of the adjustments by “shooting the box” at 100 yards. The “box” target was not perfect, but it was within the accuracy margin of the rifle/load we were using for the test. To test the adjustments under more practical conditions, we used the dials to adjust for elevation to engage a 10-inch steel target at a measured 400 yards using a chronographed load and a trusted iPhone ballistics app. The data called for 39 clicks of elevation to account for the range which we dialed-up from the established 100-yard zero. With no measurable wind, five shots were fired from a steady bench rest with zero hits. It was determined that the rounds were striking below the target and it took several more inches of adjustment to put the rounds on the steel plate.



Optically, the Kaspa’s image is clear and bright with no apparent distortion or dimming at the edges. The fully multicoated lenses and 44 mm objective transmit light well and the scope compares well at its price point when it comes to brightness and image quality. The side-focus knob adjusts parallax and allows the shooter to bring objects into focus at varying ranges-an option not usually found on scopes with less than 12X of magnification. The adjustment was easy to use, however, we did find that the yardage designations on the knob did not precisely match the real world focus distances. Using a collimator, we also tested the power adjustment to detect any drift during the range of magnification; we could determine no shift in the reticle whatsoever, which is critical.



The 2.5-10X 44 mm Kaspa Tactical is a versatile optic with good glass and some excellent features. An adjustable illuminated reticle, locking target-style turrets, and a side-focus parallax adjustment are three options not generally found on a scope that retails for around $300. All Weaver scopes include a limited lifetime warranty that protects the original owner from product defects.

      <![CDATA[It’s no secret that 3-gun has become one of the fastest growing shooting sports in decades. Like any sport, the nature of the competition has driven the development and specialization of equipment used by the participants. While handguns and, to an extent, rifles have already evolved as tools for the practical shooter, the shotgun had a long way to go before it was “race ready.” Now we are seeing purpose-built, practical, competition shotguns being developed by major manufacturers. The <a href="http://www.berettausa.com/" target="_blank">Beretta</a> 1301 Competition is the World’s oldest gunmaker’s foray into the emerging world of 3-Gun.



A scattergun designed for practical competition shooting must encompass several distinct qualities: It must be reliable, fast cycling, easy to load rapidly and quick handling, and it must minimize recoil to provide for rapid, accurate shots. Making a gas-operated, <a title="View more semi-auto shotguns. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/Shotguns-Semi-Auto" target="_blank">semi-automatic shotgun</a> reliable while limiting recoil is a more daunting task than most shooters realize. The challenge is to allow enough gas into the system to ensure positive cycling without dumping too much gas into the receiver, which would accentuate felt recoil. Striking this balance is made even more delicate by the sheer variety of shotgun loads that an end-user will feed interchangeably. Fortunately, in a competition gun you have a pretty good idea what kind of loads are going to be fired. Beretta starts with its gas-operated, semi-auto receiver and what it calls the “Blink” operating system, which boasts an increased cycling speed. In this gun, the system appears regulated specifically for 2 ¾-inch target loads so that they cycle as reliably as possible. I found the 1301 Comp to be 100 percent reliable throughout testing, being able to fire shot strings with times as low as 0.17 seconds, while maintaining a relationship with a downrange target. The 1301 system struck me as an excellent balance of reliability and recoil.



The biggest challenge that the shotgun presents to most 3-Gun competitors is not the speed at which they can empty it, but the speed in which they can reload it. The best of the best can load their shotguns with amazing speed and finesse born through endless hours of practice, but there are also some hardware shortcuts that help make this possible. Most shotguns designed for hunting were designed with relatively small loading ports, presumably to add strength to the receiver and to keep debris out of the internals. As the sport of 3-Gun took off, custom gunsmiths milled those loading ports open to allow for greater access to the magazine tube and provide room for fingers to manipulate rounds into the firearm. Beretta has eliminated the need for such customization by manufacturing the 1301 with a generous loading port and a bevel that runs the complete circumference of the opening. It is very easy to feed rounds into the magazine tube of this firearm and you can do so without being bitten by the loading gate-another common problem with factory shotguns.



Another modification that 3-gunners have always made to shotguns was to replace the controls with oversized units that are fast and easy to manipulate. Once again, Beretta makes these features standard on the 1301 Comp. An oversized charging handle, safety button and bolt release are designed for maximum speed of use, and were fast and simple to manipulate, with traditional and intuitive locations. Even under the adrenaline dump that can turn the body into a quivering mess when the competition timer goes off, these controls would be hard to miss.



The 1301 uses an injection-molded synthetic stock that is impregnated with very functional, checkered gripping surfaces. If checkering this aggressive were on metal, it would tear your skin apart but on plastic it’s just right to keep your hands where you want them while shooting, running, jumping and otherwise negotiating the often aggressive match stages. A short 13-inch length-of-pull (LOP) makes this gun easy to bring to the shoulder without snagging on clothing and puts the shooter in an aggressive forward-leaning position to manage recoil. Spacers can be used to extend this LOP if desired.



This model is available with either a 21- or 24-inch barrel, and both come standard with Beretta’s Optima Bore HP interchangeable choke system-an Improved Cylinder choke ships with the gun. The standard capacity is 5+1 but the test gun came equipped with a Nordic Components extension tube that brought the capacity up to a more match-ready 8+1. This tube extends forward nearly to the muzzle of the 24-inch barrel. With a little practice, the entire magazine can be fired in well under 3 seconds.



The rules of 3-Gun can vary from one match to another, but, in nearly all matches, optics are allowed in certain divisions. The 1301 receiver is drilled and tapped at the factory for the mounting of an optic, offering yet another gunsmithing step that isn’t necessary to get this setup ready for serious competition. A Picatinny rail is available as an accessory from Beretta and the screw spacing is compatible with other aftermarket designs on the market.



With a 24-inch barrel and the extension tube installed, the 1301 Competition weighs in at 7 pounds, 1.8 ounces. If it were much lighter, recoil would be less manageable and if it were too much heavier, you’d be sacrificing the quick-handling and pointing qualities. If you’ve ever tried to swing a heavy gun on a quail hunt or in a match, you know what I’m talking about. This gun handles and points like a competition gun should, yet it is very controllable during rapid strings of fire. You can’t cheat physics when it comes to weight and recoil, but this Beretta isn’t too far out on either end of the spectrum.



Shooting the 1301 Comp wasn’t necessarily remarkable; it’s a light gun, it handles fast and it shoots where you point it. From a range perspective, the most impressive feature of this 1301 is the speed at which it allows the shooter to transition between targets. The best way that I can describe this is by comparing making a sharp turn in a pickup truck to doing it in a Camaro. The gun’s stock dimensions are a bit more rifle-like than shotguns designed specifically for aerial shooting, which is appropriate for a gun designed for the type of shots usually encountered in a 3-Gun match. As mentioned earlier, this Beretta functioned without a hiccup.



My overall impression of this shotgun is that it’s a really nice turnkey setup for someone looking to break into 3-Gun or a serious competitor interested in upgrading equipment. It is by no means an inexpensive firearm, but when you factor-in the custom upgrades that are built into the design, you’re saving hundreds of dollars in gunsmithing. Beretta has stayed relevant by responding to the whims of the marketplace and the 1301 is a prime example of a quality product put forward to meet a specific consumer demand.

        <![CDATA[Bought one right after it was made available by Beretta.  Got mine online for a $1000.  

Beautiful shotgun, easy to handle, the loading port has no sharp edges.  I like the extra large bolt release and that charging handle is easy to grasp.

I have used it for trap where one round is loaded at a time.  I think the 24' barrel makes it a little harder to hit the birds, but I am a novice at that sport.  At the range, it is another story.  Load it with 5 shells and it delivers the shot to the target quickly.  In fact the target gets torn apart by the time you finish.

I would recommend this shotgun to anyone who like shotguns, especially Beretta.]]>

    <title>A New Cartridge? </title>

      <![CDATA[I have been advised that the brass manufacturer <a href="http://www.starlinebrass.com/" target="_blank">Star-Line</a> is making a new style of brass for <a href="http://bumpbuster.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Speedbump Stockworks</a>, which special ordered it after purchasing the rights to the proprietary case from Bruce Young. Intended for the Cowboy Action Game, the brass is a new rimmed .45 case, head-stamped “<a title="Visit and purchase this interesting brass. " href="http://cowboy45specialbrass.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Cowboy” and “.45 Special</a>.” It is best described as a .45 Colt, shortened to .45 ACP length. The necessity for such a thing seems kind of elusive until you look into the situation more deeply.



The .45 Colt cartridge has been with us since the 1870s, when it was introduced with the new Peacemaker Colt Army revolver. That was the heyday of blackpowder and the new round had room for plenty of it. As a modern round with modern powders, the .45 Colt’s case capacity is excessive. Cowboy Action Shooting demands low velocities and lead bullets, which is no challenge for a competent handloader. Still, it would be make for more efficient reloading if the case was shorter. Understand that the old Long Colt is probably the most popular round in the game, both in replica and Colt SAAs, as well as many lever guns. So what can you find for shorter brass?



The .45 Auto Rim might seem like a good idea. It is a short, rimmed cartridge designed for revolver cylinders chambered for the .45 ACP-like the 300,000 Colt and S&amp;W 1917s of World War I  On this one, the rim is extra-thick to equal the ACP rim thickness, plus the additional thickness of the moon clip for which the guns were designed. The Auto Rim works to perfection in DA/SA revolvers chambered for ACP, but won’t work in SAA revolvers chambered for either the ACP or Long Colt.



How about the short round with a .45 Colt rim? That’s the .45 S&amp;W, which is sometimes called the .45 Schofield or-infrequently-the .45 Short Colt. Built to equal the original performance of the .45 Colt in the shorter-cylindered Schofield revolvers, this cartridge was dormant for decades. The SASS people brought it back to life for their modern shooting sport. I would have bet that this would be the solution, but I was wrong. It turns out the .45 Schofield is a perfect fit in length for what we are seeking, but the rim is shaped to be incompatible with some of the guns guys are using in the Cowboy shoots.



For these reasons, we are about to get a .45 ACP-length, rimmed brass that will run through just about anything chambered for the .45 Colt. For shooters using S&amp;W revolvers chambered for the Colt, this round makes an efficient option for custom loading. It might also be a functional option for use in some of those troublesome .45 Colt lever guns. It’s going to be fun to see how it all shakes out.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[This new cartridge continues to intrigue me and raise questions.  In some sense the .45 Cowboy Special would be a 'sub-load' to the .45 Colt, as the .44 Special is to the .44 Magnum, and the .38 Special is to the .357 Magnum.  That brings to my thinking what Grant Cunningham calls 'The Bullet Jump Controversy,' which he addresses very thoroughly in a blog post dated 06 June 2012.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[DEM: The short answer is that the .45 Colt was designed back in the black powder days and has more case capacity than is needed for smokeless powder.  And, if you want to reduce its velocity for the Cowboy shooters, then you really have too much case capacity.  By making the case smaller you increase the 'efficiency' because you can use less powder to arrive at your desired velocity. Just like needing less powder in a 'small' .38 Special case than in a 'large' .357 Magnum case to get the same velocity. Is this new .45 Colt Special a good idea? You might save a penny on powder and increase the density of the loading but you increase the jump from the case to the rifling. If it proves to be an advantage for the Cowboy shooters it might survive. For shooters like you it is a non-event; a solution looking for a problem.  ]]></comment_content>

      <![CDATA[Bullpup rifles offer the advantage of shorter overall length, but are typically taller than their traditional counterparts. Elite Survival Systems now offers a high-quality discreet case that takes into account the bullpup’s unique dimensional aspect ratio and offers excellent protection.



The company’s U.S.-made Covert Operations Discreet Case for Bullpups is designed to fit the IWI Tavor, Steyr AUG/A3, FN FS2000 and similar guns and features 1000-denier-nylon construction with heavy-duty closed cell foam padding.



Hook-and-loop tie-down straps in the main compartment secure the gun-even with an attached optic, bipod, light and magazine-and a protective panel separates it from four built-in internal magazine pouches. Wraparound handles and a detachable shoulder strap ease transport of the 30x13x3½-inch case. Price: $120<strong>.</strong>

      <![CDATA[In response to strong customer demand, <a href="http://www.gator-skins.com" target="_blank">Gatorskins</a> has introduced a Zip Front shirt in men’s sizes.



Made entirely in the United States, the new addition retains all the features that have made Gatorskins so successful, namely, light weight (a men’s Large is only 10.5 ozs.), warmth, windproofness and water repellancy. Yet the garment still breathes well and wicks sweat.



Unique to the Zip Front are thumbhole sleeves, a front “hand warmer” pocket and zippered neck/collar. Originally designed for motorcycle riders, Gatorskins have found success with military and law enforcement personnel as well as athletes and outdoorsmen.



The Gatorskins Zip Front shirt will ship with an MSRP of $90.

      <![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.nssf.org/" target="_blank">National Shooting Sports Foundation</a> (NSSF) has announced that its membership roll now tops 10,000-an all-time high for the trade association of the firearms industry.



The milestone comes just a month in advance of the NSSF's annual Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade Show (better known to many as SHOT Show), where the association typically adds to its membership totals. Such members include manufacturers, distributors, federally licensed firearms retailers, shooting facilities, outdoor media publishers, industry associates and individuals.



Chris Dolnack, senior vice president and chief marketing officers of the NSSF, said the association's growth has helped its speak with a single, powerful voice on behalf of the industry.



"NSSF membership continues to climb because more industry-connected companies, organizations and individuals are aware of the many ways NSSF works to promote, protect and preserve hunting and the shooting sports," Dolnack said.

    <title>Weatherby SA-08 Deluxe 28 Gauge</title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=26887</link>

      <![CDATA[Some hunters have learned that the 28 gauge is a formidable game cartridge, and <a href="http://www.weatherby.com" target="_blank">Weatherby’s</a> new sleek and racy SA-08 Deluxe will find a warm place in the hearts of these true believers. Made in Turkey to Weatherby’s specifications, the SA-08 28 tips the scale at under 6 lbs. Weight is distributed similarly to other gas-operated semi-automatics that have a slightly barrel-heavy feel. That isn’t all bad, because the forward hand guides the shot, and a bit more weight there helps steady the gun and prevents slowing and/or stopping of the swing.



From the butt, the SA-08 carries a “sporter-style” soft rubber pad with a slick plastic insert at the heel for a snag-free mount. With the very mild recoil of the 28, a pad is more a luxury than a necessity. The buttstock and fore-end are of plain hand-checkered walnut. The Turkish shotgun industry still does some things the old-fashioned way. When it comes to checkering, for instance, it is hand-cut, unlike that in most of the industry, which is laser-cut. It appears to be about 22 lines to the inch, and while the diamonds are not needle-pointed, they afford a good firm grip, which is what it’s supposed to do. To Weatherby’s advantage is the inclusion of several shims to adjust the stock for drop and cast. While not a professionally fitted stock, the owner can adjust the stock to best fit himself with the shims, and that’s a real advantage for a field gun where shots are often quick, and a well-fitting gun is the difference between fried quail for breakfast and Cheerios.



The receiver is machined from a hard aluminum alloy. The Turks may hand checker, but the machining is done on state-of-the-art CNC centers that ensure tight tolerances. The fact is that all the forces and pressures of firing in most semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns are taken up by the breech bolt and its engagement with the barrel extension. Some guns employ rifle-style rotating locking lugs and others, such as the SA-08, use a rising block in the bolt that engages a matching cut at the rear of the barrel extension. It is a hardened, machined piece of steel threaded onto the breech end of the barrel. When the action cycles and a live round is picked up from the magazine and pushed into the chamber, the last bit of forward thrust pushes a projection on the bolt carrier under the rear of the locking block that in turn rises into the cutout on the barrel extension, locking everything tight for the shot. It’s a system employed by <a href="http://www.remington.com" target="_blank">Remington</a> since the 1940s with the only difference being the SA-08 bolt locks up at the rear, and the Remington in the front.



Disassembly for cleaning is easy. The magazine cap is unscrewed, freeing the fore-end to slide off, and allowing barrel removal. The action is then taken apart by removing the charging handle, which is a little tricky. Close examination of the space in the bolt in which the bolt handle rides will reveal a slight half-moon cut on the top a little more than an inch rearward from the bolt face. With the butt resting on a bench, grasp the sleeve that surrounds the magazine tube and slowly pull back, observing the bolt. When the half-moon reaches a point parallel with the charging handle it can then be pulled straight out. Once out, it can be examined and found to have a flat side and half-moon-shaped side, indicating reassembly, again lining up the cut with the bolt handle. The test gun’s bolt handle was very hard to remove and necessitated a rag-wrapped pliers to extract. Replacement was easier.



Further disassembly required only pulling forward and withdrawing the magazine sleeve, action bars and bolt. The trigger assembly drops out after removing the single pin that holds it in place. Be sure to apply the safety when removing the trigger group, to avoid releasing the hammer. It’s not damaging, just annoying. Normal cleaning rules should be followed, including very light lubrication since lube attracts dirt, and semi-automatics don’t work well when dirty.



The barrel is chrome-lined and carries the gas cylinder and piston slung beneath it. Of note is that the SA-08 comes with two gas pistons, one labeled “LIGHT LOADS” and the other “HEAVY LOADS.” Because there are only two loads for the 28-ga., 3/4- and 1-oz., it seems a bit strange when compared with the 12 and its wide variety of loads. Still, changing the piston is about a two-minute job, and the presumption is that heavy loads are those carrying 1 oz. of shot. The difference between the light- and heavy-load pistons are slight with the light-load having a 1/16th circumferential spring in the same place as a solid, machined band on the heavy-load piston. Presumably, the spring contracts, easing the friction against the gas cylinder; and the solid area on the heavy-load’s piston provides more friction, slowing it and thus impacting the action with the same velocity.



The barrel’s bore measured 0.548", and the three choke tubes, improved cylinder, modified and full, offered additional constriction of 0.005", 0.012", 0.021", respectively.



Overall the gun is nicely finished with a deep black-anodized and highly polished receiver. The barrel is also a deep black that matches the receiver. In fact the only parts not polished black are the trigger, bolt and bolt release and the carrier.



Shooting any 28 gauge is a pleasure, and the SA-08 is no exception. The gun’s minimal recoil, light weight, and svelte shape, combined with the 28 gauge’s excellent ballistics, make this a great choice for grouse, bobwhites, game farm pheasants and surely a youngster’s first gun.

      <![CDATA[In order to meet the demands of the growing 3-Gun market, <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester</a> has developed custom loads, with a dual emphasis on speed and accuracy.



Winchester’s Win3Gun is competition-grade ammunition, available in the calibers used in 3-Gun competition-9 mm, .40 S&amp;W, .45 ACP, 5.56 mm and 12 gauge.



All pistol cartridges (9 mm, 40 S&amp;W and 45 ACP) in the Win3Gun line use lead-free primers and heel-encapsulated bullets. This makes the pistol offerings incredibly clean firing, which in turn keeps the compensator ports of popular competition pistols clean and free of vaporized lead.



The Win3Gun line also includes a center-fire rifle round in 5.56 mm with a 55-grain bullet and two 12-gauge shotgun loads with 7½ shot and 00 buckshot.



“3-Gun competition presents a very unique set of challenges and our engineers have stepped up to give competitors a new brand of Winchester ammunition on which they can stake their reputations,” said Brett Flaugher, vice president of sales, marketing and strategy for Winchester Ammunition. “Win3Gun meets the power factor requirements of most competitive shooting leagues and is designed for great functionality, speed, cleanliness and winning.”]]>

      <![CDATA[Joseph Eisel, 51, was asleep with his wife around 3 a.m. when he woke to a 27-year-old man he did not know standing over his bed. Startled and fearful for his life, Eisel reached for the 9 mm pistol he keeps bedside. The intruder fled the room and entered the Eisels’ garage. Eisel followed him into the garage where the intruder fell to the floor. Eisel ordered the intruder to stay on the floor while his wife dialed 911. Eisel held the intruder at gunpoint until police arrived a short time later. The intruder allegedly entered the home through a broken basement window. Reportedly no one was hurt during the home invasion. “Everybody complains about guns,” Eisel said of the incident, “but I’m glad I have one.” (<a href="http://www.butlereagle.com/" target="_blank"><em>Butler Eagle</em></a>, Cranberry Township, PA, 10/1/13)



After an argument occurred at a house party, one man was asked to leave. The 27-year-old man returned a short time later with a rifle and began firing shots outside the home. According to witnesses, the man then pointed the rifle at several people attending the party. A 39-year-old partygoer took action to stop what could have resulted in tragedy; he pulled out his own firearm and shot the man brandishing the rifle. The assailant was taken to a local hospital with life-threatening injuries. No other injuries were reported. (<a href="http://www.kpho.com/" target="_blank">KPHO.com</a>, Glendale, AZ, 10/20/13)



<em><strong>From The Armed Citizen Archives</strong></em>

<em>August 1984:</em> Phillip Borelli, co-owner of a Hempstead, N.Y., auto dealership, noticed two men asking his brother Anthony, the other proprietor, about the price of a truck. Suddenly, one pulled an unidentified weapon and struck Anthony on the head, knocking him to the ground. Phillip pulled his licensed revolver and fired, sending the two attackers fleeing. (<em>The Newsday</em>, Long Island, N.Y.)]]>

    <title>Benelli Introduces the Ethos</title>

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/keefe_africa_ethos.jpg"><img class="alignright" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="keefe_africa_ethos" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/keefe_africa_ethos-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198" /></a>Bird hunters and target shooters alike will have the opportunity to get their hands on the next generation of <a href="http://www.benelliusa.com/" target="_blank">Benelli</a> shotguns in 2014, thanks to the impending introduction and release of the company's new Ethos model.



The Ethos is comprised of some of Benelli's most successful innovations, both old and new. Naturally, the shotgun is centered around the company's famous Inertia Driven operating system. The carrier has been redesigned, making shells easier to load, and an enlarged bolt release makes for simpler and faster operation. The cartridge drop lever has been likewise changed, making the shotgun easier to handle and operate-even for a shooter in gloves. A newly patented Easy Locking System in the bolt body is designed to ensure that the rotating bold head locks up, and the Ethos' system is designed to cycle even the lightest of shotgun loads-right on down to 7/8 ozs. And all that's just scratching the surface of this potential game-changer.



The name, meanwhile, is representative of the craftsmanship that Benelli puts into its firearms. Ethos means "character," and has long been used to describe the guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize a community, nation or ideology. The Benelli brand has long prided itself on credibility, respect, integrity and merit-and the company views its new shotgun as the culmination of its own guiding ethos.<em></em>



More coverage of the shotgun is on the way, and you won't have to wait long. We can tell you that<em> American Rifleman</em> Editor-in-Chief Mark Keefe had the opportunity to put the Ethos to the test last May on a trip to Africa. All told, the group of invited gun writers fired more than 15,000 rounds during their stay-and experienced no  malfunctions.



<strong>Ethos Features Include:</strong>



• Easy loading

• Larger bolt release

• Easy access cartridge drop lever

• Newly patented easy locking system

• Patented anti-seize magazine cap

• Wider range of LOP adjustment

• Interchangeable carbon fiber rib

• Interchangeable fiber optic sights

• Combines form and function for improved ergonomics

• Ability to cycle the lightest loads

• Patented recoil system provides greater recoil reduction



Benelli will officially launch the Ethos in Las Vegas, Nev., at SHOT Show 2014.



For more information, stay tuned to <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org" target="_blank">AmericanRifleman.org</a>. Video coverage and a complete review of the Ethos will be published soon.

      <![CDATA[When a <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/12/10/missing-nevada-family-found-safe/?intcmp=latestnews" target="_blank">Nevada man went missing</a> in the Seven Troughs mountain range with his girlfriend and two children an all-scale search was conducted. They were discovered after surviving two days in below freezing temperatures because James Glanton stayed calm, kept his group together and knew a little bit about survival. Glanton was able to start a fire, and eventually used the spare tire as fuel to keep the family from freezing. While I don’t want to take anything away from this very capable man, I can’t believe that he went into a wilderness area in winter without some sort of survival pack.



Both of my vehicles are loaded with food, matches, lighters, tinder, road flares, a first-aid kit, water, blankets and medications. While the main kits are carried year round, I customize certain items depending on the time of year, i.e. don’t need blankets in July. I mostly created my own, but there are pre-made kits available from companies like <a href="http://www.asapsurvival.com/" target="_blank">ASAP Survival</a>.



Food items, which are replaced periodically, include Snickers, M&amp;Ms, crackers and peanut butter. I also like to include dehydrated meals and MREs. If the family and I are traveling or heading into the hills on a daytrip, I always stash my MSR WhisperLite International stove and a canister of fuel. I’ve even been meaning to throw in some instant coco and coffee, along with some instant soup mixes.



Other items that I like to carry are a folding shovel, ratchet straps, bungee cords, multiple knives and a couple of extra coats, but some people say I take being prepared a little bit overboard. These same people say I'm paranoid, but voices say they're wrong.



You can store gear in a backpack, which allows easy transport if needed, and many vehicles, especially SUVs, have neat little hidden areas that can be used to keep items out of eyesight. Also, spare tire wells are usually oversized, providing room for long-term items.



Problems can occur at any time, and the best way to survive and prevail is to be prepared. The Glanton family survived, but almost every year, there is at least one story about someone becoming stranded and dying in Old Man Winter’s fury.]]>

    <title>Industry Generosity</title>

      <![CDATA[It’s the holiday season, that time of year when the odds greatly increase that an anti-gun party crasher using a drink in each hand for balance will stagger you into a corner for a debate. I don’t know about you, but I’m tired of being polite. This year I’m firing back, with some solid information on the charitable work done by the shooting industry during 2013.



<a href="http://www.hornady.com/">Hornady</a> just made a donation in excess of $38,000 to the <a href="http://www.gracefoundationgi.org/">GRACE Foundation</a>, which is dedicated to helping cancer patients, their families and the survivors. If the drunk doesn’t care about health care, bring up public safety-including theirs. <a href="http://www.lewismachine.net/">Lewis Machine &amp; Tool Company</a> donated $5,350 to the <a href="http://ntoa.org/site/">National Tactical Officers Association</a>.



Then, of course, the industry always takes care of those in uniform. Earlier this year <a href="http://www.glock.com/GlockLanding/index.html">Glock</a> gave $100,000 to the <a href="http://www.specialops.org/">Special Operations Warrior Foundation</a>. <a href="http://www.peasegreeters.org/">Pease Greeters</a>, an organization that welcomes servicemen and women passing through Pease International Airport, received $25,000 from <a href="http://www.sigsauer.com/">SIG Sauer</a>. <a href="http://www.honoredveterans.org/">Honored American Veterans Afield</a> (HAVA) received $50,000 from <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CustomContentDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=750001&amp;catalogId=750051&amp;content=11001">Smith &amp; Wesson</a>.



<a href="https://www.yamahamotorsports.com/outdoor/products/lifestylehome/home.aspx">Yamaha Outdoors</a> donated a fully rigged Rhino as a grand prize in a drawing that raised money for HAVA and Feed the Children. <a href="http://www.rockyboots.com/">Rocky Brands</a> donated more than $100,000 to Give Breast Cancer the Boot.



That’s a short list, one even dead voters in Chicago can appreciate. I deliberately left out all the firearm-related donations.



Then there are those small things that go on all the time, with little or absolutely no fanfare. It’s just the right thing to do.



I was contacted by someone in the Army (name withheld) to ascertain if I knew anyone in the industry who would donate hats and ammo to a special hunt for wounded SOCOM soldiers. No photos, no interviews and, as you may have noticed, no details could be released. I’m not releasing anything (because these guys could hunt me down and hurt me), except for the fact <a href="http://www.federalpremium.com/">Federal Premium</a> stepped up to the plate with the requested gear. That’s about all the publicity the company can expect, and it knew so before sending the gear. How awesome is that?



And, in the 10 years I worked at <a href="http://www.nrahq.org">NRA</a> headquarters there was always a <a href="http://www.toysfortots.org/">Toys for Tots</a> donation box in the lobby in December. I’m not at my desk this year, but the box was-as I’m certain similar, small and from-the-heart programs are in every single firearms-related company in the nation.]]>

      <![CDATA[The latest issue of <em>American Hunter </em>magazine hit my desk last week and the first thing I did, as many of you do, was start at the back and thumb through the pictures before reading the Table of Contents. Maybe it’s my short attention span or the mere excitement of wanting to dive into a coyote hunting article and live vicariously through the writer's hands-all because a simple picture grabbed my kitten-minded curiosity. Photography is quintessential to what we do at NRA Publications; without great photographers and designers we could not give you the quality of magazines that we produce.



My job plays a major role in the stages of photography, mainly because I have the goods in my inventory. Unfortunately, it’s not as simple as just handing the photographers their subjects. Sometimes I may need to outfit a specific firearm with a specialized optic, laser, grip, sights, etc. Once I evaluate the necessary gear, I break everything down to clean and degrease (shhh.... outdoor writers aren’t the best at cleaning their guns). Next, I sign the gear over to our photo studio and then the magic begins.



Between producing art for five magazines, blogs and other departmental projects, our photo department is grinding its wheels 24/7, and part of my job is to assist in production.



I am often asked to help out with special projects. For instance, this past weekend I was asked to take pictures and video of whitetail deer. Since I am an avid hunter and planned on spending my weekend afield anyway, I agreed to take one for the team. Now, by taking one for the team, I mean taking an <a href="http://www.flir.com/uploadedFiles/CVS_Americas/Personal_Vision/Products/Scout_TS-Series/Scout-TS-Series-Datasheet.pdf" target="_blank">FLIR Scout TS32r Pro Handheld Thermal Night Vision Camera</a> and putting it to use.



“Dangit, now I have to work this weekend!” Wait a minute, who am I kidding?



In my job, a wide variety of equipment passes through my office. Often I am <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Flir-Image-for-No.2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-26970" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="Flir Image for No.2" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Flir-Image-for-No.2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>complacent with the products, but this one in particular grabbed my attention, not because of its “cool” factor but merely because I am a colorblind hunter. My disability has forced me to become a better shooter and ultimately a more ethical hunter. The big one that got away? Neither you or I will have to tell that tale anymore, as long as the FLIR is by our side. After seeing the capability and possibilities, I will make it a 2014 goal to budget for an <a href="http://www.flir.com/uploadedFiles/CVS_Americas/Personal_Vision/Products/Scout_TS-Series/Scout-TS-Series-Datasheet.pdf" target="_blank">FLIR camera</a>.



If you want to know why I am willing to shell out a little more than I normally would for an optic, check out a full review of the <a href="http://www.flir.com/uploadedFiles/CVS_Americas/Personal_Vision/Products/Scout_TS-Series/Scout-TS-Series-Datasheet.pdf" target="_blank">FLIR Scout TS32r Pro</a> in February’s issue of <em>American Hunter, </em>and bonus material via the iPad digital edition. Until next time, I hope everyone has a safe and happy holiday season!]]>

        <![CDATA[Joseph--I would say yes and no, all depending on the colors involved and the circumstances of lighting, backdrop, and foreground. There are times when I have an advantage but the major disadvantage is blood-trailing. When I hunt alone and especially bow hunting, I do not leave anything up for chance; quartering shot, distance, tight brush, etc. 

I am fortunate to at least see some colors. This has been an obstacle on more than one level for me not only for spotting and trailing game animals but simple tasks like picking out a tie everyday for work.

I will say game recovery could not be any easier with the FLIR. Scouting with FLIR is another bonus and makes for a less intrusive approach. ]]>

    <title>Farewell to Mikhail Kalashnikov</title>

      <![CDATA[It was regret that I opened an email today announcing the death of Mikhail Timonfeyevich Kalashnikov on Monday, Dec. 23, 2013, in Izhevsk, Russia. He was 94. At one time, a wounded Russian tank sergeant sketching ideas out while recovering from wounds received during “The Great Patriotic War,” he rose to become the designer of the world’s most produced firearm design-the Avtomat Kalashnikova. Developed to defend his “Mother Russia,” it became the Soviet Union’s most lasting export. Estimates vary, but it is thought that more than 100 million guns based on Kalashnikov’s design have been produced worldwide. I met and shook hands with Kalashnikov at trade show years ago, and through an interpreter found him to be gregarious and engaging. The regime for which he designed the gun was indeed, in President Ronald Reagan’s words, an “Evil Empire,” but the world’s alignment changed greatly during Mikhail Kalashnikov’s long life. There is no doubt that the peasant boy that rose to be a lieutenant general was one of the greatest arms designers of the 20th century.



The gun designed by Kalashnikov (and those in the design bureau working with him) emerged onto the world stage in 1956 during the Hungarian Uprising, as Soviet troops crushed the rebellion there. The gun went on to become a symbol of Soviet power and communist ideology, a rugged, reliable design that was well suited to its intended role as an infantry arm in the hands of peasant conscripts. It was selective fire, chambered for the intermediate 7.62x39 mm cartridge, and easy to understand and operate. How revolutionary was it? You can find it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Mozambique">Mozambique’s flag</a>.



The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union left Kalashnikov as likely one of the most well-known brands to come out of Russia in the last 60 years, but it had limited commercial success. There was a magazine called <em>Kalashnikov</em>, and there have been knives, vodka and other non-gun products. My friend and former <em>American Rifleman</em> Technical Editor Mike Bussard brought me a bottle of the first Kalashnikov vodka, which he claimed fit in a Russian army canteen cover. Sure enough when I brought it home, I tried it in a World War II Soviet canteen cover, and it fit just as advertised. I even picked up an air soft “KALSHNIKOV” made in China and rendered in brittle plastic for a birthday present a few years back. And of course, many semi-automatic-only versions of the AK have been offered by various importers. Oddly enough, there are at least two firms producing semi-automatic versions of the AK here in the United States today.



And he was an NRA Life member who, in a 1999 speech on his 80th birthday, forcefully reiterated his firm support for the right to keep and bear arms by private citizens all over the world.



If you want to have a look at both the social and historical implications of Kalashnikov and his rifle, I highly recommend <a href="http://cjchivers.com/aboutthegun"><em>The Gun</em> </a>by C.J. Chivers, who is a Pulitzer prize winner. It is a well-researched and brilliantly written book.]]>

      <![CDATA[This year, to put it politely, has been sporty. Loss of loved ones, leaving the friends who had become family at NRA headquarters for a job that didn’t work out, attempted break-in, no movement whatsoever in the court system, deployed family members and even the sale of a house at the wrong time have made 2013 interesting.



I’m still one of the luckiest people on the planet, and this time of year reaffirms my belief. You are, too. Find the time between all the festivities to inventory the unwrapped gifts you received in the past 364 days, and you’ll agree.



I never expected my list to include multiple deliveries at about 1 a.m. when I was holding my <a href="http://http://wilsoncombat.com/new/handgun-cqb-elite.asp">Wilson Combat CQB Elite</a>. Of course, nobody ever schedules a break-in.



Special thanks go out to every single instructor who droned into my brain precisely how to conduct myself and safely surrender my firearm once law enforcement arrives. I’m not an operator, don’t pretend to be, and 100 percent of my actions as the first deputy arrived were muscle memory-multiple repetitions of the routine, over and over and over again, until I was about bored out of my skull during training sessions. It kicked in that morning, but part of the thanks also has to go out to the first deputy who arrived. I wouldn’t want to be in his situation.



The detective assigned to the case was wonderful and both responding deputies were courteous and professional. The staff at the Sheriff’s office connected me with the overworked district attorney’s office to help offset my concerns after the perp’s release.



There are a lot more who deserve thanks. I hope they’ll read this blog and understand what a great gift they provided, probably without ever knowing I’d put it to use.



In the meantime, my youngest grandson and I made a meager delivery to the Hoke County Sheriff’s office. It’s not much, just some cheese, crackers, cookies and, yes, donuts with sprinkles (no holiday squad room is complete without them).



Those who protect and serve respond to some tough situations. When they do so with a grace and style that honors those of us who have decided to take charge of our own safety and that of our family by carrying a firearm-and getting a solid education in its lawful use-it’s the least we can do this time of year.



Merry Christmas.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Back when I was working in court I used to tell people if they apprehended Billy Burglar in their living room with the family electronics in a pillow case it would be 120 days before Billy would be sentenced IF the case moved along with blinding speed without a single continuance. That's such a rare occurrence you can expect to get struck by lightening two times before such a thing would happen. If Billy is out on OR or bail, he will have committed at least several other burglaries in the interim and may not even remember the particular burglary he is being sentenced for. It's hard to remember exactly where you were and what you did when you are high on drugs or alcohol or both. You are lucky the incident turned out w/o any shooting on either side. Make sure you are notified of all court appearances and especially make sure you are at the sentencing hearing which will probably be continued several times. Be prepared to be shocked at how minimal the sentence will be even though residential burglary during night time hours is a class I felony in most jurisdictions I know about. Be prepared for the DA to take a plea to criminal trespass or some similar misdemeanor and the subsequent much more minimal sentence. Billy may even be released the day of his sentencing with credit for time served.  ]]></comment_content>

    <title>I Have This Old Gun: U.S. Model 1841 “Mississippi” Rifle</title>

      <![CDATA[<strong>Gun:</strong> U.S. Model 1841 "Mississippi" Rifle

<strong>Manufacturer:</strong> E. Remington, Herkimer, N.Y.

<strong>Serial Number:</strong> None

<strong>Condition:</strong> NRA Antique Good

<strong>Caliber:</strong> .54

<strong>Manufactured:</strong> 1853

<strong>Value:</strong> $3,400



America’s soldiers are fond of giving their favorite firearms nicknames-“Kentucky,” “Ol’ Slabsides,” “Horizontal Shot Tower”-but few are as evocative as the U.S. Model 1841 “Mississippi” rifle. Considered one of the most beautiful military longarms of the 19th century, the Model 1841 garnered its honors in a hard-fought engagement at the Battle of Buena Vista during the Mexican-American War in the hands of the 1st Mississippi Rifles, commanded by West Point graduate (and future Secretary of War and President of the Confederate States of America) Jefferson Davis.



The U.S. Percussion Rifle, Model 1841, as it was officially titled, was also known as “Windsor,” after two of its contractors and the “Jager,” (also “Yager” and “Yaeger”) because of its perceived German styling.



Initially manufactured at the federal Harpers Ferry Armory beginning in 1846 and (possibly) Springfield Armory in 1849, contracts were also given to civilian gun companies including Eliphalet Remington of Herkimer, N.Y.; Robbins, Kendall &amp; Lawrence of Windsor, Vt.; Robbins &amp; Lawrence of Windsor, Vt.; George W. Tryon of Philadelphia, Pa. (who also ostensibly made some 1841s for the Republic of Texas); and Eli Whitney of New Haven, Conn. The State of South Carolina contracted with Boatwright &amp; Glaze of the Palmetto Armory in Columbia, S.C., to build 11,000 Model 1841s for state troops, though only about 1,000 were actually produced, 500 of which were incinerated when the Citadel in Columbia was razed by Union troops during the Civil War. Fakes of Palmetto ’41s are known, so potential buyers should be wary. Spurious Texas-marked Tryon guns have also been observed, as well, but as there is some speculation that none were really ever manufactured in the first place, it may be rather hard to counterfeit something that never existed.



The Model 1841 measured 48½" overall, weighed 9 pounds, 12 ounces, and had a 33-inch round barrel, which was lacquer-painted brown. The lock was case-hardened and bore an American eagle with the date of manufacture on Harpers Ferry rifles, or the name of the maker and date on contract guns (excepting Palmettos). Rifling was seven grooves, and the rear sight a non-adjustable notch. All furniture was of brass, as was the front sight and head of the trumpet-shaped ramrod. The elongated butt box lid was hinged and concealed a compartment for bullet patches, nipple wrench/screwdriver tool, worm and spare nipple. The rifle had no provision for a bayonet, an omission that was criticized by many troops-the 1st Mississippi Rifles, for example, carried Bowie knives to compensate. Eventually several methods for attaching a bayonet to the Mississippi were developed.



As well as on the Frontier, Mississippis saw considerable use by both Yanks and Rebs in the early part of the Civil War-usually by state units-but their popularity waned as more Model 1861 Rifle-Muskets and Pattern 1853 Enfields became available. To accommodate newer technologies, some ’41s had their barrels re-bored to .58 caliber, and the simple notch rear sights replaced with more sophisticated adjustable long-range models.



The Model 1841 shown here was manufactured by Remington in 1853; and although no original finish remains, metal parts are sharp and exhibit a nice, even overall gray patina. Bore is fine, mechanicals tight, and the stock is excellent, still retaining its inspector’s cartouche. It is affected only by the period initials “A.J.T.” neatly incised into the butt. The butt box contains all original accessories. As such it’s worth $3,400. Generally speaking, guns with Mexican War dates will bring a premium.

        <![CDATA[Duane, the article states that the model 1841 '...was initially manufactured at the federal Harpers Ferry Armory beginning in 1846'. The Mexican war lasted from 1846 to1848. The Remington pictured above, which was manufactured in 1853, obviously didn't exist at the time of the Mexican war.

      <![CDATA[Owners of <a href="http://ruger.com/index.html" target="_blank">Ruger’s</a> popular Mini-14 series of rifles will be pleased to know that it is possible to upgrade the guns’ rear aperture sight assemblies. Tech-SIGHTS’s RR200 unit, which features a knurled, finger-adjustable windage knob and an adjustable elevation knob with a finer aperture than is used on the factory unit, is designed to fit pre-2005 Mini-14 and Mini-30 rifles.



The sight assembly’s parts are spring-loaded to eliminate slop, and they fit into the factory pocket machined into the receiver, meaning no gunsmithing is required. Similar models are available to fit other Mini-14s and a variety of other firearms including the Ruger 10/22, Marlin 60, AK-47 and SKS. Price: $65.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[A question actually; I've been looking for optional sights for the Mini-14 for some time. It'd be helpful if the aprture sizes had been specified. Can you help ? Also, wondering if there's a HK type turret sight available that would fit in the same manner. I like these as a couple more apertures are readily available.

      <![CDATA[Claimed to equal or exceed the flash suppression effectiveness of the best single-function flash suppressors, the White Sound Defense FOSSA-556 also vents gasses away from the ground to limit dust disturbance and minimize muzzle rise, allowing faster shot-to-shot recovery.



Results are achieved by redirecting propellant gasses between the specially designed prongs and tapered vents. In addition, the FOSSA-556 is also designed to eliminate the ringing sound associated with some open-prong devices.



The FOSSA-556 is machined from 17-4PH stainless steel and is available with either titanium aluminum nitride or black oxide surface coating. Threading is standard ½-inch x28 t.p.i. to fit most ARs and many other .223 Rem/5.56x45 mm NATO rifles. Price: $99-$109.

    <title>Weatherby Vanguard Series 2 TRR RC</title>

      <![CDATA[Four days prone behind a rifle on <a href="http://www.gunsite.com/" target="_blank">Gunsite’s</a> Sniper Ridge is a real education. The painful reality that long-range precision is a perishable skill quickly becomes obvious, as well as the fact that some rifles need lengthy range sessions and dusty conditions for their virtues to shine. Such was the case with the <a href="http://www.weatherby.com/" target="_blank">Weatherby</a> Vanguard Series 2 TRR RC. It thrived in the high desert’s dirt, grime and general abuse, so much so that the only thing seen choking on the firing line were my journeyman marksmanship skills.



Weatherby’s reputation is legend in the hunting community, but the tactical world was uncharted territory for the company when it introduced the Threat Response line several years ago. Flat-shooting cartridges and accurate rifles are nothing new to the firm, though, so it harnessed many of the thoroughbred features found on the famed Mark V action, including a one-piece, fully machined receiver. After all, you need a sturdy foundation to regularly connect at 600 yards.



No stoppages, failures to feed or any problems with a dozen identical rifles running in the sandy environment of Arizona is a testament to the one-piece, fluted bolt on the Vanguard Series 2 TRR (Threat Response Rifle) RC (Range Certified). The design is Mauser-style, with dual opposed-lugs. A three-position safety mounted on the bolt allows removal of a cartridge with the safety engaged. The bolt handle isn’t oversized like most precision rifles with this mission, but there is an indicator on the back of the bolt that signals if it’s cocked.



If there’s one complaint I have about the rifle, it’s the lack of a detachable box magazine. Pulling back on a lever in front of the trigger guard releases the hinged floorplate. The rifle has a 5+1 capacity in both available chamberings and the only thing embellished on the rifle is a Range Certified logo engraved on the bottom metal.



The free-floated, 22-inch barrel has a No. 3 contour with a .740-inch diameter at the muzzle end. A recessed target crown protects the rifling and an aluminum bedding plate is integral with the stock. This isn’t your traditional, slicked up, beauty-pageant-winning Weatherby, either. It’s built for business, and the aramid/fiberglass composite stock reflects that mission. Actually, it really doesn’t reflect much because it’s black, flat black. Even the metal is matte black, almost darker than the stock thanks to bead-blasting.



The fore-end has dual swivel studs that allow the use of a sling and a bipod without adding adapters of any sort, and its flat shape makes it ideal for a rest on sandbags or level surfaces.  There’s not much recoil in .308 Win., especially in a rifle that weighs nearly nine pounds before a scope is mounted. But after four days behind the trigger-from the prone position-it can add up. Thankfully the <a href="http://www.pachmayr.com/home/" target="_blank">Pachmayr</a> Decelerator recoil pad proved effective enough that I didn’t hear a single complaint, even as we churned through case after case of <a href="http://www.black-hills.com/" target="_blank">Black Hills</a> ammo.



Weatherby’s adjustable, two-stage trigger is a thing of beauty. Even when taking let-off weight measurements later it still seemed fresh to the touch and crisp, rather than creepy. Triggers leave the factory set at between 2.5 and 3.8 pounds, and the test rifle came in at an extremely consistent 2.5 pounds. The trigger guard is generous enough to ease gloved operation.



The Range Certified label means the rifle has passed a series of tests at the company’s indoor range. It’s part of the company’s sub-MOA guarantee and indicates a three-shot group was delivered during the testing that measured .99 inches or less at 100 yards. Each certified rifle is shipped with one of the groups it printed, and that target is signed by company President Ed Weatherby.



But the seminar at Gunsite was not taking place indoors. Shooters would be using <a href="http://www.harrisbipods.com/" target="_blank">Harris</a> bipods, not benches, dust would be a factor, along with wind, mirage and dirty guns. Connecting on steel out at 500 yards in less than ideal conditions may be challenging, but it’s a great test of a rifle’s practical potential.



The optics used in Arizona were <a href="http://www.leupold.com/" target="_blank">Leupold</a> 4.5-14x50 mm riflescopes. We mounted our own scopes, which leads me to my last complaint. It’s tapped for Weatherby mounts, which by no means is it a deal-breaker, but it’s certainly worth mentioning.



Once sighting in was done, distances were stretched on Sniper Ridge. The Weatherby didn’t showcase its full potential in my hands, but what I was witnessing nearby was nothing short of amazing. I had trouble picking up the steel targets at 800 yards, in the shade with a dark background, thanks to devilish instructors who take great pride in pushing every shooter’s limits (I’m pretty sure they arranged for the scorpion infatuated with my bipod, too). Others could pick them out fast, though, connecting and sending that familiar “ding” sound back to the ridge long after the rifle’s report had faded into the distance. More than 700 was doable, regularly, even with my unpolished technique.



Yes, there were plenty of missed first and second shots at that distance. A 5 mile per hour, full-value breeze drifted things a little and when the wind gods doubled that figure it got even more challenging. The targets weren’t 5 feet across, either. In fact, most were standard steel silhouettes. We dialed for elevation and held for windage-a technique that was fast and effective in the changing conditions thanks to spotters and the mil-based reticle.



The rifles ran flawlessly, even though cleaning consisted of only a few patches run through the bores after lunch and dinner. There was no other maintenance performed, yet the Weatherby/Leupold combination remained deadly accurate in the dust, dirt, grime and poisonous insects.



Gunsite’s testing proved the Weatherby Vanguard Series 2 TRR RC can survive, and even thrive in the abuse delivered to most patrol-style rifles. But how well does it actually print on paper with five-shot groups instead of three, and multiple groups delivered in rapid succession?



The rifle returned for more testing and was topped with a <a href="http://www.redfield.com" target="_blank">Redfield</a> 2-7x34 mm scope. At 100 yards on a dead-calm day, the performance remained amazing. Numbers don’t tell the whole story, though. The <a href="http://www.federalpremium.com/" target="_blank">Federal</a> load with <a href="http://www.sierrabullets.com/" target="_blank">Sierra</a> MatchKings, for example, averaged just below MOA, but the groups indicate that figure could have been much better. Four of the five shots chronically punched a single ragged hole, with one random shot wandering out. That’s not uncommon, but the tightness of the other four bullet holes was surprising to say the least. I’d chalk that up to operator error, not barrel heating as some might suggest.



The barrel did get hot, but the <a href="http://www.remington.com" target="_blank">Remington</a> load (the last one tested) pretty much dismissed any heating concerns. Few of the holes touched and groups were consistent, with no stringing at all. Yes, a cool-off period was granted between each group, but coming in with an average of 1.17 inches, with a relatively hot barrel using production hunting loads is the kind of reliable performance I witnessed in Arizona.



If you’re in the market for a patrol-style rifle that can take a beating, and consistently connect at distance, the Weatherby Vanguard Series 2 TRR RC is worth a close look. It may not have a box magazine for fast reloads, but with accuracy like this how many shots do you really need<strong>?</strong>

        <![CDATA[Here's how I did it. I bought a Weatherby Vanguard Varmint 20' for less than $600. Hogue pillar bedded stock $100.  Timney Trigger $140. Tubbs Bore Polish system under $100.00.  So you can do the same thing yourself for under $1000.  Mine shoots 10 shot MOA groups if I do my part.  The $200 dollars savings helped offset the cost of a Nightforce. By the way, you can easily put a Picatinney rail on a Weatherby or use Talley mounts and bases.

    <title>Winchester Announces W Train &amp; Defend Brand</title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=27052</link>

      <![CDATA[The firearms industry is dealing with more first-time gun owners than ever before, and those new consumers have found themselves confronted with a seemingly endless array of ammunition options. <a href="http://www.winchester.com" target="_blank">Winchester Ammunition</a> has decided to make things a little easier on new shooters, with the introduction of its new W Train &amp; Defend brand-which is designed to create a very straightforward process when choosing training and personal defense rounds.



The W Train &amp; Defend ammunition system is designed to provide threat stopping power with less recoil to the shooter.  The system pairs its range-ready Train rounds with technology-driven Defend rounds, both designed to limit the recoil felt by the shooter. The new system provides an ideal solution for new shooters, as it helps train an operator to become proficient with their personal defense ammunition.



“The influx of new female shooters to the outdoor/shooting sports category is significant and we are committed to making their experiences positive when it comes to selecting the appropriate gear, which includes ammunition,” said Brett Flaugher, vice president of sales, marketing and strategy. “After an extensive amount of research, we believe this line of quality products will serve a community of new shooters and others who are excited to learn more about target shooting and personal defense, as well as responsible gun ownership.”



Winchester developed the Train rounds of the W Train &amp; Defend system with reduced recoil characteristics and lead-free primers, for improved indoor range acceptance. They will be packed in 50-count boxes, and are identified with a prominent "T" on the packaging.



The Defend rounds, naturally, are adorned with a very visible "D." The high performance rounds were developed for threat stopping power, and are available in a 20-count package. They feature jacketed hollow point bullets and nickel-plated shellcases, making them easily distinguishable from the training ammunition.



The W Train and Defend system will include the following offerings:<strong></strong>



<strong>W Train &amp; Defend–T (Train)</strong>

      <![CDATA[The other morning, I was heading out for the office when I realized that I had forgotten something and had to go back into the house for minute. Unbeknownst to me, my wife had already reset the alarm, which I activated upon re-entry.



I quickly punched in the code, spoke to my wife and headed back out. Before I made it very far, my cell phone started ringing but I was unable to answer it before it went to voicemail. It was an 800 number, which made me think it was an automated response to the alarm. It had only been on for a second or two, so I didn’t really think that it had caused the security company to jump into response mode. That is until my parents called asking if everything was OK. They had received a call from an actual person about our alarm going off.



I realized I had better call and let my wife know that the police might show up. Unfortunately, it was too late. My wife answered the phone with a “is that you at the door?” I responded that it was probably the police. It was, and they were very polite about the misunderstanding (I think the two crying kids in the background helped). It also, however, got me to thinking about police response time if there had been a problem.



Timing the incident from the moment that the alarm screamed its warning to the police pounding on the door was only about 10 minutes. That is an excellent response time, which I’ve found is pretty standard for my local police force. The time I called about a noise complaint, the responding officer arrived in about seven minutes.



However, seven to 10 minutes can seem like a very long time when you’re huddled in the safe room waiting for help. This is the greatest reason why you should have a home-defense plan in place. While it’s a major cliché the saying “when seconds count, police are only minutes away” is very true. <a title="Learn more about developing a home-defense plan.

    <title>Two Tips to Strengthen Your Defensive Mind</title>

      <![CDATA[Self-defense trainers speak often of “mindset,” and how the brain is the best defensive tool we have. We all know that being aware of our surroundings helps us to identify dangers, and possibly avoid problems altogether. On the other end of the spectrum, many criminals have specifically-and successfully-targeted the clueless, the distracted and the unprepared.



But how exactly do we increase our awareness to achieve “Combat Mindset?” Reading and talking about it isn’t enough, especially since it should be thought of as a lifestyle, not just a specific skill. Ideally, the mechanisms that can keep you safe should be engaged as much of the time as possible-we’re not just talking about working out for an hour or two a day.



There are many ways to sharpen your mind’s focus on what’s going on around you. The best will help you take in your surroundings, and more important, actually register what you are seeing and evaluate it. It’s too easy for the eyes and mind to simply pass over elements in the environment, especially since we’re bombarded with more and more stimuli every day.



To get you started, here are two simple exercises that will improve your ability to analyze your surroundings:<strong></strong>



<strong>Priority Awareness Zone</strong>

Imagine that you are the center of a 15-yard diameter circle. Look all around you-the entire 360 degrees-and evaluate each of the people within 7 or 8 yards of you. Start with those closest to you, and move out to your 8-yard radius. See anything unusual or noteworthy? Next, scan the same area, and see if you can pick out anything that could be used as a defensive tool-somewhere to hide, something that can be used as a shield or anything that can be used to strike. Finally, examine the same area and determine your best exit routes. For extra credit add the area above you, for a 540-degree awareness zone!



<strong>Head to Toe</strong>

Pick a person in your Priority Awareness Zone and describe that person in detail, paying particular attention to his or her most distinctive features-as if you might have to explain the person to the police. This helps you look more closely at people and process more information about them.



Since the first line of defense is avoiding a problem, good situational awareness is your first objective. Incorporating these exercises into a daily mental workout will get your mind used to paying a bit more attention to your surroundings, especially in that critical area of closest proximity.]]>

      <![CDATA[Here is a <a href="http://edgerton-digital-collections.org/galleries/iconic/bullets" target="_blank">link</a> to some of Harold “Doc” Edgerton’s iconic work at MIT, where he literally invented the camera gear required to accomplish the task, with film. Digital cameras were still the stuff of science fiction when he was launching bullets, but the underlying principle has not changed.



The camera’s shutter is too slow to “freeze” the bullet on the frame, so the images are taken in a dark room with the shutter open. Laser gates, sound or black magic then triggers high-speed flashes at the right moment. As you can see in this Finnish photographer’s <a href="http://www.kuulapaa.com/home/highspeed.html" target="_blank">work</a>, the results with modern gear are stunning.



However, it’s insanely expensive, and if you’re foolish enough to attempt to build one of the new flash units on your own (the schematic is insanely simple), the amount of electricity stored makes touching the flash more dangerous than standing downrange. That rules out bullets in flight for me, at least until I hit the lottery, but I’m not going to give up taking photos at the range. Neither should you.



Last year I lucked into three photos that nearly anyone with a digital camera could  have captured-if they had it in their hands at the right time, and kept shooting. I’ve been told they’re the best I took last year (which isn’t saying much), and each and every one of them was an accident.



While at a Safariland seminar I captured the image at the top. I doubt that streak you see in the cloud of smoke is the bullet or vapor trail. If you look at the sun’s angle, it’s probably a bit of reflection from the bullet as it sped away. I would have never shot at that angle, even with the telephoto lens, but that was the only place to stand at the time.



At a 3-Gun Nation event in the summer I decided to focus on some of the shotgun targets. I kept the shutter button down and came away with maybe a dozen exploding clays.



In addition, I just happened to be behind the lens when an AR-15 spontaneously disassembled at another event. That’s getting lucky, short of the finely sandblasted finish on my camera now.



The moral of the story is to keep shooting, even when you’re not behind the trigger. Do it enough and you’ll catch some awesome memories, and if you’re lucky, freeze something special-even if it’s not a bullet in flight.

      <![CDATA[The National Rifle Association has announced the sponsors for "<a href="http://www.nraallaccess.com" target="_blank">NRA All Access,</a>" a series that premiers Sunday January 5, 2014, at 10 p.m. ET/PT on the Outdoor Channel. Along with the title sponsor Taurus are DiamondBack Airboats, Rossi, Heritage Manufacturing, Lockton Insurance, Carl Zeiss Sports Optics, Weatherby, Pyramyd Air, Hornady Manufacturing and Boyt Harness. Closed captions are provided by Legacy Quest Outdoors.



“The NRA is grateful to work with so many supporters of our country’s shooting heritage to bring NRA All Access to life,” said Executive Director of NRA General Operations Kyle Weaver. “Our family of five million members has many stories detailing the important role the NRA plays in Second Amendment issues and the outdoor lifestyle.”



“NRA All Access” is a year-round show that introduces viewers to the NRA's relationship with entertainers, athletes, veterans, and everyday gun-owning Americans who participate in the shooting sports tradition. From entertaining and educational storytelling to eye-opening exclusive interviews, audiences will get a first-hand look into the programs and people of the NRA. Each episode in the half-hour series, anchored by Matt and Jessie Duff, covers two feature stories and explores shooting concepts in a segment called Firearm Science.

    <title>Henry Repeating Arms Co. Expands Line and Capacity</title>

      <![CDATA[This is shaping up to be a big year for <a href="http://www.henryrepeating.com/index.cfm" target="_blank">Henry Repeating Arms</a>. Probably the most exciting bit of news is the introduction of the Original Henry Rifle, which will be true to the design of the vaunted 1860 Henry rifle, though chambered for the more modern .44-40 Win. cartridge.



These guns will represent the first American production of the Henry rifle in 150 years. In addition to the Original Henry, various special-edition and engraved versions of Henry’s popular firearms will be introduced this year.



In order to keep up with demand and support a larger catalog of firearms, Henry will be relying heavily on its Rice Lake, Wis., facility. Previously used to support the company’s headquarters and flagship manufacturing plant in Bayonne, N.J., the Rice Lake operation will continue to make components, but will also move into the complete production of rifles, particularly the company’s steel-constructed center-fire offerings.



The expansion is made possible by Henry’s investment in modern machinery and skilled American personnel, and supports the company’s motto that Henry rifles will be “Made in America, or not made at all.”

The series is set to include eight shotguns, two rifles and a pistol chambered in .22 LR. They come with Max-5 camo by Realtree and are branded with the Duck Commander logo. The firearms will also feature a commemorative American flag bandana, similar to the one worn by Willie Robertson on Duck Dynasty.

As for the .22 pistol, the Mossberg 715P pistol has a 26-round capacity and weighs in at about 3.5 pounds. It features a full-length top rail, red-dot sight, short vented quad-rail for-end and an A2-style muzzle break, retailing at $447. The Mossberg International 715T rifle also has a 26-round capacity and includes a top rail, 16.25-inch barrel, adjustable sights and weighs 5.5 pounds, with a retail price of $509.

    <title>A Fitting Tribute ... And An Ambush</title>

      <![CDATA[On June 6, 1944, Clarence G. “Mac” Evans was an 18-year-old rifleman in G Company, 116th Infantry Regiment, 29th Infantry Division. He stepped off the ramp of his Higgins boat into the cold water of the Atlantic before hitting the beach at the Easy Green sector of Omaha Beach. "There was nowhere to go,” he remembers, “forward was into enemy territory - backward was into the water.” To his right and left was “chaos all up and down the beach.” From the distance of almost seven decades, Mac can even now vividly describe burning vehicles, weapons full of sand, wounded and dying men. He also recalls the dead. They were “all over” – some were even floating in the water and the waves would periodically deposit them on shore among the soldiers seeking cover from enemy fire.



An NRA Life member, Mac, who left the U.S. Army as a sergeant, is now 88 years old, lives in New Orleans, La., and his story will be told in the April 2014 issue of American Rifleman in an article by historian Martin K.A. Morgan. During his Army service, Mac earned a Bronze Star, a Purple Heart and the Combat Infantryman’s Badge. And he returns to Normandy nearly every year.



What that story doesn’t tell is how we ambushed this American hero late last year, thanks to Paul Warden of America Remembers. Warden’s company, which produces a host of commemorative firearms, now offers a personalized “Distinguished Service Tribute Pistol” to honor veterans for their service through an individual commemorative pistol built on a .45 ACP Colt Government Model. When I told Paul about Mac and the upcoming article, he and staff worked with Marty and I to create a beautifully rendered .45 ACP tribute to this great American.



Well, we sandbagged him. Mac was under the impression he was just meeting up at the home of Dr. Scott and Erin Beech (who graciously hosted the “ambush”) for dinner. The accompanying video shows you the grand gentleman’s reaction. Look for more on Mac in April issue of <em>American Rifleman</em>.

        <![CDATA[A heart-warming story. Thank you. I'm glad Mr. Evans got it while he is still with us.

One comment though: The pistol handling during this award was horrendous. Not only did the presenter fail to open the action, ascertain that the chamber was empty and lock it back, several times during the presentation it appeared that he pointed the closed pistol at Mr. Evans. Please ask the sponsors to insure safe weapons handling in any future presentations. I know the pistol should be empty, but many folks are shot each year with 'empty' weapons]]>

      <![CDATA[There's no two ways around it-society is awfully reliant on technology. Of course, it's no secret that the same things that make our electronics valuable to us also have a habit of making them quite appealing to would-be thieves. Worse, modern criminals are growing increasingly tech-savvy. To help combat such threats, <a href="http://www.blackhawk.com/" target="_blank">BLACKHAWK!</a> has released a nifty line of products that are designed to make your electronics both harder to find and harder to access remotely: Under the Radar pouches and bags.



<a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/blackhawk_security_cases_i_2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-29025" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="blackhawk_security_cases_i_2" src="http://www.americanhunter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/blackhawk_security_cases_i_2-300x165.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="165" /></a>The company's Under the Radar pouches are designed to house things like your phone, tablet or passport (and credit cards, too). Anything that utilizes RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) technology will emit a slight electronic pulse-and, with the right equipment, that pulse can be used to locate and track your property. Digitally attuned bad guys might even be able to remotely access private information on your devices, too, given the opportunity.



That's where the pouches come in. They're designed to block RFID electronic transmissions. Each pouch protects your electronic devices from remote exploitation by blocking incoming and outgoing signals. Are you going to be away from your tablet or laptop for awhile? Toss it in the appropriate pouch before you store it, and it'll be infinitely more difficult for a potential cyber-crook from to stumble across it. It's as simple as that.



<strong>Pouch Features:</strong>



• Incorporates Zero Trace signal blocking technology

• Protects electronic devices from remote exploitation by blocking incoming and outgoing signals

• Helps prevent tracking of devices

• Shields against unwanted reading of RFID technology found in U.S. passports, driver’s licenses, IDs and credit cards

• Constructed of 1050 denier nylon

• Electromagnetic interior lining blocks incoming or outgoing signals with roughly 33dbm of attenuation

• Foam padding for extra protection (except Cell Phone and Oversized Cell Phone Pouches)

• Vinyl window for business card or other identification (Passport Pouch only)



<a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/blackhawk_security_bag_i_1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-29026" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="blackhawk_security_bag_i_1" src="http://www.americanhunter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/blackhawk_security_bag_i_1-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" /></a>The courier bag, meanwhile, is simply a larger option. It can house a variety of your favorite gadgets, all at once, ensuring the safety of any important data they contain. Planning to do some traveling in the coming year? The Under the Radar courier bag is an efficient and simple way to ensure that your electronics are safe, no matter how many airports and Wi-Fi hotspots you lug them through.



<strong>Courier Bag Features:</strong>

      <![CDATA[With the nation gripped in one of the coldest weather patterns in a decade, folks are bundling up when stepping out to brave extreme cold and wind chill. I slipped into multiple layers just to get to work, and realized as I tramped to the car that I might have finally found a temperature for which it is too cold to hunt.



Just to feel somewhat comfortable in the cold, I added a fleece pullover under my long, wool coat, in addition to a stocking cap and gloves. Before walking out, I wondered about my ability to reach my Kimber through the layers, especially since my shirt was tucked around the gun for concealment. If a situation happened, I would have to sweep back my coat, raise the pullover and jerk my shirt out of my pants before being able to draw to stop the threat. I quickly re-adjusted by tucking my shirt so the gun was on the outside.



While winter allows easier concealment of larger handguns, it also adds a level of difficulty in obtaining access. Thick gloves are the norm, as are zipped or buttoned coats, both of which make it harder to access and draw a handgun if needed.



Before braving the Jack Frost era of 2014, be sure to determine the best way to get to your concealed handgun and practice drawing a time or two through the heavy clothes, with an unloaded gun, to ensure you can. Of course, if you’re <a title="Learn a couple of tips on staying aware. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/two-tips-to-strengthen-your-defensive-mind" target="_blank">paying attention to your surroundings</a>, you should be able to avoid most problems, which makes the point moot anyway.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Being able to dig out your weapon in a reasonable length of time is always a good start but to complete the mission of saving your butt you now have to produce a large and deep hole in a bad guy that is dressed like you are: encased in layers of heavy and thick bullet-slowing clothing. We're not talking a couple of layers of FBI denim here! Hope you left your girly gun at home in a warm safe because today you need a man-sized cartridge, the minimum being those fat and heavy .45 rounds awaiting deployment in Rackley's Kimber. In fact, you could argue that cold winter days are made for a large-bore Magnum cartridge, a .41 or a .44. Leave the grizzly-bear loads at home, though, and load up with lighter-weight bullets. They go faster, expand more, and penetrate less. Just right for cold-weather bad guys.  ]]></comment_content>

    <title>Glock G42 .380 ACP Pocket Pistol</title>

      <![CDATA[For more than two decades, <a href="http://us.glock.com/" target="_blank">Glock</a> has been recognized as a premier provider of service-size and self-defense, polymer-framed semi-automatics. The company enjoys a world-wide reputation for manufacturing reliable, durable and easy-to-operate pistols. For the most part, Glock has focused on developing handguns primarily for military and law enforcement use. But finally, after years of being hounded by operators and civilians alike, the company has released its first pocket pistol to the American market. It's a single-stack .380 ACP called the G42.



Shrinking an existing pistol platform into a pocket pistol is no mean feat of engineering. Many manufacturers don't even try. Instead, they often design a whole new gun (or borrow someone else’s design). So it is very interesting to see how the features of the G42 have been compressed and modified, and how much of the pistol remains the same as other Glock models. The G42 is not going to be marketed as a Gen4 product. However, examining it side-by-side with examples of Gen3 and Gen4 pistols confirmed that this new gun takes its feature cues from the latest generation.



<strong>G42 Features</strong>

The G42 pistol is built to the same exacting standards as the double-stack Glocks. It has that unmistakable signature look, only smaller. The G42 is 5.94-inches long, 4.13-inches high and weighs in at 13.8 ounces unloaded, making it the smallest Glock pistol to date. It's listed as being 0.94-inches wide but it’s only this thick near the slide catch. The rest of the frame averages 0.89 inches in width, with the slide being just 0.83-inches wide.



The slide is constructed of gas-nitrate-treated steel with a matte-black finish. The 3.25-inch barrel contains hexagonal rifling, which means it should be fired with jacketed ammunition. The sights consist of the factory standard polymer white-dot front, white-bracket rear. Internally, the pistol employs the same striker, short-recoil operated, locked-breech barrel and Safe-Action trigger system as its larger compatriots. One notable change to the interior is an enlarged firing pin safety plunger with an irregular shape and a beveled surface. The recoil assembly is of the Gen4 variety with dual recoil springs, a polymer guide rod and steel supports in key locations.



The polymer frame exhibits a mix of unique and familiar features. The slide catch, magazine release and take-down lever are in their expected locations and are actually the same size and shape as those found on the Gen4 pistols. However, the frame only has one pin instead of two. The grip frame has a Gen1-style straight frontstrap, with the backstrap featuring the usual palm swell. All four sides of the grip are treated with what could best be described as a light version of the Rough Texture grip treatment. It consists of the same small, raised, blunted pyramids but with a less aggressive surface.



The grip has a small, but distinctive, downward-curving beavertail to protect the shooter's hand from the slide. The backstrap extends down below the mouth of the magazine well, nearly flush with the flat base of the drop-free, fully metal lined, six-round, single-stack magazines. This extension makes the grip a little longer, a bit more rounded and it protects the shooter’s palm from being nibbled by the movement of the magazine base during recoil.



One of the best choices the company made with the G42 was to retain the familiar trigger guard and trigger dimensions of its larger pistols. Although the trigger guard is narrower from side to side, the length, shape, finger rest and size of the trigger opening remain the same. The trigger itself is the same size and shape as the smooth-faced triggers used on the Gen4 pistols, with the same 0.49-inch travel distance. As a result, the trigger feels perfectly familiar to those who already use Glock pistols. Proof marks on the slide, barrel and frame indicate that the G42 is made at Glock’s Smyrna, Ga., facility right here in the United States.



<strong>At the Range</strong>

At the shooting range, the G42 proved to be one of the most comfortable and softest shooting pocket .380s I've wrapped my hands around. Small .380s tend to produce moderate to intense levels of felt recoil, with some loads becoming downright uncomfortable to shoot after just a few rounds. The felt recoil produced by the G42 was mild with standard pressure full-metal-jacket and defense-grade ammunition. Only when it was loaded with the hottest ammunition in the test set did it start to produce a moderate level of recoil. Most pocket rockets arrive with minimal, hard-to-see sights, so the full-size sight picture provided by the Glock factory sights was a welcome improvement. Several members of the shooting range staff gave the G42 a try, and they agreed that it is definitely a low-recoil handgun.



The specifications for this pistol indicate that it’s supposed to leave the factory with a 5.56-pound trigger. A digital trigger gauge showed that although the trigger is smooth, it cycles with 7 pounds, 3 ounces of trigger pull. Is the trigger heavier than the standard weight because it needs to be broken in, because it’s one of the first samples off of the production line or did Glock install a heavier trigger connector than the one listed in the specification? Whatever the reason, the trigger was good, but not quite as good as it could be.



The G42 was test fired with as many.380 ammunition brands that could be acquired. When enough of a particular load was available to fire five, five-shot groups, it was included in the accuracy testing. Throughout the entire test, the pistol did not experience any of the traditional ammunition failures that can occur with semi-auto pistols, such as failures to feed, stove-piped cases or un-ejected cases lodged in the chamber.



The only two events that could be noted as malfunctions occurred when firing a high-velocity, 95-grain bullet load from <a href="http://doubletapammo.net/" target="_blank">DoubleTap Ammunition</a>. Operating at velocities over 1,000 fps in pocket .380s, compared to around 880 fps with typical loads, this round caused the slide to lock open twice (as if the magazine was empty) when there were still rounds left to fire. In both cases, the chamber was clear and the next round in the magazine chambered when the slide was retracted and allowed to fall forward. This is the first time I've had a semi-auto pistol go into slide lock during a test fire. But since the G42 did not lock open with any other load, it seems that the increased pressure produced by this particular round was the source of the problem.



One of the reasons the double-stack Glock subcompacts are popular is because they are capable of producing downrange accuracy on par with the Glock Compact and Standard size pistols. Field tests of the Gen4 <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13253&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=21" target="_blank">G30S</a> (.45 ACP), <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=24789&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=21" target="_blank">G29</a> (10 mm), and the <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=25310&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=21" target="_blank">G33</a> (.357 Sig), all of which yield energetic levels of felt recoil, produced group averages hovering right around 3 inches in size when firing the pistols from a bench rest into targets placed at 25 yards.



The G42 did not demonstrate the same level of accuracy as the double-stack models, which was not wholly unexpected. Instead, the accuracy was in line with other pistols of the same size and caliber, such as the <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13147&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=21" target="_blank">Ruger LC380</a> and the <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13722&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=21" target="_blank">Taurus PT638 PRO SA</a>. Using targets set at 7 yards, the G42 produced group averages ranging around 1.5 to 2 inches in size. This is a solid level of defensive accuracy for an easy to carry, close-range defensive tool, which is how the G42 is intended to be used.



<strong>Parting Thoughts</strong>

The G42 is a pocket pistol shooting enthusiasts have been waiting for. This was an intriguing review to conduct because I am a fan of Glocks and I enjoy working with pocket pistols. As such, I was able to judge this new little single-stack from two distinct perspectives. Glocksters will feel right at home with the G42’s layout. It looks like a Glock, it operates like a Glock and it's just as reliable as the double-stack Glocks.



But what about those who are looking for a pocket pistol to use for concealed carry yet are unfamiliar with Glocks? The G42 is soft shooting, reliable and demonstrates a level of defensive accuracy as good (or better) as other semi-autos in its class. This is one of only a few pocket pistols I would feel comfortable recommending to new, small-framed or recoil-sensitive shooters. I like it so well that I'm planning to inquire if the sample provided for this test is available to purchase. I can’t give it a higher recommendation than that.<strong></strong>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[why the heck make it a single stack, they should have gone with a double stack for added uniqueness. Why should buy this when I could buy a single stacked ppk/s and more compact or a shield too...to have a glock single stack is pointless, its not like you could use this in tactical application like a 19,17,22,23,21, or 20. How about finally making a 10mm carbine that you keep shooting down!! ...On a side note the glass oxide finish is horrible!!]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[Steve I think you mean 'catch up' but whatever. Personally I hope you are wrong. Personally I hope that they have been working on this for a while to get it right instead of just cranking it out as fast as they could, resulting in poor engineering and possible recalls. I for one don't care much for .380 though there are some great ones out there. I will however be very interested in a 9mm version or possibly a comp'd version in 9mm due to the size. which I doubt we'll see since they are getting ride of the 'C' in their fullsized models.

        <![CDATA[I am a Glock owner but in truth I own a lot of other pistols that I carry concealed.  Not long ago, I spoke with an investigator in California that evens own a gun store and he claimed he investigated more accidental shootings with Glocks than any other firearm.  Simple truth, no real safety.  So, here is my prediction, since more individuals will likely carry this pistol than a full sized Glocks concealed there is going to likely be a big increase of individuals accidentally discharging this pistol thus shooting themselves or others around them.  BTW, I like the idea of this pistol, however, not sure about adding it to my collection.  Like others mentioned I would have preferred a single stack 9mm over  .380 ACP

      <comment_content><![CDATA[@Barb; If you're just using your handgun for home defense, you may want to go with a revolver. Easier to train on and much less chance of a malfunction [(]tho Glocks are notorious for not malfunctioning[)]. In the case that it does ever jam tho, you need to be trained on how to recover from it immediately, in case of a life or death situation. I revolver will not jam on you, and is much easier to maintain. Just my 2 cents. [(]I'm partial to the Ruger SP101, myself[)]]]></comment_content>

When I was goinv to get a Glock, I was told that, yes, it doesn't have a safety, but if you drop it, it won't go off like some other handguns, & it's the safest handgun out their.  I'd really like feedback from handgun owners that Do Not own a gun store & Is Nottrying to sell me a gun, just for the sake of selling one. Yes, I've shot guns for Years, so I'm mm ot a complete rookie.  Their are some terms, about the guns, that I don't understand what they mean, but like I said, I've shot them for years.  I just would like feedback from someone that is Not trying to sell me a gun & is Very Familiar with them.  THANK YOU!!<!--mobile-->]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[I worked at a large LEO firing range for over 3 yrs where over 1 million rounds were fired during a year's time, and the only time the Armorers ever worked on the Glocks [[]9's, 40's & .45's] was to add night sights or change a heavy NY or California trigger to a 5.5 pound.  The other brands of firearms were regularly being serviced for a wide variety of issues. They just didn't hold up like the Glocks.

As for the imported G25 & G28's.. they are not allowed for civilian sale inside the USA due to federal import restrictions. The G42 is manufactured / assembled in the USA so those restrictions will not apply to civilian sale. 

The people who want a small 9mm single stack pocket rocket the size of the G42 over a .380 fail to understand that it is the light felt recoil that most people are interested in. Light recoil means you get back on target faster / easier after each shot. And with modern ammo like Hornady's Critical Defense /  Critical Duty, at self defense ranges of approx. 21 feet or less... the bullets are designed to penetrate & expand on par with full power 9mm's.

So don't be so down on the little .380, after all it is basically a 9mm bullet in a ever-so-slightly shorter cartridge case . If you ever hit a bad guy 2,3,4 times in the center mass area with a rapidly fired milti-burst of quick expanding jagged hollow points... it will take the fight out of him. There aren't too many bad guys [[]even under the influence of drugs or alcohol] who would keep fighting once a lung or 2 is collapsed.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I think this pistol will potentially be a flop long term if they put the price point at $500.00+. There are too many very good manufacturers producing quality .380’s at a much more reasonable price that are very reliable. I’m sure there are many Glock enthusiasts who will disagree but to place the price so high will push away many consumers especially when there are viable substitutes. In the beginning it will seem like a hit but long term I believe most consumers will not pay $500.00+ for a .380. The other challenge will be to compete against other pistols just as small with a frame less than 1” thick, barrel 3.125”, capacity 7+1 rounds [(]6 with flush magazine[)], height 4.6”, caliber 9mm, etc. Yes, I’m talking about the M&P Shield in 9mm with a current store price of $400 - $440. When you compare that to the Glock 42 which is about the same specs one would have to ask the question why someone would pay almost $100 more [(]when you add in transfer fees + tax[)] for a .380 pistol with the same or less capacity than the M&P Shield or other subcompact 9mm that are close to the same size as the Glock 42. I think Glock has really missed the mark with this new pistol when so many of their loyal customers have been asking for a single stack subcompact 9mm for years. ]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[Thank you for the report on the Glock G42 .380cal. Glock Gen4 models are designed to provide the shooter the option to change out the mag. release and convert the handgun for left hand use. Your article was not clear whether the G42 .380 as Gen4 model. Can it be the mag. release on the G42 be converted for the left handed shooter? Your article noted the G30S .45cal. as a Gen4 model when in fact it is a Gen3 model and does not give the shooter the option with respect to the ability to convert the mag. release for left handed shooters. 
Your comments are welcome. ]]>

        <![CDATA[I think this gun will go over like a lead balloon. First why would anyone buy it when you can conceal the small Glock 9 mm gun models just as well. Also many people buy a .380 so that they can put it in a coat pocket. This gun would be unsafe to carry that way because it has no manual safety nor does it have a hard double action pull. If put in a pocket without a holster it would go off guaranteed just like the bigger Glocks do when stuffed in the waist band without a holster. No this gun makes little if any sense as it is not that much more concealable in the waist ban and not safe to carry in a pocket without a holster. 
And of course we are speaking of a weak .380 cartridge as well. Why carry a gun that is a weak .380 when you can carry a more lethal 9mm that is just as concealable. Again this .380 Glock model just does not make much sense. It may have been developed for export to foreign countries that have banned calibers like the 9mm. So with the gun in production anyway why not also sell it on the American market as well.
 People always want the 'latest and greatest' new gadget that is out without bothering to think about its more practical use, if indeed there is a practical use for it. As P.T. Barnum once said, 'There is a sucker born every minute' unfortunately his statement proved all to true since he made it many years ago.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I brought one of these glock 42 last week. First 50 rds had some stovepipes on the 2nd round.  I think my thumb was riding the slide lock lever,  This is kind of a problem for large hands and long fingers for this small pistol. Went back to range next day and it run smooth without any hicups but I was also conscious of the placement of my thumb so as not to bump the the slide lock during recoil. Yes the trigger feels like it is much heavier then 5.5 lbs.  Will measure it later. Have a bout 150 rds through it. I seems very accurate close 7 to 10 yrds.  I think the spring will make the slide a little much for most women to pull back on a regular basis. Pretty stiff for a 2 finger grip.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I had the trigger measured the other day on mine G-42 and it was 6 and 3/4 lbs.   Not as heavy as I thought. Seems the other glock connectors won't work in this model so will have to wait till someone makes the correct trigger connector for those who want a lighter trigger.  To me the double spring of the slide is pretty stiff to pull back with a two finger grip. I don't women will like this feature much unless they are super strong. The serrations on the rear of slide aren't cut deep enough for a good 2 finger grip in my opinion.]]></comment_content>

Owning Glocks are not for beginners. They aren't safe to carry loose. There is a spacer available to make them safe for carry.   I own two Glocks and they can't be beat for reliability.  I've been shooting for 68 years and will not badmouth another's choice of firearms.   If you don't know what you're talking about, don't say anything]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I've shot many brands of self defensive pistols,  1911 glock 40's 45's and smaller concealed type pistols. The Colt 380, the 22 Ruger  Mark II all have preformed well at the range and for personal protection. The only time I ever need to use a firearm was after a Cowboys game back in 1991. The people I was traveling with were happy and pleasantly drunk, I was the sober driver that night. About an hour into our return trip a can full of drunk teens started cutting into our lane. At 1st I just thought they were being jerks. Then they cut hard and hit the front of my truck more then a couple of times.  I owned a Ruger P85 at the time and put 8 rounds into the hood of their car, they took the next off ramp. I stopped a few miles down the road to report the incident. I now carry a Glock Gen 4 ,40 and the new G42 380 for self protection. Thank God I live in a state that still common sense.]]></comment_content>

I own 3 Bersa  380's which I paid around $280 for each. I could never see paying almost 3 times that much for 1 handgun. Yes and all 3 Bersa's  run just fine with 7 and 8 round magazines. Sorry glock that price needs to come way down.]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[John, ther's no doubt about it, the Bersa .380's are reliable and reasonably priced.  As I noted, i sold my Bersa as I wasn't using it, too heavy for pocket carry ,IMO.  The 42 Glock is much lighter and is my third Glock.  You're right, the Glock price is high.  However, I now will have a usable [(]for me[)] a  pocket carry pistol.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I didn't get around to reading this till today, and although I just bought a G42, I haven't had a chance to fire it yet.  Some of these comments are interesting, though - james maranki commented on 1/8 that he 'prefers the Beretta Pico.'  I'd like to know how, since it isn't even out yet?!  I read a review of it last September and got all excited and wanted one, but the review said it wouldn't be available till the 'last quarter' of 2013, so I immediately figured that meant the last week of December.  Here it is, the first week of April in 2014 and it STILL isn't out!  I even e-mailed the Berretta folks at their website a couple weeks ago to ask how soon it would be available, and I got a mealy-mouthed reply about having to meet testing deadlines, with the conclusion that even Berretta doesn't know when it will be out ... very bad marketing, which cost them this customer, at least.  It was actually one of the reasons why I got the G42.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[While reading this article, I came across the part where it was mentioned that the slide locked open while there were still rounds in the mag. This occurred when using a certain type of ammo. I watched a Hickok45 vid when the 42 did the same thing, but he was shooting a different high velocity ammo. When I practice, I use a variety of different cartridges, such as PMC, Monarch, and some factory reloads from Atlanta Arms, and Freedom Munitions. Some are round nose and some are flat nose. I have had my slide lock back while firing several different times, but not consistently, and not with any particular ammo of the ones I practice with. I am wondering if, while firing two handed, my right thumb might be pushing up on the slide lock without me noticing it. So, I am going to make an effort to make sure my right thumb is staying away from the slide lock while I'm firing. I use a +1 mag extender on the 42 from Galloway Precision, so it holds 8 rounds. My defensive rounds are: 2 rds of Lehigh Defense Maximum Expansion 68gr then 2 rds Buffalo Bore HCFN 100gr standard pressure. I alternate these on out to 8rds. Also, I load with Precision One XTP cartridges sometimes, which perform great. I have not had the slide lock problem with any of the premium cartridges, but I haven't fired as many of them. I have access to the practice cartridges, so I fire many more of them. Anyway, guys and gals, check out your right thumb position on the pistol and make sure it isn't putting pressure on the slide lock while you are firing. Just something to think about and check out. ]]></comment_content>

    <title>Sig Sauer Partners With Veterans&#039; Organization HAVA</title>

      <![CDATA[Sig Sauer has announced the company's partnership with the Honored American Veterans Afield (HAVA) organization to help wounded servicemen and women enjoy outdoor activities. A portion of sales from the new SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace will go to HAVA. The SB15 was designed by a veteran for a disabled colleague, and allows people with reduced upper body strength to comfortably shoot pistol versions of the AR-15 platform.



“HAVA has been at the forefront of helping American servicemen and women get back into the shooting sports, and we’re huge supporters of this effort,” said Sig Sauer Vice President of Marketing Bud Fini. “We’ve seen firsthand the positive impact from getting these veterans back to the activities they love and we’re just thrilled to be able to help this program.”



“SIG SAUER has been a supporter of HAVA, going back to some of the first range events,” said HAVA’s Chief Executive Officer Tom Taylor. “We’ve always thought the Sig brand was a perfect fit for the wounded warriors we serve. And now they are a HAVA sponsor at the highest level with financial support, firearms, volunteers, and a product that is functional for disabled shooters.”



Sig Sauer will provide firearms for HAVA range events and hunts, as well as certificates for fundraising raffles. The company's staff will be on hand to help during range days, and when available Sig Sauer's shooting team captain Max Michel will make appearances to help coach HAVA participants.

      <![CDATA[Jerry Brown, 63, was outside his cabin when he spotted a large black bear. The bear first headed away from Brown, but then turned toward him and attacked. As Brown tried to escape, his brother, Randy, retrieved a firearm and shot at the bear, causing it to run off. Brown suffered extensive injuries to his face, including the loss of his left eye. It was reported that Brown was in serious, but stable, condition and recovering from his injuries.<em> (</em><a href="http://www.grandforksherald.com/" target="_blank"><em>Grand Forks Herald</em></a>, Shell Lake, WI, 6/20/13)

      <![CDATA[“They don’t make ‘em like they used to,” has become something of a cliché in today’s handgunning circles. Usually it accompanies the display of a treasured handgun, maybe a cool Luger brought home by a World War II doughboy or a Registered Magnum from the 1930s. The best handguns of yesteryear seem to take on an almost mystical aura of reliability, accuracy and handling. Sometimes it gets downright silly, like the handgunner who insisted that an original 1870s 7 ½-inch Peacemaker .45 balances better than one made this year. Most of this is just a human tendency to revere that which is old and has survived, but you also have to consider that they really <em>don’t </em>make them like they used to.



In the days when Lugers were new and that superb blue finish was meticulously applied, labor was cheap. It cost a little more when <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CustomContentDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=750001&amp;catalogId=750051&amp;content=11001" target="_blank">Smith &amp; Wesson</a> picked its best fitters to build those original Registered Magnums, but they made several thousand of them before WWII. The best quality handguns made anywhere in the world in that pre-war period showed a lot of careful polishing and fitting, all done by hand. The parts were forged steel of the highest quality and the designs reflected up-to-date engineering, but the guns were great because they were put together by hand. In that time, it was how it was done. The first of the WWII M1911A1 pistols made for the government by Colt were as good as pre-war commercials, but when the pressure was on for guns for the troops, we got Parkerizing. They were ugly, but no battlefield encounter was ever decided by the degree of shininess of the weapons involved. There is a point to be made here. A gun is a tool and should be respected for what it can do and not for what it looks like.



As a matter of fact, the guns on dealer’s shelves today tend to have business-like finishes, but they are designed to go together without hand fitting. In these times, human labor is very expensive, so the factories go to great lengths to find ways to make good, workable handguns with a minimum of human effort. This keeps the cost down so they can sell more guns. If the guns actually sell well, everyone is happy. In essence you not only get what you pay for, you get what you ask for. When today’s defensive shooter goes shopping for a home-protection handgun, he or she is looking for a tool, not a family heirloom.  From an economic point of view, companies would-and could-build heirlooms. But they would have to be assured that there was a strong and continuing demand for such things.]]>

Initial news says it is based on a very old design and updated or upgraded to modern needs or wants.  And S&W’s Classic revolver series.  Attractive firearms as well as functional.  Some of us just do not like black plastic frame guns.  Some of us are drawn to that attractiveness of the guns of old.  If the industry will follow S&W’s and Remington’s lead, maybe we could have some functional and attractive firearms based on old designs.  Now, how about an updated version of the Colt Model M 1903/1908 with an aluminum frame, DAO with the concealed hammer.  Even if only in .380 ACP.  Maybe even stainless.  Functional, attractive and classic.]]></comment_content>

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.taurususa.com/index.cfm" target="_blank">Taurus</a> has introduced a new five-shot revolver that it calls the View, named because of its translucent side plate on the right side of the revolver that bares the interior mechanisms.



Based on the Model 85, the View features a contoured grip and grip frame designed to not print when worn inside fitted clothing. The grip is also designed to sit back in the palm to reduce muzzle lift, and has a curvature in the shape to minimize thickness and increase comfort.



The titanium cylinder and snubnose barrel keep the revolver ultra light in weight (approx. 9 ounces unloaded) while increasing its strength. The stainless-steel ejector rod is shortened for easy carry. The Taurus View boasts a 10-pound trigger, and the non-adjustable sight is aligned for point-of-aim/point-of-impact shooting at close-quarter distances.



<strong>Caliber:</strong> .38 Spl.

<strong>Capacity:</strong> 5 rounds

<strong>Barrel Length:</strong> 1.41”

<strong>Overall Length:</strong> 5.67”

<strong>Overall Height:</strong> 3.5”

<strong>Overall Width:</strong> 1.35”

<strong>Weight:</strong> 9 ounces unloaded; 17 ounces loaded

<strong>Sights:</strong> Fixed

<strong>Safety:</strong> Transfer Bar, Taurus Security System

<strong>Frame:</strong> Aluminum

<strong>Barrel:</strong> Titanium with liner steel

<strong>Cylinder:</strong> Titanium

<strong>Mechanism Plate:</strong> Polycarbonate

<strong>Finish:</strong> Colored Aluminum

<strong>Suggested Retail Price:</strong> $599]]>

      <![CDATA[When it came to geometry, I used every angle possible to get out of class. Therefore, it was no coincidence I started sweating bullets during an optics seminar that went off on a mathematical tangent.



I’m glad it did, though. The technology packed into modern riflescopes may be a sine (that’s a joke for those who didn’t ditch class) of the times, but harnessing all that power still comes down to some common sense.



If you’re finicky about your setup you should find a riflescope’s mechanical zero before it is mounted. The reason comes down to geometry so basic I’d never given it any thought.



My explanation is grossly oversimplified, but it’s easy to visualize what’s going on when you look through a scope. The field of view is a circle and at its center you find the intersection of stadia lines called the crosshair.



Now, imagine the vertical line moving to the left, while the field of view remains stationary. The line becomes shorter and shorter as it moves away from the center, limiting the amount of hold over or hold under available.



When looking through a traditional scope, you always see a circle with the crosshair centered perfectly. Internally, though, the assembly that projects the image back to your eye moves slightly within the tube every time you dial for windage or elevation. Space inside is limited, so if you go far enough one way or the other the amount of adjustment available on the turrets diminishes-just like the vertical stadia line got shorter as we envisioned it moving from the field of view’s center. It’s the old “longest line in a circle must pass through the center rule” I missed because I was out with the “flu.”



So to maintain the maximum number of elevation and windage clicks available on your scope, start by finding mechanical zero before mounting. To do that, count the total number of windage “clicks” (one at a time), until you’ve gone fully from one adjustment stop to the other. Then do it again to double check your findings. Take my word for it, once you’ve hit 264 clicks it’s easy to lose count. Do the same for elevation. Don’t trust markings on the turret. Divide both in half, and that’s the respective number of clicks to dial back into the scope (from the stops). Now your reticle should be at the midpoints, mechanical zero-but if it was way off in the first place you may need to double check.



The explanation is obliquely oversimplified, I admit. And, nearly all scopes I’ve ever tested come from the manufacturer at mechanical zero.



So why invest the time? Some sporting goods employees like to make clicking noises while talking to customers, and when ballpoint pens are scarce, turrets are often used. Then there’s vibration during shipment and oversights at the factory.



The experts seem to disagree on this one, but I have a tendency to agree with the <a href="http://www.leupold.com" target="_blank">Leupold</a> instructor at the seminar. To some degree you’ll also be lapping in those extremely small gears.]]>

    <title>7 Way to Improve Self-Defense Handgun Skills</title>

      <![CDATA[<em>This story first appeared in <a href="http://www.secondcalldefense.org/self-defense-news/7-ways-improve-your-self-defense-handgun-skills" target="_blank">Self-Defense News</a> at <a href="http://www.secondcalldefense.org/" target="_blank">Second Call Defense</a>. </em>



While there should never be a training requirement to exercise your Second Amendment right, training is nevertheless a good idea.



First, knowing how to use a firearm safely and effectively will pay off if you're ever in a situation where your life depends on your shooting skill. Second, the more training you have, the more likely you are to avoid mistakes that could lead to legal troubles.



You can use any kind of firearm to defend yourself, but the overwhelming popular choice in America is the handgun. So here are seven suggestions for learning handgun shooting skills, from a basic level up through more advanced levels.



<strong>Take a Basic Pistol Course</strong>

A basic pistol course will teach you about safety rules, gun handling, pistol types, marksmanship fundamentals, firing positions, cleaning and storage. You'll also get a chance to shoot one or more pistols on a firing range. Even if you have some experience with firearms, it's a good idea to take a course like this as a refresher.



You can contact local ranges for available courses or search the <a href="http://www.nrainstructors.org/searchcourse.aspx" target="_blank">NRA database of certified firearm instructors and courses</a>.



<strong>Go through the NRA Marksmanship Qualification Program</strong>

This is a do-it-yourself course that helps you develop your shooting skills. You are given a series of challenges that grow progressively more difficult, from the beginner level up to sharpshooter. There's no cost involved, other than range fees and whatever you spend on paper targets.



<a href="http://mqp.nra.org/documents/pdf/education/training/marksmanship/qualbook.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Download the entire program as a PDF document</a>. In addition to the pistol program, you'll find separate programs for various types of rifles and shotguns.



<strong>Get Your CCW License</strong>

In most states, you need a permit or license to carry a concealed handgun outside your home. Licensing requirements often include classroom instruction on the law and some range time with your handgun. Whether or not you plan to carry your firearm, this is good training to have. Time spent on the range drawing from a holster is especially helpful, since this introduces more realism into your self-defense experience.



A good place to start is by visiting the website of your state's Attorney General. Here's a list of <a href="http://www.naag.org/" target="_blank">all the AGs in the United States</a>.



<strong>Take Advanced Self-Defense Courses</strong>

Once you're comfortable with the basics, it's time to start challenging yourself. This can include drawing from concealment, firing at moving targets, engaging multiple targets, reloading, one-handed drills, and moving and shooting. At the more advanced levels, you can learn shooting in low light, moving around corners, partner drills and other skills.



These courses generally have names such as advanced pistol shooting, advanced concealed carry, home defense, defense outside the home and so on. At this level, it's particularly important to choose experienced and knowledgeable instructors. So ask around for references.



<strong>Practice Dry Fire at Home</strong>

In most places, you can't discharge a firearm within city limits. And you probably don't want to shoot up your home. So on days you can't make it to a shooting range, conducting dry fire drills is a way to get in some practice. All you really need is your unloaded handgun and a paper target. However, there are a variety of lasers, electronic targets and other nifty gadgets than can help make dry fire more fun.



<strong>Enter Local Bullseye Matches</strong>

The official name of this activity is NRA Conventional Pistol Shooting, but it's usually referred to as "bullseye" by most people. Matches generally take place at local ranges and consist of slow fire, timed fire and rapid fire stages where you compete for points on standard targets. Bullseye requires accuracy and trigger control, while introducing a little extra stress during the timed and rapid fire stages.



You can generally use an inexpensive .22 pistol and a minimum of equipment for indoor matches. For outdoor matches, you will need at least two different guns, a .22 and a .45 caliber, along with a little more gear. <a href="http://www.bullseyepistol.com/" target="_blank">The Encyclopedia of Bullseye Pistol</a> provides an in-depth source of information for this fun activity.



<strong>Compete in IDPA or IPSC Matches</strong>

For competition that's more closely related to real-world self-defense, you should consider IDPA (International Defensive Pistol Association) or IPSC (International Practical Shooting Confederation) matches. This is a kind of competition where you are given scenarios involving shooting from cover, rescuing hostages, engaging multiple targets, shooting on the move, etc. While no competition can totally prepare you for the stark reality of a self-defense situation, IDPA and IPSC come about as close as you can get and still maintain safety.



It's probably a good idea to watch a few matches before you try to enter one of these competitions. They're not complicated, but can be a challenge for the beginner. You can find out more about <a href="http://www.idpa.com/" target="_blank">IDPA here</a> and <a href="http://www.ipsc.org/" target="_blank">IPSC here</a>.]]>

    <title>Remington’s New Old Model 51</title>

      <![CDATA[<em>“…fits your palm like the hand of a friend.”</em>



Thus read Remington’s advertising as the old-line gunmaker embarked on the promotion of a new pistol. It was 1918 and the bold pronouncement was no idle boast. The company’s new pistol was designed to compete with other guns from Colt, S&amp;W, H&amp;R and Savage, as well as many Europeans. Legendary designer John Pedersen applied his considerable skills to developing a pocketable defensive automatic pistol and the result was the Model 51. Long before gun writers began to bandy about the term “ergonomics,” Pedersen’s slick little .32/.380 had ergos for the ages. It was an all-steel, single-column, 7+1 with multiple safety features. Pedersen’s efforts produced a very useful pocket auto. It had a unique breech locking system and a shape that seemed to fit every hand. But it was an expensive gun to make and <a href="http://remington.com/" target="_blank">Remington</a> discontinued the model in 1927. The company did not make a true repeating handgun until its recent introduction of a 1911 style pistol a couple of years ago.



That is until Remington invited a group of gun writers to Gunsite just before Christmas of 2013. Many new products were introduced, but the highlight was a new version of that decades-old Model 51. It is called the Model R51 and there’s no doubt where the name originated. Although there are many changes, the R51 of 2014 bears a strong resemblance to the older gun. It has a very similar butt shape and grip angle. In the hand, it feels much the same. Inside, the locking system is also inspired by the earlier gun. Engineered from the beginning to take the .40 S&amp;W cartridge, the R51 initially goes on sale as a 9 mm Luger. Understandably, it is slightly thicker.



In a marketplace loaded with many different kinds of trigger systems and safety arrangements, the R51 is different. It is an <em>internal </em>hammer single-action. The hammer has no spur and cannot be manually cocked. When the slide cycles, the hammer cocks and there is no means of decocking it. The trigger is of the pivoting type and has a relatively short reset. Trigger pull is about 5 ½ pounds. We were allowed to shoot the guns as much as we desired at Gunsite and I found the little R51 to handle well. It is decently accurate and malfunctions were few in this batch of pre-production prototypes. I am promised an early specimen for T&amp;E as early as January. When it arrives, it will get the usual detailed examination and shooting evaluation. At this point, it looks very good.



Clearly, this pistol is an effort to penetrate the concealed-carry handgun market. It is a good-looking new gun with all the weight of a major gunmaker behind it. Bucking the trends, the R51 is a true single-action, is all metal and has no active safety to release before firing. I was guaranteed that the R51 will pass any drop test. It is priced “right at four hundred bucks.” Now that is interesting.

SA, DAO, SA/DA, striker fired - those alone are not the deciding factors for safe gun carry.  Trigger pull/weight, holsters, location, training, etc all factor in. 



This gun with a proper holster appears to be a perfectly safe carry option.<!--mobile-->]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[This gun was one of the high points of the just held 2014 SHOT Show. True “mini” guns of all types [(]revolvers and pistols[)] in calibers of all kinds were seen throughout the huge convention floor but many of them seem to sacrifice fit and feel [(]obviously, both subjective considerations[)] for flatness. I have long been a fan of thin guns for concealment but several notable manufacturers seem to have missed the point. Everything is a tradeoff but square edges and the lack of anything remotely capable of matching the shape and inside surfaces of the closed hand seem like a real mistake to me. But it is certainly not a mistake that Remington is making. This is a really neat gun. Perfect? No. But a cool design based on a legendary one. It obviously remains to be seen how production guns will perform [(]and to be honest, a few eyebrows were raised when shooting samples were apparently only available on the second of two range days at SHOT – two days being something new at the Show this year[)] but so far, things seem pretty good. By the way, and this is not meant to be critical of “lee” [(]below[)] for I too, was told some weeks back that the retail price would be somewhere around $380-$390 but at the Show, Remington was telling people it would now go for $420, which still seems like a pretty good deal to me. Additionally, and expanding upon Mr. Clapp's remarks [(]above[)] that the gun was 'Engineered from the beginning to take the .40 S&W cartridge, the R51 initially goes on sale as a 9 mm Luger.', it should be noted that the four or five guns I examined at SHOT were all marked '9mm Luger +P'; an interesting way of answering that question [(]of the average consumer[)] upfront. Finally, and again not meaning to be argumentative or disrespectful of previous posters to this thread but in an industry all but ruled by common sense, good sense, personal safety, and concerns over liability, I really don’t think an old line company like Remington that’s owned by a parent company comprised of a very responsible group of investors, would offer a firearm [(]ultimately overseen by a respected and experienced handgun product manager[)] that would be as dangerous as believed by some here on this page. Of course, only time will tell that.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Ultimate solution to any safety issues with this gun is to simply carry it with no round in the chamber, and manually rack the slide upon draw when needed. No big deal. With that simple rule in place, gun is perfectly viable. Anyone willing to keep it with one up the pipe assumes full liability for that, and not Remington. Hence their rationale for marketing it. I'm sure there's no room to design a 1911 style manual safety into its confined internal space. But it would be nice to see Remington R and D engineer a slide mounted manual hammer block for it. Then it would be ideal. Other than this, looks like an interesting gun. Video on the Remington website was intriguing.]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[Carrying the pistol with no round in its chamber is the safe way to carry a single-action semiauto with no exposed hammer,  and over some 100 years when such pistols were pretty common in the United States, it became the standard way. But it makes the pistol less useful.  In an emergency one hand may be occupied fending off an attacker, or the attacker may have seized one arm, or one arm may have been injured in the confrontation or be in a sling from some previous injury, or the person being attacked may be using one arm to hold something that can't be put down, such as a small child.  
Furthermore, many people by their middle years contract arthritis or other medical conditions, which make them unable to manipulate a slide very quickly if at all. I believe this shortcoming of design is the reason this type of pistols fell out of popularity, though  many of them were of very high quality. Attempts to reintroduce similar designs, such as the AMT Backup, met with much disinterest in the market. I expect to see this new gun meet a similar fate.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Several of the posts/comments show that either most of you did NOT read Wiley Clapp's article , or you are still eating sugar-frosted flakes for breakfast and live with your mommy still. { I do think there should be an external safety [(] like the Hi-power or the 1911 has [)] since it does not have an external hammer }. Upside : It is made of metal instead of the silly plastic-poly trash guns - which are priced very high , yet can melt. ]]></comment_content>

Even with the grip safety, I can see possible problem with carrying one with one in chamber..  In putting it in pocket, the grip safety could be engaged as you are pushing it into pocket. Then should trigger get caught somehow, the gun could discharge..  One would need to use extreme caution or just carry it without one chambered.<!--mobile-->]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA['Carrying the pistol with no round in the chamber is the safe way to carry a single-action semiauto' is a nonsensical statement.  I guess Mr. Hopkins has never carried a 1911 locked and cocked.  The key to safe carry for this pistol is the 5+ lb trigger pull coupled with safe gun handling training/skills such as 'keep your booger hook off the bang switch until on target.'

World of difference in a cocked-and-locked 1911 in a holster, and a cocked and unlockable that most are going to carry in a pocket. Were they not going to pocket it, there would be no reason to buy such a compact pistol. Longer guns are easier to shoot accurately. ]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I use a Model 1919-made Remington Model 51 that had been used years ago by the Delaware State Police in some function as my primary concealed carry firearm. I also found a brand new one made in 1919 that I don't use for anything....just keep! I'm sorry they just did not remake the original one! Both of mine are in .380. I don't use anything but FMJ ammo in the 90+ year old handgun as that was the ammo it was designed for. Looks like they kept the grip safety. They are correct: It will not discharge by dropping it. If I want to lower the hammer for storage or non-use time, I put in a snap cap and pull the trigger. I have never had a failure to function with my old ones. It is a locked, short recoil design. One of the few [(]if any[)] made for the smaller calibers. The word is that this was the best concealed carry semi-auto ever made. Let's hope the new versions are as good!]]></comment_content>

    <title>Glock G41 Gen4 Pistol</title>

      <![CDATA[Recently, <a href="http://us.glock.com/" target="_blank">Glock</a> has been expanding its product lines by developing hybrid pistols that blend the features of two existing models. In 2013, the company released the model <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13253&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=21" target="_blank">G30S</a> subcompact .45 ACP by combining the reduced-weight slide of the <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13615&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=21" target="_blank">G36</a> Slimline with the increased ammunition capacity of the double-stack G30 SF frame. For 2014, Glock is launching the G41, which takes its cues from both the G21 Gen4 and the G34 Gen4 Practical Tactical models.



The G41 is a .45 ACP Safe-Action semi-auto pistol with a full-size (Standard) Gen4 frame and an extended black gas-nitrate finished slide. Most long-slide pistols are fitted with slides that have identical dimensions to a standard-length slide with the exception of the additional length at the muzzle end. As a result, long-slides are typically heavier than the standard model due to the extra metal in the slide and barrel. In the case of Glock's lengthier G34 (9 mm) and G35 (.40 S&amp;W), the company chose to cut out a portion of the slide between the front sight and the chamber in order to keep the pistol's overall weight in line with the standard-length models.



But instead of following this pattern of stretch-and-cut slide design for the new G41, the company used a different approach. Designers reduced the weight by using a narrower, thinner-walled slide with external dimensions much like those of the G34, albeit a fraction of an inch longer. The result is an upper assembly with enough room for a 5.31-inch extended, octagonal-rifled barrel, no cut out in the top of the slide and an overall pistol weight that’s 2.84-ounces lighter than the standard G21.



The G41 sight system employs a factory-standard polymer white-dot front sight and a polymer white-bracket rear sight containing two adjustment screws for windage. The slide features an extractor with a square protrusion that acts as both a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator. The recoil assembly is of the Gen4 variety, with a polymer guide rod, dual recoil springs and steel supports.



The rest of the pistol, including the trigger, frame and magazines, are all lifted directly from the Gen4 version of the G21 service-size .45 ACP pistol. The smooth-faced trigger required 5 pounds, 6 ounces of trigger pull to cycle, according to a Lyman's digital trigger gauge. As a Safe-Action pistol, the G41 contains the same three independent passive safeties found in other Glock models, including a trigger safety, firing pin safety and a drop safety.



The two-pin frame houses the take-down lever, slide catch and magazine release in the usual locations. The enlarged magazine release button is reversible for left-handed operators. A full-size, molded-in Picatinny compatible accessory rail can be used to support a wide variety of light and laser modules. This pistol has textured finger grooves along the frontstrap of the grip with the Gen4 Rough Texture blunted pyramids surface treatment on the backstrap and sides of the grip. This new texture is more aggressive than the Gen3 version but not overly abrasive for bare hands.



The G41 arrives in a hard case with a total of three 10- or 13-round magazines, depending on local regulations. Two interchangeable backstraps and an installation tool are also included. With no backstrap installed, the frame presents the smallest grip size, which is a 0.08-inch reduction in the distance to the trigger compared to the Gen3 frame. Adding the small backstrap brings the frame back to the original Gen3 size, while the installation of the larger backstrap adds an extra 0.08 inches for shooters with bigger hands.



Despite their rugged reliability, Glocks benefit from regular maintenance and proper lubrication just as much as any other handgun. For conducting inspections, routine cleaning or installing upgrades, the <a href="http://www.presentarmsinc.com/defaultnew.aspx" target="_blank">Present Arms, Inc.</a> Gunner's Mount Inspection Plate Pro makes it easy to work on the frame and keep track of the various small bits and pieces. This compact work station arrives with a heavy-duty PVC base plate with part-retaining pockets and grooves, one magazine well post to hold the frame in an upright position, and a post swivel that allows the frame to rotate 360-degrees on the plate. Posts are available for a variety of pistols, including the Glock double-stack in 9 mm, .40 S&amp;W, and .45 ACP models. It’s a system that comes in handy for professional gunsmiths and shooting hobbyists alike.



The most notable characteristic of the G41 at the shooting range is how light and well balanced it is for a long-slide .45 ACP. With a fully loaded 13-round magazine, it feels like the gun ends at the trigger guard. In other words, it points and swings like a short-barreled semi-auto instead of a typical long-slide pistol. The trigger cycled smoothly and the pistol ran flawlessly with test ammunition ranging from steel-cased imports to defense-grade +P hollow points.



But there's one advertising point for the G41 that did not play out in the course of testing. A press release from Glock states, “The longer barrel and slide on the G41 Gen4 helps to reduce muzzle flip and felt recoil...." This would be true if the elongation of the G41s upper assembly resulted in the usual increase of mass but this is not the case.



A while back, I teamed up with the folks at <a href="http://www.lonewolfdist.com/" target="_blank">Lone Wolf Distributors</a> to convert a stock Gen3 G21 4.60-inch barrel pistol into a 6-inch long-slide using after-market parts. The pistol's weight jumped from 29.8-ounces with an empty magazine to 33.5-ounces with the Lone Wolf components installed. Even though the extra 1.4-inches of barrel length allowed bullets to develop a bit more velocity before leaving the muzzle, the extra 3.7 ounces of weight in the upper assembly reduced felt recoil to a degree. Swapping out the Gen3 polymer-rod recoil assembly with a 17-pound spring for a steel rod with a 20-pound spring reduced the recoil even more.



The G41, when weighed with an empty magazine, tipped the scale at 26.8 ounces. This means it weighs 6.7-ounces less than the Lone Wolf long-slide, and 3-ounces less than the G21 with a 4.6-inch factory-standard barrel. Since the G41 is equipped with the same recoil springs as the G21 Gen4,  and the bullets fired are gaining a little more velocity due to a 0.71-inch longer barrel, then the lighter slide is going to transmit more felt recoil, not less, to the operator’s hands.



During live-fire testing, the G41’s levels of felt recoil were generally on par with the <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13714&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=21" target="_blank">G21</a> but in some cases it exhibited more recoil and muzzle rise. This increase in intensity is slight, and by no means a deal breaker, but it is something to be aware of. While it’s an enjoyable pistol to work with, it does not behave like a reduced-recoil .45.



The G41 proved to be a top-notch performer for an out-of-the-box pistol when it came to accuracy testing, which consisted of the usual benchrested five, five-shot groups fired into targets placed at 25 yards. When testing the then brand-new 4.6-inch barrel G21 Gen4, it turned in respectable group averages ranging 2.75 to 3.3 inches in sizes. The 5.31-inch barrel and extended sight radius of the G41 provided a measurable improvement, keeping the group averages below the 3-inch mark.



The best performing ammunition of the test was the <a href="http://store.chencustom.com/" target="_blank">ASYM</a> 230-grain Match Hardball full-metal-jacket load, which was developed specifically for competitive shooting. This round produced the best single five-shot group of 1.91 inches along with the best five-group average of 2.14 inches. <a href="http://www.hornady.com/" target="_blank">Hornady's</a> Critical Duty 220-grain FlexLock +P ammunition yielded an average of 2.49 inches, followed by <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester</a> 230-grain PDX1 bonded hollow points at 2.87 inches.



The G41 is a welcome addition to the Practical Tactical line of Glock pistols for fans of the .45 ACP. Some competition shooters will mourn the absence of the slide cut out because the solid slide precludes the installation of 4-port competition barrels. Others won't mind the solid slide because the G41 is so well-balanced, reliable and accurate right out of the box. For the operators and self-defenders, this pistol's increased sight radius and reduced-weight slide make it a solid choice for use as an on-duty sidearm or for home-defense.

      <![CDATA[So, in some ways, it is Groundhog Day. I have arrived in Las Vegas for the 2014 Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade Show. It is something like my 22nd, maybe 23rd, as one tends to lose count. There were familiar faces at the airport and in the hotel lobby, many of whom I have not seen face-to-face since last year. While the faces may be familiar, the guns that will be unveiled tomorrow will not. Many I have kept under wraps, waiting until the companies that make them were ready to go public.



Tomorrow is Media Day at the Range, the officially sanctioned event and where you will find most of the major-and quite a few minor-companies in the firearms industry. It is my plan to slip out mid-day and hit the SIG Sauer event after the main Media Day. There are quite a few new SIGs you will see and get our impressions of at quitting time on Monday but we cannot reveal at present.



Tomorrow is the first time prototypes and production models of the new firearms, ammunition and accessories will be handed to the firearm press. Quite a few new and interesting designs will be released, and NRA’s <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blog_list.php?cat_id=12463">E-Media coverage</a> will be will worth staying tuned to for the latest in guns and gear.]]>

      <![CDATA[Because it's never too late to get into the .380 game, Kimber has introduced a micro 1911 pocket pistol. Perfect for carry and self-defense, the gun comes with Crimson Trace grips, although conventional irons sights are also an option. Take a look as Sheriff Jim Wilson as he fires off a magazine during Media Day at SHOT Show 2014.

      <![CDATA[Valentine's Day is still a month away, yet Kimber and GEMTECH have partnered for what must might prove to be a perfect pairing. While you might recognize the TLE, check out the new threaded-barrel version, the Custom TLE II TFS (threaded for suppression) and the GEMTECH suppressor, which it calls the "G-Core." These handguns are still available in 9 mm and .45 ACP, with 9- and 7-round capacities, respectively.



Watch Sheriff Jim Wilson run this duty and defense gun at Media Day at the Range during SHOT Show 2014. For more, visit <a href="http://kimberamerica.com">KimberAmerica</a>.

      <![CDATA[Based on the popular PPQ, <a href="http://www.waltherarms.com" target="_blank">Walther's</a> PPQ M2 has established itself as one of the company's most successful handguns. Now Walther fans will have the opportunity to own a PPQ chambered in .22LR.



The new PPQ .22 will be available with either a four- or five-inch barrel and will be shipped with a 12-round magazine. It has the potential to serve as a very effective training pistol for anyone that already owns its "big brothers," which are chambered in 9 mm and .40 S&amp;W, respectively.



Learn more about the PPQ .22 in the video below, hosted by Sheriff Jim Wilson.

      <![CDATA[It’s no secret that 3-gun has become one of the fastest growing shooting sports in decades. Like any sport, the nature of the competition has driven the development and specialization of equipment used by the participants.



While handguns and, to an extent, rifles have already evolved as tools for the practical shooter, the shotgun had a long way to go before it was “race ready.” Now we are seeing purpose-built, practical, competition shotguns being developed by major manufacturers. The <a href="http://www.beretta.com" target="_blank">Beretta</a> 1301 Competition is the World’s oldest gunmaker’s foray into the emerging world of 3-Gun.



Get a closer look at the 1301 Competition with the video embedded below.

      <![CDATA[President and CEO of Rock Island Armory, Martin Tuason, took the time to talk about the company's 22 TCM at SHOT Show 2014's Media Day at the Range.



This year Rock Island will be releasing a single-stack, concealed-carry pistol designed exclusively for the Armscor 22TCM ammo, as well as continuing production of the original TCMs with the 9 mm conversion and the high capacity, 17-round dedicated TCMs. You can expect some serious stopping power from the 40-grain hollow point at about 10 inches in ballistic gel. The 22 TCM ammunition has hardly any recoil making for a lighter firearm.

With the SR-762, Ruger adds to the ever-growing AR-style rifle market, this time in the highly sought-after 7.62 NATO/.308 Win. Watch as Joe Kurtenbach walks through the features of Ruger's latest rifle offering and then takes it downrange.

      <![CDATA[Who says revolvers are yesterday's news? Ruger's new GP100 is causing all sorts of buzz, and for good reason. Borrowing some of the best features of the <a href="http://http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13705&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=23">Wiley Clapp/TALO Ruger GP100</a>, including rear Novak sights, there are some other head-turning specs, such as Hogue stippled hardwood grips, that will no doubt pique the interest of the modern shooter. Check out the video as Sheriff Jim Wilson runs through the list of features that has revived one already-very-popular revolver.

      <![CDATA[<div>



<a href="http://www.kimberamerica.com/" target="_blank">Kimber</a> had no shortage of high-quality rifles on the line at SHOT Show 2014's Media Day at the Range, and its new Model 8400 Advanced Tactical II was among them.



Hand-built, tested for exceptional accuracy and loaded with custom features that are designed to enhance field performance, the Advanced Tactical II is chambered in both .308 Win. and .300 Win. Mag. It includes a 5-round detachable magazine, with additional 5 and 10-round magazines available as accessory items.



The Manners MCS-TF4 folding stock aids rapid deployment, features an adjustable comb and also adjusts for length-of-pull. The extended pistol grip is stippled for a secure grip regardless of field conditions and the stock is finished in brown camouflage that blends in to a variety of environments.



The Advanced Tactical II is available in limited quantities from over 2,000 Kimber Master Dealers across America. Suggested retail price is $3,899.



Learn more about the Advanced Tactical II in the video embedded below.

    <title>Springfield Armory&#039;s XD-S 4.0, 9 mm Range Officer </title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=27401</link>

      <![CDATA[Always a popular stop for attendees of Media Day at the Range, the <a href="http://www.springfield-armory.com" target="_blank">Springfield Armory</a> booth was dedicated to showing off two of the company's most buzzworthy upcoming releases: the XD-S 4.0 and the 9 mm Range Officer.



The XD-S 4.0 delivers all of the same sought-after features of its predecessor-just with a 4-inch barrel. Born of a desire to give shooters a compact, easy-to-conceal .45, the original XD-S featured a slim, single-stack design that's only one-inch in width. Its trigger has a short travel and a short reset to keep you on target, and the snag free sights make it holster friendly. Now shooters have a slightly longer option. The XD-S is expected to be available beginning in February 2014.



The Range Officer, a 9 mm 1911 design, has the same quality forged national match frame and slide as the company's Trophy Match and TRP 1911s-and it gets the same precision fit as those pistols, too. Add in the same national match stainless steel barrel and bushing, and you've got a pistol that shoots well beyond its price tag.

      <![CDATA[It's safe to say that <a href="http://www.keltecweapons.com/our-guns/sub-2000/rifle/" target="_blank">Kel-Tec</a> is not a typical firearm manufacturer. Although it's a relatively small company in regard to its production volume, Kel-Tec has a catalog of products demonstrating innovative gun design and creative problem solving. For example, Kel-Tec recently garnered all kinds of attention with its unusual dual-magazine bullpup KSG shotgun. In 2001, it released an update to its blow-back operated folding pistol-caliber carbine, the SUB 9, and called it the SUB 2000. Available in 9 mm or .40 S&amp;W, this rifle is unlike anything else on the market-and did we mention that it can fold in half?



To learn more about the SUB-2000, check out the video embedded below.

      <![CDATA[Renowned rifle maker Mauser offers the Model 12 as part of its entry-level portfolio, in calibers ranging from .22/250 all the way up to .338 Win. Mag. A solid, all-steel construction, and newly developed 3-position horizontal safety system that acts directly on the firing pin contribute to the modern characteristics of this gun. But make no mistake, this is still a traditional long gun, which has a detachable box magazine with 5+1 capacity (4+1 for magnum calibers) and Rigby-style cheekpiece.



This rifle will be featured in the March 2014 issue of <em>American Rifleman</em>, but in the meantime, learn more about the gun and watch Mark Keefe send it downrange in this video.

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sigsauer.com/" target="_blank">SIG Sauer</a> held its own Media Day event and, in the process, rolled out a handgun that's bound to be one of SHOT Show 2014's most popular products: the P320.



Designed from the ground up with the input of law enforcement officers, the P320 is meant to be the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today.



Taking into account the concerns of military and police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to takedown the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance.



With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw.



The P320 will be immediately available in 9mm, .40S&amp;W and .357SIG, with .45ACP coming later in 2014.



To learn more about the P320, check out the video embedded below.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[There are many aspects of many pistols that I like. I LOVE shooting the GI issue 1911! But will not carry one for duty. Likewise, I don't like the ergonomics on Glocks, but would carry one any day. Sig falls about in the middle for me. The one thing I don't like is the slide release placement. My big hands, when I stack my thumbs, always seem to touch it juuuuust enough to keep it from locking back on an empty mag. Not so much a defect on Sigs as much as an aspect of the design which affects a lot of shooters, on the reload.<!--mobile-->]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[I am curious as to how Mark held his left support hand on this pistol.  I use the Jerry Barnhart grip, with my left index finger on the front of the trigger guard, but his grip with the support hand seems to be way forward.  He must have had a finger on the slide stop, causing it to ride over the follower, inducing the last round hold open malfunction.

Love the ergonomics of the SIG handguns, but have never purchased one due to my familiarity of 1911 controls.  ]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I have a Sig P250 sub-compact, bought the extended round clips. Tried Berettas, Glocks, HK, S&W, settled on the Sig S&W 40. Smooth shooting, very accurate, easy take down & assembly, comfortably concealable even with the extended capacity clips @ 13 rounds.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[This doesn't tell the whole story.  It's got the modularity of the Sig P250 in a striker fired pistol.  Two trigger style options, three grip module sizes, two barrel and slide lengths.  It costs more than a Glock, but you can buy extra parts and have two guns for less money.  Technically a convertable gun because the fire control module has the serial number.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[LOTS of stupid comments on here  not related to this pistol. 'I shoot this' and 'I shoot that'. Who friggin' cares? The demo was about the P320, not an inquiry as to your personal firearm preference. Also, I noted a lot of people blaming Sig for the last round mishap, but if you were really watching, I don't think this guy's grip actually cleared the slide release properly. And the Glock-tards left the DUMBEST comments by far: 'Glock rules'? At what? Being ugly, un-ergonomic, and completely mediocre? Anyone who shoots REAL GUNS knows Sig makes FAR SUPERIOR weapons to Glock, in every way, shape and form. Just a lot of old-world ignorance and close-minded blow-hards bagging no something they haven't even shot yet. It saddens me that gun culture is so heavily laden with these kinds of rubes. ]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I actually held  the full size 9 at my LGS Friday and I do like it. yes it feels like a p250 in your hand , but I liked the p250. Trigger is very smooth, has almost a 2 stage feel to it. And the reset is very quick. LGS price was $ 569 so is very similar in price to Glocks. If it shoots anywhere near as good as my 2022, I will have to buy one!]]></comment_content>

      <![CDATA[Not a lot in the industry surprises <em>American Rifleman</em> Editor-in-Chief Mark Keefe, but the announcement that <a href="http://www.sigsauer.com/" target="_blank">SIG Sauer</a> intended to launch its own ammunition line certainly did.



SIG is having the line made to its specifications, with its components. At its launch, the line will have offerings in 9 mm, .40, .45 and, of course, .357 SIG. It's expected to be on shelves later on in 2014.



To learn more about the upcoming ammunition line, check out the video embedded below.

    <title>Diamondback DB15 Pistol</title>

      <![CDATA[In 2009, <a href="http://diamondbackfirearms.com/" target="_blank">Diamondback Firearms LLC</a> arrived on the shooting scene with its polymer-framed pocket pistols. Then, the Florida-based company expanded its product line to include an all American-made AR-15 style rifle. For 2014, the company has cropped its ARs to produce a new line of DB15 pistols, with the initial offerings chambered for 5.56/.223 ammunition.



The DB15 pistol employs a traditional gas-impingement system. The mil-spec 8620 bolt carrier is shot-peened and subjected to a magnetic particle inspection (MPI). The 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel is 7.5-inches long with a 1 in 9 twist rate. The free-floated barrel is threaded to accept muzzle accessories and arrives with the exotic DB 5.56 Edge flash hider installed.



The upper and lower receivers are constructed of forged 7075 T6 aluminum, with the upper being of the A3 flat-top variety. The upper receiver's Picatinny rail is aligned with the full-length, milled-in top rail of the 6.25-inch long aluminum one-piece handguard. The handguard verges on being skeletonized due to its multiple weight-reducing vents. A second full-length rail is located on the bottom of the guard for mounting lights and lasers.



In place of the commonly used hard plastic A2 grip, Diamond back installed a <a href="http://www.magpul.com/" target="_blank">Magpul </a>MOE+ grip. This grip features a reinforced polymer body with wrap-around rubber overmolding. The gun arrives with another popular Magpul product, one of the polymer 30-round PMAG magazines.



The buffer tube, which is concealed inside the shoulder stock of a full-sized AR-15 rifle, protrudes from the receiver. The tube is partially covered with a soft foam slip cover. The DB15's controls are of the standard AR configuration. The magazine release, bolt release and charging handle are all standard AR-15 fare in the normal locations. The DB15 pistol provided for this review was the model DB15PFDE7, which has a flat (non-reflective) dark-earth Cerakote finish on the receiver and fore-end with matte-black controls and appointments. The pistol is also available in a black or OD green finish.



Since many AR-15 fans like to upgrade and modify their shooting platforms, a few legal points should be touched upon here. The DB15 is legally considered a handgun because it leaves the factory configured to meet the Federal Government's regulatory definitions of a handgun. In short, a gun is a handgun when it is designed to be fired with one hand.



Due to the <a href="https://www.atf.gov/firearms/nfa/index.html" target="_blank">National Firearms Act of 1934</a>, and the the <a href="http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/firearms-technology.html#vertical-fore-grip" target="_blank">Gun Control Act of 1968</a>, attaching certain accessories to a <a title="See more pistols with rifle-type actions. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/gallery.php?id=20260" target="_blank">rifle-action pistol</a> will change its status under the law. For example, attaching a shoulder stock to this pistol would convert it into a short-barreled rifle (SBR), which is a regulated item. Attaching a vertical grip to the handguard of this pistol will change it from a one-handed firearm into a two-handed firearm, or an Any-Other-Weapon (AOW), which is again a regulated item. If you are not sure how a particular modification may affect the legal status of a handgun, be sure to check the local and Federal regulations before making any changes.



The DB15 arrived without a sight system installed. To prepare the pistol for range testing, a <a href="http://www.hawkeoptics.com/" target="_blank">Hawke Sport Optics</a> XB 1x32 Multi-Purpose Reticule scope (HK3265) was attached to the sight rail using a set of low-mount rings provided with the scope. The XB, with its mono-tube design and fully floating, glass-etched multi-purpose reticule, is often used on shotguns for turkey hunting and AR platforms for close-quarters-combat applications. The shooter can use the scope with the illumination turned off, or with the reticule illuminated to five different levels of brightness in either green or red.



Finding a way to conveniently carry a rifle-action pistol like the DB15 to and from the range can be a challenge. Handgun cases are too small, while rifle cases are far too large. <a href="http://www.blackhawk.com/" target="_blank">BLACKHAWK!</a> provides a carrying solution with its Diversion Racquet Bag. Constructed of tough 420 velocity nylon with heavy-duty, lockable zipper pulls, the Diversion has an exterior designed with the shape and appearance of an ordinary tennis racquet cover, like those found in big-box and sporting good stores.



The interior of the case features padded walls that mask the firearm's outline and protect it from bumps and scratches. A removable internal divider allows the case to hold two handguns or the two halves of a separated AR-15 rifle. An external zippered pocket provides additional storage space. With the magazine removed, the scoped DB15 slipped comfortably into one side of the divided Diversion bag without any wasted space. This left the other side free for spare magazines, ammo and a portable cleaning kit.



At the shooting range, the DB15 proved to be well balanced and comfortable to shoot. As one might expect, it put on an impressive light and sound show. However, the felt recoil produced by the pistol ranged from moderate to mild. It has all of the thunder of a magnum revolver but without the pain. The fit and finish was top notch, with all of the components coated properly and all of the controls running smoothly. Like other handguns in its class, it would benefit from the installation of a single-point sling mount so that a sling could be used to provide increased stability when shooting off the bench.



The pistol was tested with a mix of ammunition ranging from steel-cased practice loads to premium brass-cased hollow points. The pistol did experience one failure to eject during the first 20-rounds fired, and that particular round had to be tapped out because it was tightly wedged into the chamber. Other than this one failure, the pistol ran without additional malfunctions using a variety of ammunition and magazines (polymer and aluminum). Therefore, it would seem that a faulty round, not the pistol, was the source of this singular event.



Formal accuracy testing consisted of five, five-shot groups fired at 25 yards from a benchrest. The DB15 yielded consistent group sizes that hovered right around 1.5 inches in size. The best single group of 1.38 inches was produced using <a href="http://federalpremium.com/" target="_blank">Federal</a> American Eagle 55-grain FMJ rounds. This load produced the best group average of 1.53 inches, followed by <a href="http://www.hornady.com/" target="_blank">Hornady</a> Superformance 55-grain GMX at 1.56 inches and <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester</a> USA 55-grain FMJ at 1.59 inches.



Diamondback has made a commitment to produce AR rifles and pistols made entirely in the United States using components machined in its CNC facility. The DB15 is a clean, contemporary rifle-action pistol that performed right out of the box. This semi-auto would be useful as a "trunk" gun, short-range hunting pistol or a bug-out piece. But best of all, it's just plain fun to shoot.

      <![CDATA[If you are in the market for a Kalashnikov-style semi-auto, be it a rifle or a pistol, then <a href="http://www.centuryarms.com/" target="_blank">Century International Arms</a> is likely to have what you're looking for. The company provides a wide variety of barrel lengths and stock types in both foreign and domestic models, based on the successful AK-47 action. A few years ago, the company introduced the all-American Centurion line of milled-receiver AKs, including the 16.25-inch barrel Centurion 39 Sporter rifle and the 11.37-inch barrel C39 pistol. For 2014, the company is launching a new variation on the pistol, called the C39 Micro.



To some shooters, the idea of building a <a title="See more rifle-action pistols. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/gallery.php?id=20260" target="_blank">handgun from a rifle design</a> may seem a bit odd but rifle-action pistols are more common than one might expect. Some have been developed as novelty or Hollywood movie guns because they look cool on screen, like the <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/henry-repeating-arms-mares-leg-22-review/" target="_blank">mare's leg lever-action pistols</a>. Others have been born of military expediency. Removing a rifle's stock and installing a shortened barrel results in a compact submachine gun that is fully compactable with the parts and ammunition on hand for combat long guns. Modern civilian-legal semi-auto versions of these military-rifle inspired handguns include the <a href="http://www.auto-ordnance.com/" target="_blank">Auto Ordnance</a> Thompson pistol, the <a href="http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/product/76215" target="_blank">I.O. Inc.</a> Polish PPS-43C Pistol, the <a href="http://diamondbackfirearms.com/category?cat=8" target="_blank">Diamondback</a> DB15 and of course the C39.



The C39 Micro is a pistol that makes a good first impression. Some AKs are fairly rough around the edges but this one is sturdy, clean and has a top-notch level of fit and finish inside and out. This semi-auto employs the classic AK-47 gas-piston system. Propellant gases are bled from the barrel to a piston attached to the bolt carrier. This gas pressure cycles the action, ejecting spent cases from the chamber and loading fresh rounds from the detachable box magazine.



The C39 Micro is, well, “micro” because of the short 6.25-inch barrel, which is fitted with a removable four-port flash hider. A small spring-loaded plunger holds the flash hider in place until it’s purposefully removed. The hooded front-sight post twists up and down for height adjustments. Pairing a traditional rear sight with the front sight posed a problem for the manufacturer because the shortened barrel leaves very little real-estate. Installing a rear sight would leave no place for a scope mount, whereas a traditional scope mount would leave no room for a rear sight.



Century's solution was to mount a 4.25-inch steel Picatinny sight rail to the rear sight block, which contains two 0.35-inch-long, red fiber-optic pipes. A sight picture is formed by aligning the two red dots with the post of the front sight. It's a clever solution that's sturdy, easy to use and allows an optic to be attached without modifications to the iron sights. The rail is held in place by two Phillips-head screws that will need a good dose of LocTite to keep them secured.



The receiver cover is of the standard, stamped sheet-metal variety. The wooden fore-end grip extends from the base of the flash hider to within a half-inch of the magazine well, wrapping around the receiver. The wide, curving shape of the fore-end serves several support-hand functions. First it provides a comfortable griping surface. However,the lip of the fore-end also helps to shield the support hand from muzzle blast and the added girth helps to keep fingers and thumbs away from the four hot gas ports located between the front sight and the rear sight rail.



At the heart of the C39 Micro is a milled 4140 ordnance-grade steel receiver. The receiver starts as an 11-pound billet that is reduced to just 1.5 pounds once the shaping processes are complete. It’s more expensive and time consuming to produce a milled receiver, instead of stamping it out of sheet steel, but the result is a much more durable component with tighter tolerances.



The external controls of the C39 Micro are shaped, located and operated in the typical AK fashion. The charging handle, ejection port and safety lever are located on the right side of the receiver. The safety lever swings down into the fire position and up into the safe position. The magazine release lever is mounted on the front of the square trigger guard. The trigger assembly is the smooth-cycling G2 model from <a href="http://www.tapco.com/" target="_blank">TAPCO</a>. This particular trigger broke cleanly at 3 pounds, 13 ounces. The finger-grooved black polymer pistol grip is checkered with thumb relief notches on both sides. The gun accepts most AK-style magazines and arrives with two polymer TAPCO magazines. One holds 10-rounds while the other is a 30-round model.



Rifle-action pistols can be plenty of fun to work with at the shooting range and the C39 Micro was no exception. Shooters in neighboring lanes stopped by to ask about the pistol because of its unusual size and the impressive light and sound show it produced. Like other rifle-action pistols, the C29 Micro is heavy. Unloaded, it weighs 5 pounds, 10 ounces. Inserting a loaded 10-round magazine adds about 10 ounces to the pistol's weight, while a fully filled 30-rounder adds around 1 pound, 9 ounces. The good news is that the extra weight, most of which is forward of the magazine well, keeps the C39's recoil to a moderate level.



But how does one go about aiming over 6-pounds worth of unwieldy pistol for accurate shot placement? The more common methods for steadying a gun like this one include using a benchrest, attaching a single-point sling or generating a push-pull tension between the shooting hand and the support hand when no other external supports are available. But Century International Arms is now providing an additional option in the form of the SB-47 Stabilizing Brace.



The brace was originally designed by Alex Bosco of <a href="http://sb-tactical.com/" target="_blank">SB Tactical</a> for injured veterans to help stabilize AR- and AK-based pistols for single-handed operation. The SB-47 secures the pistol to the forearm of the shooter via a rubber cuff fitted with two adjustable hook-and-loop straps. The brace attaches to AK-type pistols using a bracket that fits between the receiver and the pistol grip, with the brace positioned against the rear of the receiver.



Upon examining the brace for the first time, the following legal question came to mind: Will attaching this product (which looks a bit like a stumpy shoulder stock) to an AK pistol constitute a violation of <a href="http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/national-firearms-act-firearms.html" target="_blank">NFA regulations</a> regarding the conversion of pistols into short-barreled rifles? According to the copy of a BATFE approval letter provided with the brace, the answer is no. "We find that the device is not designed or intended to fire a weapon from the shoulder."



The SB-47 brace did a great job of adding stability to the pistol for off-the-bench shooting. Securing the cuff to the shooting-hand forearm distributes the weight across more muscle groups and greatly reduces the heavy pistol's tendency to twist, sway or drop down at the muzzle.  However, the brace adds almost a pound and a half of weight to the pistol, requires a modified shooting stance to use and takes some time to get used to. But it was certainly useful on the shooting range.



The pistol operated flawlessly with every type of ammunition it was fed, ranging from steel-cased full-metal-jacket rounds to brass-cased, soft-nose hunting loads. Formal accuracy testing was conducted from a benchrest by firing five, five-shot groups into targets at 25 yards using the pistol's factory-installed sights. The best single group of 1.91 inches was produced using <a href="http://www.hornady.com/" target="_blank">Hornady</a> 123-grain Z-MAX steel-cased ammunition, which also resulted in the best group average of 2.27 inches. <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester</a> Super X 123-grain soft-point brass-cased loads averaged 2.35 inches. Century recently started shipping 180-round Range Packs of its steel-cased, non-corrosive 123-grain full-metal-jacket <a href="http://www.centuryarms.biz/categories.asp?cat=122" target="_blank">Red Army Standard</a> 7.62x39 mm ammunition, which yielded a group average of 2.42 inches.



The Century International Arms C39 Micro is a sturdy, reliable rifle-action pistol that's one of the most compact factory-made AK-47 variants on the market. Shaving the barrel down to just over 6 inches reduces the pistol’s accuracy potential a bit. But with its unique sight system and smooth trigger, this 100-percent American-made semi-auto is certainly fun to shoot.

    <title>Yamaha Announces New Tactical Black Viking EPS 4x4</title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=27475</link>

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://yamahamotorsports.com/" target="_blank">Yamaha Motor Corp., U.S.A.</a>, has announced the introduction of the latest version of its new Viking EPE Side-by-Side (SxS) vehicle, the Special Edition (SE) Tactical Black Viking. Assembled in the U.S.A. and just announced, the new SE Viking combines an aggressive flat back painted appearance and popular accessories with classic Yamaha durability and off-road capabilities.



The new Tactical Black Viking EPS 4x4 boasts all of the category-leading features of Yamaha's standard Viking SxS, and also sports a molded sun top, overfenders, mud flaps, an under-seat storage box, bed-rail accessory mounts and exclusive black cast aluminum wheels.



The Yamaha Viking was first introduced last June when it set a new standard in the three-person multi-purpose SxS segment. Designed and engineered as a robust and high-capacity utility vehicle, the Viking combines Yamaha’s most powerful four-wheel drive engine to date with a comfortable and confidence-inspiring three-person cab, precision steering and class-leading handling. The vehicle’s distinctive features make it the most off-road capable vehicle in its class and the only one with true three-person seating capacity.



The vehicle's power comes from Yamaha’s strongest four-wheel drive engine to date-a 686cc liquid-cooled 4-stroke, SOHC, single-cylinder, 4-valve fuel-injected engine that provides peak performance at maximum capacity. This durable engine has been optimized for working conditions with strong low-end torque while quick throttle response and smooth power delivery are maintained throughout the rev range.



While the Viking’s 700cc-class engine makes more power than some larger 800cc-class machines, the vehicle’s handling and off-road capabilities truly set it apart. Yamaha’s three-way On-Command system, featuring 2WD, 4WD and 4WD with differential lock, is a driver-controlled system with an automotive-type rotary dial selector. This driver-controlled system gives the driver the control and confidence to lock in all four wheels based on the terrain-a significant benefit over other automated systems on competitive models.



The SE Tactical Black Viking 4x4 EPS will be available in the spring of 2014 with an MSRP of $13,749.

      <![CDATA[An unprecedented number of first-time gun owners have flooded the industry, and selecting the proper ammunition has been one of their greatest challenges. <a href="http://www.winchester.com" target="_blank">Winchester</a> has decided to make things a little easier on new shooters, with the introduction of its new W Train &amp; Defend brand.



Designed to provide threat stopping power with less recoil to the shooter, the system pairs its range-ready Train rounds with technology-driven Defend rounds, both designed to limit the recoil felt by the shooter. The new system provides an ideal solution for new shooters, as it helps train an operator to become proficient with their personal defense ammunition.



You can learn more about the upcoming line with the video embedded below.

    <title>Tac-Con 3MR Trigger System</title>

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.tacconusa.com" target="_blank">Tactical Fire Control, Inc.</a> (also called Tac-Con) was at SHOT Show 2014's Media Day at the Range, and brought along its new 3MR Trigger System. Designed to provide military, law enforcement and civilian shooters with performance features that have previously been unattainable from a non-NFA trigger system, the 3MR was a hot item, indeed.



The 3MR Trigger System is a drop-in, 3-mode fire control system consisting of Safe, match-grade Semi-Automatic, and the Tac-Con patented 3rd Mode of operation. The 3rd mode provides a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. Both semi and 3rd mode positions feature a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight with zero take-up and no overtravel.



Tac-Con is now accepting pre-orders for the 3MR at its website.



You can learn more about the 3MR Trigger System with the video embedded below.

      <![CDATA[Though Adcor Industries has long been in business as a national defense supplier, it's civilian side, <a href="http://www.adcordefense.com" target="_blank">Adcor Defense</a>, remains relatively new to the firearms industry. That hasn't prevented it from making quite the impact, though-namely with its Adcor A-556 Elite, which sports a revolutionary gas piston system as one of its multiple patents.



As you might expect, Adcor brought the rifle to SHOT Show 2014's Media Day at the Range. The company dialed things up a notch, though, by assemling a specialized training scenario and inviting Medal of Honor recipient Clinton Romesha to play instructor to any interested media members.



Get a closer look at the Adcor rifle and see <a href="http://www.shootingillustrated.com" target="_blank"><em>Shooting Illustrated's</em></a> Adam Heggenstaller in action on the course with the video embedded below.

      <![CDATA[In order to meet the demands of the growing 3-Gun market, <a href="http://www.winchester.com" target="_blank">Winchester</a> has developed custom loads, with a dual emphasis on speed and accuracy. Winchester’s Win3Gun is competition-grade ammunition, available in the calibers used in 3-Gun competition-9 mm, .40 S&amp;W, .45 ACP, 5.56 mm and 12 gauge.



All pistol cartridges (9 mm, 40 S&amp;W and 45 ACP) in the Win3Gun line use lead-free primers and heel-encapsulated bullets. This makes the pistol offerings incredibly clean firing, which in turn keeps the compensator ports of popular competition pistols clean and free of vaporized lead. The Win3Gun line also includes a center-fire rifle round in 5.56 mm with a 55-grain bullet and two 12-gauge shotgun loads with 7½ shot and 00 buckshot.



You can learn more about the new ammunition line in the video embedded below.

      <![CDATA[To expand its offerings for both personal defense and recreational shooting, TriStar Arms has introduced the P-120 Series in 9 mm.



Available in double/single action, the P-120 features a rear snag-free dovetail sight and fixed front blade sight. The new pistol also features a steel frame and slide, a bottom rail and black polymer checkered grip.



Until now, TriStar pistols have been available in both blued and chrome finish, but TriStar has now converted to a Cerokote finish on all pistol offerings. The Cerakote finish protects the firearm and makes it easier for gun owners to customize their guns.



The pistols, manufactured in a NATO-approved factory in Turkey, are mil-spec and put through a 50 thousand-round endurance test. They ship with two magazines, safety lock and cleaning kit. MSRP is $429 to $469.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I've got a tristar t-100 it fits great in the hand fires well the only complaint I have were the cheap plastic grips and when trying to replace them it's next to impossible to find a good fit. Contacted tri-star and was given advice to look for baby eagle grips and magazines for replacements however still have problems with the fit of the magazines and the grips.  We need specific parts designed for the t-100 guns and exactly where to get them so they will actually fit.  <!--mobile-->]]></comment_content>

    <title>Uberti 1873 Lever-Action Competition Rifle</title>

      <![CDATA[Lever-action aficionados: Rejoice! Uberti has figured out how to combine the Best of the West with the marvels of modern engineering in a new high-performance lever-action rifle. The 1873 lever-action competition rifle is a Winchester 1873 replica that incorporates several features that make it competition-ready right out of the box. For instance, an action job slicks up the trigger and shortens the lever's stroke for accurate and rapid-fire duties. A 20-inch octagonal barrel allows for greater maneuverability and yet provides the accuracy that is required in fast-action competition. A shotgun-style buttstock provides for quick shouldering and a gold front sight bead aids in quick-target acquisition.



The rifle is available in .357 Mag. and .45 Long Colt, and is finished with a color case-hardened receiver and a blued barrel stock. MSRP is $1499.

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.steyrarms.com/" target="_blank">Steyr's</a> AUG A3 is easily one of the most recognizable firearms in the industry-and, admittedly, the new M1 series doesn't look extraordinarily different. The perks it's going to deliver, however, are something to pay attention to.



The AUG A3 M1 series, which should be available later in 2014, will feature a rail system that can be integrated with an optic or adorned with any variety of picatinny rail-friendly accessories. A quick-release button is also being incorporated, along with a detachable sling swivel.



Multiple stock colors will be available, including black, green and tan.



Get a closer look at the latest addition to the Aug line with the video embedded below.

    <title>Beretta ARX100</title>

      <![CDATA[The Beretta ARX100 rifle is equipped with a cold hammer-forged barrel that can be removed and replaced with various lengths and calibers in a matter of seconds; two configurations are available, the 5.56 and .300 AAC Blackout. The gun sports a constant contact piston system, allowing it to easily feed and fire, even under the most unforgiving conditions. Its lightweight, technopolymer receiver allows for reliable operation, with little lubricant.



Better yet, the ARX100 is completely ambidextrous. All of the firearm's critical controls can be adapted to suit a left-handed shooter-and a selector near the rear of the gun allows the user to switch between left or right spent casing ejection configurations. For more information, check out the video below or go to <a href="http://www.berettausa.com" target="_blank">BerettaUSA.com</a>.

    <title>New from Otis Technology</title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=27556</link>

      <![CDATA[Designed at the request of the military, Otis Technology's Ripcord is intended for one-pass cleaning. While many of the Ripcord's competitors require a firearm to be in a down position, the Ripcord's 10-inch helix design can be fed through the barrel from any configuration, which is both ideal and essential for troops who need to complete the cleaning operation in a hurry in the field under hot-barrel conditions.



Another feature that makes the Ripcord ideal for field use is that the Nomex material can withstand temperatures up to 700 degrees, while competitors are made from nylon, where heat is the enemy. Need another reason to try the Ripcord? How about a $14.99 price point.



And if the the Ripcord weren't exciting enough, Otis Technology is also the winner of the <em>American Rifleman</em> 2014 <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=13067&amp;cat=3&amp;sub=12">Accessory of the Year Golden Bullseye Award for its B.O.N.E. Tool</a>, designed specifically to clean AR 5.56 rifles. This handy little tool fits in your pocket, and can clean the bolt face, bolt carrier assembly and firing assembly. Look for a 7.62 AR version later this year.



To learn more about the Ripcord and the B.O.N.E. tool, watch the video below, and go to <a href="http://www.otisgun.com/">Otis Technology</a>.

      <![CDATA[This full-size .38 Spl.-caliber is a new, and very unique, offering from Taurus. The 85 View is made from forged-aluminum alloy with a titanium cylinder and barrel with a stainless insert for the sleeve. When fully loaded, the revolver weighs about 15 ounces. But that’s not what makes this gun unique. This small pistol is called the View because on the sight plate Taurus created a polycarbonate that allows the user to see the internal workings of the gun, purely for aesthetic appeal. The slight curvature on the back helps it to sit tight on your body, making it ideal for concealed carry. It features an MSRP of $599. For more information, watch the video below, and visit <a href="http://www.taurususa.com" target="_blank">TaurusUSA.com</a>.

      <![CDATA[Are you a serious target shooter? Then you'll want to check out new releases from CZ-USA. In the company's lineup for 2014 are three new shotguns: the Sporter Standard Grade Adjustable Rib, Canvasback Gold and Lady Sterling. The Sporter Standard Grade Adjustable Rib was designed for shooters who switch between shooting trap and clays, providing the capability to adjust the point of impact to shoot high or flat.



The Canvasback Gold is a newer edition of the well-known Canvasback, but it now features two gold birds inlaid on each side, hence the name.



The Lady Sterling is a 12-gauge, 28-inch barrel shotgun made specifically for women, the characteristics of which are most obvious in the stock design. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.cz-usa.com" target="_blank">CZ-USA.com</a>.

      <![CDATA[For 40 years Eagle Grips has used rosewood, ebony wood, mother of pearl, even some ivory and simulated ivory. But now the company is using a new medium called Kirinite in a certain line of grips. Sound like something from where Superman came from? Perhaps not, but Kirinite is a very dense material that doesn't dull or scratch and is available in a plethora of colors. Paul Huble explains it further in the video below. For more information, visit <a href="http://EagleGrips.com" target="_blank">EagleGrips.com</a>.

    <title>Browning Expands 1911-22 Line</title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=27611</link>

      <![CDATA[Smaller incarnations of full-size guns aren’t necessarily a recent phenomenon-nor are full-size models that have been chambered in substantially smaller calibers. Rimfire versions of service revolvers and semi-automatics have always been popular for training and plinking purposes, and conversion kits have made it easy for target shooters to turn select models into .22 caliber pistols with relative ease. A few years ago, <a href="http://www.browning.com" target="_blank">Browning</a> took the concept to a different level, though, with the release of its miniaturized 1911-22.



The 1911-22 has been a success for Browning-so much so that the company has taken strides to significantly expand the line. A selection of new variants should hit the market at some point in 2014-including polymer framed versions and a model with a full-on accessory rail.



Learn more about the latest additions to the 1911-22 line by watching the video embedded below.

    <title>Colt Mustang XSP</title>

      <![CDATA[Much like the .380 Mustang PocketLite design that preceded it, <a href="http://www.coltmfg.com" target="_blank">Colt's</a> Mustang XSP is a small, lightweight and reliable handgun-except, this time, it's sporting a polymer frame.



Such a frame, of course, is the most noticeable difference between the two models-but it's not the only one. Colt spent a significant amount of time adding a series of ergonomic touches to the firearm's frame, improving its performance in the operator's hand.



Colt is continuing its standard tradition of offering a "First Edition" run of its new handguns. 1,000 First Edition models will be available.



Get a closer look at the Mustang XSP-notably, the aforementioned First Edition version-with the video embedded below.

    <content_encoded><![CDATA[Although many shooters choose to own semi-auto pistols, not all of them have the hand strength necessary to rack the slide. The <a href="http://www.handi-racker.com/">Handi-Racker</a> block is designed to make the loading and unloading of pistols easier to accomplish. With the block set on the top of the slide at the muzzle end of the gun, the user can press the block against a hard surface to provide the leverage needed to chamber a fresh round, or to unload the pistol. Best of all, the fingers of the hand holding the block do not cross in front of the pistol’s muzzle when the block is in use. This product is available in four different sizes to accommodate a wide variety of semi-autos, ranging from diminutive pocket pistols up to full-size .45s.]]></content_encoded>

      <![CDATA[In conjunction with Cooper Firearms of Montana, <a href="http://www.coltmfg.com" target="_blank">Colt</a> has expanded its M2012 bolt-action rifle line. Two new models-the M2012MT308T and M2012LT308G/M2012LT260G-follow their predecessor in the line, the M2012SA308.



All M2012 models feature a custom fluted, match grade barrel and a single stage, adjustable Timney trigger. A signed, serial numbered and dated test target is included with each rifle as a testament to its accuracy.



The M2012MT308T, offered in .308 Winchester, is designed with the shooter’s comfort in mind, making it ideal for long sessions at the range. It’s ruggedness and accuracy also make it a great choice for experienced hunters.



The second new addition to the M2012 family is available to the market in two calibers. The M2012LT308G is chambered in .308 Winchester and the M2012LT260G is chambered in .260 Remington. It is designed to help any hunter take their trophy buck with ease and hit the mark at the range.



See some of the new M2012 rifles for yourself by checking out the video embedded below.

      <![CDATA[Shooting Ruger 10/22 rimfire rifles with 25-round magazines is an enjoyable pastime, but reloading the magazines, one round at a time, is not. The rugged HC3R magazine from <a href="https://www.hcmags.com/">HCMAGS</a> can be quickly reloaded with ease using stripper clips that feed into the back of the magazine, loading 25 cartridges in a single motion. An on-board ammo pocket can hold an additional 20 rounds.



For 2014, the company is offering its new Tactical Pack. This rapid-reloading system includes one magazine, five stripper clips, and a speed loader box all conveniently tucked into a custom carry case with additional pockets for targets and tools. This kit stores and organizes up to 545-round of .22 LR ammunition, all ready for a trip to the range.]]>

      <![CDATA[Known for its high-quality custom guns and finishes, <a href="http://robarguns.com">Robar</a> introduces a new rifle designed for precision shooting. An accurized Remington 700 action and fluted match-grade barrel are mounted in a modular chassis system. The fixed shoulder stock has an adjustable check piece, a MIAD AR-15 style pistol grip is installed for versatility, and the free-floated forend accepts additional M1913 Picatinny rail mounts to complement the monolithic sight rail.



The standard trigger pull is just 2.5-pounds with other weights available. The chassis accepts AICS magazine, two of which are provided with the rifle. Customers will have the option of adding a Surefire flash hider, a muzzle brake, or to provide the muzzle accessory of their choice for installation. The SR21 will be made available in .308 Win, 300 Win Mag, and .338 Lapua.]]>

    <title>SIG Sauer 556xi</title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=27662</link>

      <![CDATA[<div>



<a href="http://www.sigsauer.com" target="_blank">SIG Sauer</a> had no shortage of new releases to roll out at its private media event at SHOT Show 2014, but few created as much buzz as the 556xi.



A continuation of the SIG 556 line-which itself was based on the legendary SG 550-the 556xi line is designed to change the way military, lawn enforcement and responsible citizens look at adaptable rifles. Utilizing the time-tested rotating bolt and adjustable gas piston operating system, the SIG556xi allows operators a choice of caliber, barrel length, handguard/stock configurations and lower receivers.



A removable barrel allows the operator to select the necessary length for a given mission. Adding the appropriate bolt, the SIG556xi can be changed to any of three calibers, 5.56x45 mm NATO, 300 Blackout, and 7.62x39 mm. Users can also quickly change out the non-serialized lower receiver, allowing the use of either AR-style STANAG magazines or rock-and-lock AK-style magazines.

    <content_encoded><![CDATA[Using a proprietary aluminum/magnesium alloy, <a href="http://www.magtacticalsystems.com/">MAG Tactical</a> provides AR-15 upper and lower receivers that are 35-percent lighter than MILSPEC aluminum models. These Gen-4 Ultralite components are a 6,000 series equivalent alloy, as compared to the 7075-T6 aircraft-grade aluminum typically in use, but it's strong enough for the job. The alloy is treated with a proprietary high-phosphorous nickel coating to give it added hardness, and then the components receive the customer's choice of finish and color. This year the company has released a complete rifle built with the Gen-4 receivers and a reduced-weight barrel. We've requested one for a full product review, so stay tuned!]]></content_encoded>

      <![CDATA[There is never a shortage of new AR-style rifles introduced at SHOT Show anymore, and Windham Weaponry has not disappointed with its latest entry. As it name indicates, the new .308 SRC (Sight Ready Carbine), which also accepts 7.62 x 51mm NATO, is ready for you to decorate with an optic of your choice. Practically bantamweight for an AR-platform rifle (only 7.5) pounds, this semi-automatic rifle features a gas-impingement system, has a 20+1 capacity and ships with one 20-round Magpul PMag magazine. The SRC has a flattop upper ready for accessories. Take a look at the rifle in the video below, and for more information, visit <a href="http://www.windhamweaponry.com/pdf/NewTechSeets/308-12-11-13-MSRP.pdf" target="_blank">WindhamWeaponry.com</a>.

      <![CDATA[Years ago, I wrote a couple of guidebooks on fishing in Arizona. You’re probably scratching your head about now, but some of the state’s lakes and rivers are on the desert floor, while others are high-mountain destinations at 9,000 feet. That means weather never closes the “season,” if you’re an avid angler smart enough to change destinations.



I visited many different waterways while researching the books, but one thing was always the same-a Plano tackle box was at my side. It doesn’t look new any more, but 20 years later, it still works perfectly, cleans easily and remains reliably simple. I don’t expect anything less from the company’s new line of shooting cases.



The Field Locker Mil-Spec Case series was unveiled yesterday morning at the Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade Show. There are five versions, varying in size from 56.38x18 x17.5 inches (with wheels) to a petite 17.876x10.920x6.882 inches (to protect a handgun), with each created using Plano’s innovative molding process that creates a reinforced shell. All are waterproof and dustproof and have a pressure-release valve. This is serious gear from a name outdoorsmen have grown to trust. MSRPs range from $94.99 to $249.99.



The introduction caught some by surprise, but Plano has been involved in the firearm market for a while. For the past year, my ARs have ridden to the range in the company’s <a href="http://www.planomolding.com/product.php?BCCID=120&amp;PID=844" target="_blank">Soft Sided Tactical AR 15 Case</a>. It’s not fancy, but it performs with that renowned Plano grace.



There aren’t many details on the website, but there’s a lot to like about this case. For example, it comes with a detachable, padded shoulder strap (1.5-inch-wide nylon) that frees your hands for ammo, chronographs or lunch. The attachment points on the case are anchored extremely well and the fasteners are metal, not polymer. So far this one hasn’t shown any signs of wear.



If you prefer to hand carry, nylon-webbing handles (1.5 inches wide) on both sides of the case can affix to one another with a hook-and-loop system to reduce palm strain if your bench is football fields away. The material used for the handles feels like it’s hollow and tubular, although a seam below the entire length leads me to believe it’s really doubled over and stitched. Either way, it’s much more comfortable with a heavy rifle than the flat nylon often found on other rifle cases.



The handles attach at the top of the case, but their nylon continues along the side (with stitching) until they meet a stippled and textured polymer coating that covers the bottom 2 inches of the bag. That’s where the bag will wear most as you drag it across the ground, drop it at the bench, or slide it out of the back of your pickup. The extra protection helps ensure longevity, and in true Plano style it doesn’t get much play on the website. The same “armoring” is found fore and aft on the bag.



Interior padding is generous and I’ve yet to knock optics off zero. There’s a faux quilting in the interior nylon, perhaps a touch to minimize the chance of tears spreading rapidly. I haven’t had any problems, that’s for sure.



The rifle case measures 42.5 inches long, 3.5 inches thick and 13.5 tall, so it holds most ARs.



I do have, however, two complaints. The label that reads, “Made in China” is on the exterior. Ignoring the debate in regard to overseas products, let me just say it’s dumb to have a white-and-gaudy label protruding from a pretty cool, tactical-looking rifle case. Luckily, and unlike mattress labels, it doesn’t indicate I’ll go to jail if I remove it, so it’s gone.



My other nitpicky concern has to do with details on the website. A zippered, side-storage compartment (that measures 17.25x9.5 inches) holds five magazines securely in pockets with hook-and-loop closures. That’s magazines, not the website’s claim of “clips.”



No, it’s not as sexy as the rest of our <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blog_list.php?cat_id=12463" target="_blank">SHOT Show coverage</a>, but it is interesting to note the number of well-known companies that have seen the light and are now producing serious firearms-related gear-even if they don’t get all the terms correct.]]>

      <![CDATA[It's one of those products that Cannon Security Products' competitors are probably asking: Why didn't we think of that? The new TV Mount Wall Safe is a security solution that might even prevent a would-be thief from wanting to steal your flat-screen. While it weighs a hefty 22 pounds, that's probably a good thing in this case, as its arm can hold up to an 80-pound or 65-inch TV. Other features include an electronic lock, two override keys, upholstered interior walls, steel construction, a false-bottom secret compartment and two LED interior lights. MSRP is $399.99.

      <![CDATA[Thanks to <a href="http://www.crimsontrace.com" target="_blank">Crimson Trace</a>, green lasergrips will hit the market for the first time in 2014-and the first two models were crafted with 1911-enthusiasts in mind. Much like the company's popular red lasergrips, the green models (LG-401G and LG-404G) are durable, easy to install and simple to create.



The lasergrips will feature Crimson Trace's patented Instinctive Activation. The LG-401G is designed to deliver top-of-the-class engineering, and will be one of the smallest gren lasers available on the market. The LG-404G, meanwhile, is designed for compact 1911 models. It also features Instinctive Activation.



More green lasergrips-namely those designed with popular Glock and Smith &amp; Wesson models in mind-are on the way.



Learn more about the green lasergrips with the video embedded below.

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.crimsontrace.com" target="_blank">Crimson Trace's</a> Rail Master laser sighting systems and tactical lights have become immensely popular throughout the industry, and for good reason. The company's latest release takes things to the next level by bringing those laser sighting systems and tactical lights together on one rugged, easy-to-operate platform: the Rail Master Pro.



The Rail Master Pro's options include: light and laser, laser only, light only and strobing light paired with the laser. Rail Master Pros are waterproof to 1 meter and have an impact resistant CNC machined solid aluminum housing. The battery life for this high-powered system is 4 hours and the unit automatically shuts-off after five minutes of non-use.



Utilizing Crimson Trace's Secure Lock Technology, the Rail Master Pros attach to a gun's rail system-and won't let go. In varying temperatures, and with repeated pounding recoil, the compact Rail Master Pro is the go-to unit for versatility and Crimson Trace quality.



Get a closer look at the Rail Master Pro with the video embedded below.

      <![CDATA[One of SHOT Show 2014's hottest new products, the <a href="http://www.remington.com" target="_blank">Remington</a> R51 is Big Green's official entry into the subcompact concealed carry market.



The Model R51 is a combination of features chosen specifically to make it extremely easy to point and shoot. Its grip angle has been optimized for rapid target acquisition. The low bore axis design boosts this effect while also aids in offering up to 25 percent less muzzle rise at the shot for faster, more accurate follow-ups. For comfortable carry, it features a lightweight aluminum frame with rounded edges.



The Model R51 subcompact is chambered in 9mm Luger +P, and will ship with an MSRP of $420. A variant featuring a <a href="http://www.crimsontrace.com" target="_blank">Crimson Trace</a> Laser Guard will be available for $609.



Get a closer look at the R51 with the video embedded below.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Ok everybody, let's sit back a bit and let the many make use if this fine pistol. While we observ if any recalls like the other fine manufacturers sent out due to design and parts failure. There will be more put out there for sale of course. The more the the consumers demands this the more the manufacturer would choke the availability! Which in turn jacks up the price by many increments through a short time.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I see a lot of caliber wars going on here.  Why the 9mm instead of the .40, you ask?  1[)] Cheaper ammunition, 2[)] Less pressure so your handgun will last longer, 3[)] Less recoil / more controllable / better accuracy, 4[)] NATO round, 5[)] It has been around longer than anyone that is posting on this site.  I get so tired of the whole caliber war.  If you want a .40 than have it.  Most don't want anything to do with it.  With today's technology, it is less about caliber and more about ballistics.  Today's ammunition is more advanced, more powerful and preforms better than ever imagined.  If I need anything bigger than a 9mm, I'll grab my 45.  However, let us not forget a handgun is nothing more than a weapon to fight your way to a better weapon...AKA: A shotgun or rifle. ]]></comment_content>

      <![CDATA[The new Weatherby Mark V ultra-lightweight RC rifle comes with a SUB-MOA guarantee, which is a three-shot group of .99-inch or less, as well as a factory-shot target signed by company President Ed Weatherby. The gun features a stainless steel blackened barrel that’s fluted to reduce weight, and full-length aluminum bedding block in the stock. The gun weighs about 5 3/4 pounds (standard action) and 6 3/4 pounds (magnum action), making it an ideal rifle to carry up into the mountains for long-range shooting. The rifle retails from $2,400 to $2,600, depending on options. Get a look at the rifle in the video below, and for more information, visit <a href="http://Weatherby.com" target="_blank">Weatherby.com</a>.

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sigsauer.com/" target="_blank">SIG Sauer's</a> single-action P938 9 mm has seen plenty of success since its introduction, and now SIG is offering its fans a chance to own that very same platform, but in .22LR.



The P938-22 Rosewood offers all the features of its larger-caliber brothers, but chambered in the common .22LR cartridge. With a 10-round magazine, the Rosewood features SIGLITE night sights, rosewood grips and a durable Nitron finish.



Owners of the standard P938, meanwhile, will be able to purchase one of two conversion uppers. The conversion kit contains a Nitron finished slide, 3.3" rimfire barrel and 10-round magazine. A 4.1" "long-slide" conversion features adjustable contrast sights and an increased sight radius.



Get a closer look at the P938-22 in the video embedded below.

        <![CDATA[Oh ya, yet another plastic compact...no...just kidding. Seems like a nice setup I especially like the 4 inch target slide. If I understand correctly you can have one frame but a 9x19, a 22LR and a 22LR target slides. I would love to see this in 22 Rem Mag instead, I don't know there could be design limitations though. But 8 to 10 shots of FTX 22 mags in this would be awesome. 

I can imagine the recoil on that with the 9x19 must be a hand full. ]]>

      <![CDATA[Thanks to a chemical change that hardens the steel on the gun, the Accura MR Nitride muzzleloader allows hunters to keep their firearms out in harsh weather without worrying about rust. The coating is applied to the inside of the barrel as well, providing the protection needed when the gun can't be immediately cleaned, such as while on a lengthy hunt. Any rust that might develop can be wiped away with an oil rag. The best news is that the Nitride finish is available on all Accura muzzleloaders for a nominal price increase. Check out the gun in the video below, and for more information, visit <a href="http://CVA.com" target="_blank">CVA.com</a>.

      <![CDATA[Les Baer loves his 1911s, and apparently his personal classic car collection just as much. Who certainly don't fault him for that, but how we do know this? Well, the Les Baer 1911 Hemi 572 was designed after one of Baer's muscle cars, a 1970 Plymouth Pro Street Hemi Cuda, a hallmark symbol of speed and power during the cars' 1960s and 70s heyday. And this gun reflects many of the same characteristics reminiscent of the era gone by: chrome-plated, a match-grade barrel and, of course, a precision fit. Other features include a double-serrated slide, Baer fiber-optic front sight with green insert, Hex head grip screws, VZ black recon grips, chrome finish on all major components and Dupont S coating on slide stop. It also includes an ambidextrous safety, mag catch and mag catch lock. To see this gun, watch the video below, and visit <a href="http://www.lesbaer.com/Hemi572.html" target="_blank">LesBaer.com</a>.

      <![CDATA[The new Buckmaster Squirrel Terminator is one of the latest additions to the Gamo product family. This air rifle features a fluted, polymer jacketed, precision rifled steel barrel. With .177 cal the Terminator shoots 1,275 fps. Also introduced was the Gamo Recon Whisper G2 line. The synthetic-stock ambidextrous Recon Whisper G2 includes a barrel identical to the Terminator, but is intended for youth shooters. It also includes a 2-stage adjustable trigger.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[This safe lacks just one thing: a way to secure it to some large piece of furniture or the wall. Perhaps it exists and the promo video didn't mention it. That way it could be a small bedside safe that you could leave at home with confidence. I was pleased to see that it has a manual override unlocking device. In the event of a solar EMP, we don't know what electronic devices will or will not work. AFIK we won't have an inkling about a solar EMP, just fat, dumb and happy until it happens and then widespread disaster.]]></comment_content>

    <title>Mossberg 500 JIC Patriot Shotgun</title>

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.mossberg.com" target="_blank">Mossberg</a> originally released its bug-out bag worthy 500 JIC (Just In Case) Series in 2008. For 2014, the company is taking things a step further with a commemorative edition meant to honor the 2nd Amendment and support the NRA: the 500 JIC Patriot 6-Shot.



Based on the 500 Cruiser 12-gauge platform, the JIC is a compact, self-contained and transportable 500 shotgun that comes conveniently packaged in a water-resistant tube, ideal for camping, boating and general readiness. The special 2nd Amendment Edition comes in a carrying tube that features the U.S. flag in full color, with the 2nd Amendment boldly emblazoned across the stripes of the flag.



The firearms' receiver, meanwhile, proudly wears the classic NRA logo on the port side. With each purchase, Mossberg will donate a portion of the proceeds to NRA programs, with a guaranteed minimum contribution.



To get a closer look at the JIC Patriot, check out the video embedded below.

      <![CDATA[Here's a one-of-a-kind piece of firearms artwork from <a href="http://cabotgun.com" target="_blank">Cabot Guns</a>, a true folded steel Damascus 1911. Most slides that are said to be Damascus are actually formed using a powdered alloy material. This slide was milled from a 50-layer block of American artisan made stainless steel by master Damascus craftsman Chad Nichols.



The grips for this pistol were provided by sculptor and artist Brian Challis, who shaped the panels from the tooth of an ancient wooly mammoth. It's a truly unique pistol that may not ever be replicated.

      <![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">



Not every work or living space is ideally suited for a full-size safe. In some cases, it would be helpful to have a safe that is not only compact, but able to hide in plain sight. For these situations, <a href="http://www.fortresssafe.com" target="_blank">Heritage Security Products</a> offers the Fortress brand R300E Diversion security safe. Weighing in at 190-pounds with 1/4-inch thick walls, the exterior of this product is designed to mimic the appearance of a mini refrigerator unit.



The hinged exterior door completely conceals the safe's quick-access electronic lock. The interior door is secured by 1-inch bolts, and the safe features the Alarm-U programmable alarm system for added security. Although this safe is not designed to hold long guns, the removable shelves and lockable pull-out drawer provide plenty of room for handguns, cameras, hard drives and other small valuables.

      <![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.bobergarms.com" target="_blank">Boberg Arms</a> semi-autos are among the most compact pocket pistols available for the calibers they fire. This year the company will be adding their first .45 ACP model, the XR45-S, which is rated for +P ammunition.



One of the features that make the Boberg so interesting is the reverse-feed magazine that strips cartridges backwards out of the magazine, instead of the usual method of the slide pushing them forward into the chamber. As a result, a longer barrel can be used in a short slide. Other features include a 3.75-inch rotating locked-breech barrel, a stainless steel slide, and a light-weight T6 aircraft-grade aluminum frame.

      <![CDATA[Keeping track of the status of a firearm's chamber, whether is open and empty or closed and loaded, can be a challenge when out in the field, participating in shooting competitions, or when enjoying a day at the range. The <a href="http://www.chamber-view.com" target="_blank">Chamber-View</a> line of empty chamber indicators (ECI) provide a quick, non-verbal means of determining if a firearm is in a safe condition.



Each rugged 100 percent silicon device is brightly colored and has a handle that protrudes from the chamber so as to be visible at a distance. The Chamber-View is currently available for shotguns, AR-15-style rifles, and semi-auto pistols chambered in 9mm and .40 S&amp;W, with additional models on the way.

        <![CDATA[Another product invented for a market that should not exist......

If everybody treated every weapon as if it were loaded and cocked then why do you need an empty chamber indicator?

  If everyone who touches a firearm never points it into a direction where it could hurt anybody or anything....then why do you need this? 

If everyone who handles a firearm never touches the trigger until he/she is ready to fire and destroy something......then why is this device necessary?

The best safety device on a firearm is the person who touches it. Period.]]>

        <![CDATA[Duffer--

One of my favorite gun stores [(]Clark Brothers, in Warrenton, VA[)] has a well-maintained and very well run public range in back of the store.  Periodically the range officer calls a cease-fire for shooters to walk downrange to post targets. During these periods, all guns must be unloaded with the actions open and any handling of guns is strictly prohibited.  Devices like chamber-view make it easier for the range officer and shooters alike to verify that the guns on the range points are in a safe condition when people are downrange.

Even the most careful people sometimes make mistakes.  That's why redundant safety measures are a good thing.]]>

    <content_encoded><![CDATA[Not long after <a href="http://www.stiguns.com">STI International</a> released the 6-inch barrel double-stack 2011 Perfect 10 pistol chambered in 10 mm, customers requested a single-stack version with a 5-inch barrel. This year, STI fans will get their wish with the new Nitro 10 pistol. Built using STI's 1911 Government forged steel frame, this 10mm has a classic, round-top slide with wide front and rear slide serrations. The 5.01-inch bull barrel is ramped for improved feeding and has a fully supported chamber. Available in a blued finish with the flats of the slide polished, this 10 mm will come in handy for target practice at the range, tactical shooting, or hunting big game.]]></content_encoded>

    <content_encoded><![CDATA[This new dual pouch, in-the-waistband holster system from <a href="http://www.tuffproducts.com">Tuff Products</a> allows small defensive pistols to hide in plain sight. The external pouch is designed to hold a wide variety of smart phones and is held firmly in place by a spring-steel belt clip. The in-the-waistband pouch tucks down below the belt line to fully conceal a small pistol. Lifting the holster's cover flap provides easy access to a phone. A smart, upwards tug on the cover flap quickly lifts and reveals the grip of the pistol when the gun needs to be drawn. The I-Tuck will be available in two models, for pocket-sized semi autos or J-Frame revolvers, in black or coyote tan, with additional color options on the way.]]></content_encoded>

    <title>Smith &amp; Wesson VTACII</title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=27851</link>

      <![CDATA[At least 20 wild hogs popped out of the west Texas mesquite and began trotting across a field some 80 to 90 yards to my right. A grey sow led the way, followed by a line of smaller hogs (not more than a few months old) and a couple medium-sized pigs. Bringing up the rear was a dark boar with a stout, triangular head and blocky shoulders. The way he took his time, you just knew: This big guy didn’t rush anywhere, for anyone.



I swung my <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CustomContentDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=750001&amp;catalogId=750051&amp;content=11001" target="_blank">Smith &amp; Wesson</a> VTACII rifle along the rail of my tripod stand, lined up the crosshairs of my scope on the mid-shoulder area, and squeezed off a shot. I followed with a fast follow up, even as the slab-sided hog jerked in the scope and began to sprint.



I fired twice more as he ran, both misses, as the hog was moving too fast and my heart suddenly beating too hard. He crossed behind a couple of trees, clearing them, his legs churning. As I tried to line up my scope on him, the boar hit the ground, tried to rise up, fell back and died.



At 90 yards with a broadside shot, any decent AR-style rifle could’ve made that first shot. But I also received some big assists with my successful second shot from this Smith &amp; Wesson rifle. Assist One: Unlike a lot of AR’s on the market, the VTACII employs a mid-length gas system, meaning the VTACII’s gas tube is approximately 2 inches longer than the tube on a standard AR carbine system. That longer gas tube helps lessen the felt recoil by reducing the bolt carrier velocity. Less recoil equals faster follow-up shots.



Reason Two: The <a href="http://geissele.com/" target="_blank">Geissele</a> Super V Trigger that comes standard on the VTACII, a single-stage trigger with a 4- to 4.5-pound pull weight, is just about the smoothest AR trigger I have ever used.



Sitting 15 feet up in a tripod stand, my first bullet took the boar mid-shoulder and plunged down and through his heart-lung area. The next bullet hit him about 6 inches further back, not a kill shot but a solid follow up to help anchor him, a 310-pound west Texas boar.



I spent a good part of the summer in the field and on the range with the VTACII, and it is accurate, easy and fun to shoot, and light and nifty afield. It’s great for shooting, even better for hunting.



While I don’t do 3-Gun competitions, the rifle clearly has that 3-Gun look to it, especially with the 13-inch long VTAC/<a href="https://troyind.com/" target="_blank">Troy</a> Extreme TRX Handguard that allows for quick target transitions. The new handguard also helps to reduce heat transfer, while the multiple accessory slots provide many options for mounting accessories.



The rifle’s 16-inch barrel is constructed of 4150 CMV steel, has a 1:8-inch twist rate, and a Melonite finish. The rifle features 5R rifling, with five rifling grooves designed with more angular lands than most rifling. The 5R approach is designed to reduce bullet jacket deformation versus common sharper-edged lands, to reduce powder fouling at the corner of the grooves to maintain better accuracy and reduce copper fouling and cleaning times.



The barrel’s tipped with S&amp;W’s patent-pending “Enhanced Flash Hider,” designed to significantly reduce flash signature and to direct gases and sound forward and away from the shooter.



The rifle also has a <a href="http://www.vltor.com/" target="_blank">VLTOR</a> IMod 6-Position, collapsible stock. It provides an excellent cheek weld that puts the face right at the correct eye level for the scope. A standard Picatinny rail runs along the top of the receiver and the handguard. Gas key and bolt carrier are chromed.



It also comes with a VTAC light mount, which fits most lights with a .80- to 1-inch diameter, and two, 2-inch adjustable Picatinny-style rails that can be mounted in the slots along the handguard. Rounding out the package are a VTAC Wide, Padded 2-Point Tactical Sling, a LPSM Low Profile Sling Mount and a 30-Round PMAG magazine.

Why so many “V’s” in the names and descriptors? Because the rifle’s the result of a collaboration between Smith and Wesson and U.S. Army Sgt. Maj. Kyle Lamb (retired), a veteran of Army special operations and owner of <a href="http://www.vikingtactics.com/" target="_blank">Viking Tactics</a>. A highly sought after tactical trainer, Lamb’s also the driving force behind Viking’s tactical products and accessories, many of which adorn the VTACII.



I fitted the rifle with a <a href="http://www.leupold.com/" target="_blank">Leupold</a> Mark AR Mod1 3-9x40 mm scope, attaching it with Leupold’s Mark 2 Integral Mounting System. I used this scope and rifle combo for all my range sessions and hunting time afield.



One problem I have when trying out new AR’s is that I tend to pull off too many shots, too fast. That makes a barrel heat up pretty fast (though the Troy Handguard worked as advertised and kept my hand cool), and accuracy definitely starts to waver from a very hot barrel. So while I started with four- and five-shot groups for accuracy testing at 100 yards, I ended up relying on three-shot groups and trying to let the VTACII cool down a bit between ammunition switches. Three shots, I felt, presented a better and fairer test for both the rifle and the ammunition.



I tried out four different brands of .223 ammunition for accuracy testing. The best three-shot group was from <a href="http://www.hornady.com/" target="_blank">Hornady’s</a> Superformace Match shooting a 75-grain BTHP bullet.  That ammunition consistently placed my groupings at 1 MOA or better, with the best three-shot string coming in at .780 of an inch.



Other .223 ammunition used, and their best groupings include: <a href="http://store.chencustom.com/" target="_blank">ASYM Precision</a> with 70-grain SDX bullet, 1.25 inches; <a href="http://drtammo.com/" target="_blank">Dynamic Research Technologies</a> 79-grain hollow-point bullets, 1.40 inches; and <a href="http://remington.com/" target="_blank">Remington</a> Premier Match 62-grain hollow point, 1.55 inches.



I killed the boar with Remington’s new Hog Hammer .223 ammunition, which propels a 62-grain Barnes TSX bullet out of the muzzle at 3,100 fps. Some Hog Hammer arrived just before I headed out for my hog hunt, so I was able to quickly reset my scope’s zero with this new ammo-it had been sighted in with the Remington Premier Match- but I never formally tested accuracy with it.



I also didn’t use any ammunition with bullets under 62 grains. I do a good deal of hunting with AR’s in .223. So I tend to use and practice with .223 ammunition featuring the heavier, longer bullets that are better able to bring down medium- to larger-sized game animals.



Actually, my first experience with the VTACII occurred in July 2012, on a Wyoming prairie dog shoot. For ammunition, I shot Hornady 55-grain Zombie Max with green tips. The rifle/Z-Max combo was dead on all day long, with never a jam or misfire in 400-plus rounds.



In my more recent time with the VTACII, I put another 200 rounds through it. So, all in all, 600-plus rounds were fired through two different VTACII’s without a single jam, despite some very dusty conditions and switching between various ammo brands.



The only real problem with the VTACII is a suggested retail price of nearly $2,000. Yet, I know two people who’ve actually paid $400 less for their VTACII’s in a store. If you take a $900 AR and refit it with a new trigger, better handguards and stock, plus a tactical sling and light mount, you are looking at $1500 and maybe a bit more. With the VTACII, you are all ready to go.

      <![CDATA[The first decade of the 20th century saw a lot of developmental effort in the handgun field. It’s well known that legendary designer John Browning was involved in both American and European firearms design. In 1910, he had all but completed-with <a href="http://www.colt.com/" target="_blank">Colt</a> and Army Ordnance-the development of the Government Model .45 pistol. Mr. Browning was also working with <a href="http://www.fnhusa.com/" target="_blank">FN</a>, the national arms plant of Belgium, and had used essentially the same design as the Colt. There were several different Colt pistols that had an FN counterpart. This was done with the approval of all concerned, because the two companies agreed not to sell arms in the others territories. They had literally divvied up the world and everything was working fine.



But they had omitted a few countries, which were open to competition. Romania, down in the Balkans, was such a place. Colt got wind of a Romanian interest in some kind of medium-bore auto. They developed and produced a scaled-down version of the soon-to-be famous 1911 pistol.  In so doing, they created a collector’s item, the 9.8 mm Colt. Only a few were made, because Colt salesmen were unable to sell the Romanian buyers on the gun.



Aware that this was going on, FN came up with a version of the same pistol. Once again, they were unable to sell anyone on the idea and the guns never went beyond the production prototype stage. They used a cartridge called the 9.65 mm Browning. All of this was well recorded in several respected sources. I once saw one of the Colt pistols at an NRA Convention, but was not allowed to handle it. I have never seen the FN gun or the ammo for it. The whole concept is very interesting to me, but the ammunition is even more so. If Colt and FN made essentially the same gun, why did they use two different cartridges?



It looks like they didn’t. The 9.8 mm Colt and 9.65 mm Browning are (nominally) .15 mm different in size. In English measurement, that is about .0059-fifty-nine ten thousandths-of an inch. That really is not much. As a matter of fact, it’s just about the difference between bore diameter and groove diameter. I would bet serious money that this was the difference between the 9.8 mm Colt and the 9.65 Browning. One company named its round on bore diameter, the other on groove. There is no real difference.]]>

      <![CDATA[This week, a large part of the east coast was hit with a pretty strong snow storm that caused some power outages and hazardous driving conditions, canceling school and work for many. Part way through the storm on Tuesday, I headed out to clear my car and driveway of snow, and, once again, had one of those thoughts that plague survivalists like me. I was the only one in my neighborhood who was clearing the snow, which meant I was the only one preparing for an emergency.



I like to have my vehicle ready to go in case I have to head out into the weather, be it for something as simple as gallon of milk or as important as rushing a child with a fever to the doctor. Every time there is a snow storm, I clear my area every few hours to ensure a fast exit time if needed, and I just can’t believe how few people seem to consider this as important.



Now I know that this isn’t a typical self-defense topic, but being prepared for any emergency is something I consider to be family defense. Being prepared is more than having a shotgun in the corner, a handgun on the hip and a first-aid kit in glove box. It’s a lifestyle that never ends, even when you’re stuck inside playing "snow monster eats the kids."]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Shoveling your driveway is always a desirable trait but once your car hits the end of your now-clean driveway and enters the deep snow of the unplowed road you're screwed. Depending on how high your level of problem-solving is, consider a 4X4 high-clearance SUV with serious tires. You will need the two-speed transfer case for busting through snow drifts in low range. Two sets of V-Bar chains would really come in handy. But if the situation is hopeless because you bottom-out, you'll have to crank up the snowmobile. You do have one in the garage don't you? Out here in the West we are used to snow and know how to get around in it. Stuck? Mandatory equipment includes a shovel and a tow strap for a pull from the other guy's unstuck vehicle. Stuck out in the boonies with no help? First you will freeze to death so have fire-starting materials, warm clothes, boots, and a sleeping bag. Next you will die of thirst but since there's plenty of snow around not a problem if you remembered to pack a stove and fuel. And finally, you will die of starvation so a quantity of high-energy food would be nice. Throw in some toilet paper and required meds and you're good-to-go.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Here in SoCal, deep snow is not so much of a problem, but remembering back to my misspent youth, I would just get the driveway cleared and the snowplow would come along and dump several feet of compacted snow at the end of the driveway. I think BigFoot's advice is well taken. I had never heard of being high-bottomed until my brother related how he got in that condition with his 4x4 F150 and had to be rescued by someone driving an even bigger truck.]]></comment_content>

      <![CDATA[Bushnell Outdoors has introduced the Rubicon line of flashlights, lanterns and headlamps, with optical technology from Bushnell to deliver brighter light and more efficient power.



With its Rubicon line, Bushnell Outdoors has addressed the problems with many outdoor lighting products, such as glare, low light and incorrect color temperatures.



Each Rubicon product is outfitted with high-quality, energy-efficient Cree LEDs for maximum brightness and extended battery life. By pairing the optics expertise of <a href="http://bushnell.com/" target="_blank">Bushnell</a> with LEDs, these lights produce light beams that are brighter and clearer, nine of which operate on AA or D cell batteries.



Constructed of aircraft-grade aluminum, the Rubicon flashlight series includes six models in a variety of sizes and light intensities. Each Flashlight is American National Standards Institute certified and incorporates the Total Internal Reflective optic, with outputs ranging from 100 to 1,000 lumens and offering several illumination settings.



Available in February 2014, the six flashlights have suggested retail prices ranging from $29.99 to $99.99, while the headlamps retail for $29.99 or $49.99 and the two lanterns for $29.99 and $49.99.]]>

      <![CDATA[The sound of breaking glass in the early hours of the morning woke the resident of a rural home and alerted him to a burglary in progress. The resident armed himself with a pistol and confronted the intruder, who was brandishing a hatchet. After a physical confrontation, the resident fired his pistol. The resident immediately called the police, who arrived to find the suspect in the home, deceased from a single gun-shot wound to the chest. (<a href="http://www.southbendtribune.com/" target="_blank"><em>South Bend Tribune</em></a>, Hudson Lake, IN, 7/9/13)



A Louisville, Ky. resident was the victim of a home invasion while caring for his mother. According to local authorities, at 10 a.m. three young males kicked in the door of the home. The resident was able to get a firearm and fire at the intruders. One of the intruders was shot at least twice, and received serious injuries that required medical treatment. The police are still looking for the two additional perpetrators.

<strong>From The Armed Citizen Archives</strong>

<em>April 1967:</em> Awakened by suspicious noises, Mrs. Catherine Drains, who lives behind her Los Angeles, Calif., record shop, got her .38 cal. revolver just as two shadowy figures broke open her front door. She wounded one in the upper arm, the other in the stomach. Police arrested both. (<em>Los Angeles Herald-Examiner</em>)]]>

      <![CDATA[About seven years ago, while performing a pre-dawn fill up, three beefy criminals with pork rinds on their breath came out of nowhere and demanded cash. It was dark, I was the only person in the gas station and the attendant was too busy hiding behind his security-bar barrier to call the police.



I was once young, bulletproof and capable of out-toughing any thug, but youth is a passing fad. Then I was just an old man surrounded by bulbous youngsters, my phone was in the truck, along with my knife and all I had in my hand was a gas nozzle. Then I had a moment of genius. If they presented a gun I’d douse them in unleaded (regular, of course, since there’s no reason for me to buy expensive cologne for someone I’d just met), then they’d realize if anyone took a shot it would be instant criminal flambé.



Unfortunately, it was obvious these were not the kind of guys who took high school chemistry. Instead, they took Meth Cookery 101 I surmise, a popular elective in some parts of the country that doesn’t include basic combustion in its syllabus. I surrendered my paltry cash-$10-and counted my blessings that all the numbers on my credit cards had them convinced there could be math involved.



Before you indict me for poking fun at what was a very dangerous situation, it gets more confusing. Before I ever got out of my vehicle, I drove around that parking lot two full times, scanning the bushes in back with my headlights, looking for predatory junk foodies like them (bars and bulletproof glass on the station windows were a catalyst).



I couldn’t figure out what I did wrong, and even asked officers participating in a law enforcement SWAT team match several years ago. “Make yourself a hard target,” was the most memorable advice I received. The Baltimore-area officer wasn’t talking about bulking, arming and Kevlaring up, either.



Our daily habits tell criminals if we’re an easy victim, he explained. Yes, the odds are low the same bad guy is following you all the time, but they’re out there, 24 hours a day, scanning the landscape and watching for an effortless score. It’s a lazy man’s profession. There are exceptions we can’t avoid, though, including druggies desperate for a fix and mouth breathers-the situation I encountered, I surmise. Err on the side of caution. Assume someone is watching, even in the darkest hours.



There are a lot of things you can do to minimize your exposure, though, and Paul Rackley’s <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/blog_list.php?cat_id=48" target="_blank">blog</a> often covers those subjects. It’s a great resource.



At my age I already do some of them. I park under bright lights because that’s the only place I can see parking stripes at night. Someone from the family always insists on accompanying me because I get lost easily. I’m really not assessing the safety before I venture out of the store, I just can’t remember where the car is. And, I’m really not looking for routes to escape in an emergency, just locating the nearest bathroom before we watch the movie.



Immediately after my encounter with the saturated-fat trio I took the course, and applied for and secured my concealed-carry permit. When lawful, I have my gun and license. I suggest you do the same. I’d still hand over the 10 spot, but unlike years ago, if they pointed a gun at me today, I’d have no choice but to let the air out of their spare tires.]]>

    <title>Breaking in Precision 1911s</title>

      <![CDATA[After deciding to obtain a concealed-carry permit for my self-defense handgun, I began researching handguns styles, calibers and features. I knew I wanted something compact and easy to conceal, but powerful enough to authoritatively stop a perpetrator.



I looked at both pistols and revolvers, and seriously considered a snubnose .357 Mag., but in the end decided on a semi-auto. Since I already owned a 9 mm, I decided to go with a larger caliber-a .40 S&amp;W or .45 ACP.  An acquaintance had a SIG P226 for sale with both .40 and .357 Sig barrels. The gun was a little bigger than I wanted, but I was interested in the dual calibers and would have bought it if we could have agreed on price.



Eventually, I wandered into a little hunting/gun shop in Tupelo, Miss. It was running a pretty good sale and I picked up a <a href="http://www.kimberamerica.com/" target="_blank">Kimber</a> Ultra Carry in .45 ACP for $660, plus tax. This was one of the early models featuring a skeletonized trigger and hammer, along with diamond-checkered rubber grips and black, low-profile combat sights. At the same time, I bought some <a href="http://www.winchester.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Winchester</a> white box ammunition-because that gun was just begging to be fired-and headed to the hill in my parents’ pasture that served as my home-range backstop.



Even though it took time to get used to the recoil of the .45 chambering in such a small package, the gun was quite accurate. The trigger was light and crisp, allowing me to produce small groups at a variety of distances. It also ran fairly well with the full-metal-jacket rounds, but there were a few hiccups, namely a couple of failures to feed, during the 100-round session. I just assumed the problem was being unfamiliar with the powerful recoil of the compact handgun. It wasn’t until a few weeks later when I ran some high-grade hollow points through the gun that I started wondering if there was a problem.



With hollow-point ammunition, my Ultra Carry failed to feed once or twice per magazine. It only took a small push to get the gun back in action, but since I was planning to use it as my primary defensive handgun, I was concerned. Reliability was more important than power and concealment, so I regulated it to a cool-looking range gun and went to my <a href="http://www.berettausa.com/" target="_blank">Beretta</a> 92 as my carry gun.



Over the next few months of range use, I noticed the gun started running well with FMJ ammunition. I swapped over to hollow points, and only had a problem every few magazines. It was as if the gun was beginning to realize the point of its existence. Then at around 500 rounds, it’s as if everything just clicked, and the gun started running flawlessly with all types of .45 ACP ammo. It was then that I realized that the gun merely needed a break-in period.



Reflecting on more than a decade of shooting and self-defense research, I have seen numerous high-quality 1911s require that same 400- to 500-round break-in period. The brand made little difference, as long as it was one of the popular semi-custom guns-Kimber, <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CustomContentDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=750001&amp;catalogId=750051&amp;content=11001" target="_blank">Smith &amp; Wesson</a>, <a href="http://www.springfield-armory.com/" target="_blank">Springfield</a>. If the gun had tight tolerances, it needed breaking in. It even says so in the manual that comes with each Kimber 1911 handgun, which I didn’t read at the time of purchase.



“Kimber 1911s are built with extremely tight tolerances,” said a Kimber spokesman. “The barrel bushing and slide have to break into one another.”



The Kimber manual explains a fairly specific process that begins with cleaning and lubricating the gun before firing 100 to 150 rounds of quality FMJ ammunition at the range. Users should then clean and lube the gun again, and continue the process until running 400 to 500 rounds through the gun.



The reason for this is the tolerances between parts, which are much tighter than the M1911A1s with which so many people are familiar. The 1911s used by U.S. troops in World War I, World War II and beyond were built for reliability on a battlefield, rather than pinpoint accuracy. They were rugged, work-horse pistols built with the best practices of the time, which earned them their iconic status. However, technology has greatly improved during the past century. Today, high-end 1911 pistols are built on state-of-the-art CNC machines with tolerances in the thousandths of an inch. The new processes make for more accurate and much tighter guns coming off the factory floor. Kimber actually mates a barrel to a slide so that the pair goes through the entire process together, with over 200 inspection points along the way.



Exacerbating this issue is powerful recoil in a small package. Full-size, all-steel 1911s weigh close to 3 pounds, while aluminum-frame compacts weigh less than 2 pounds. While 10 to 12 ounces doesn’t seem like much, unless it’s riding all day on the hip, that extra weight really helps dampen felt recoil. That extra snap from a lightweight compact can even catch experienced shooters by surprise, leading to “give” in the shooting wrist, commonly known as limp-wristing, which can prevent the recoil spring from fully engaging and having the strength to bring the slide back to battery. As such, it is just as important to familiarize yourself with the pistol.



“It is important to break yourself into the gun,” said a representative from Kimber. “Users need to clean and lubricate the gun properly, and learn the gun.”



Learning the gun is crucial, as the trigger and sights on every firearm brand are different. Sure, most folks can pick up any standard firearm and perform fairly well, but a gun’s owner usually has an edge over others with his or her gun because of familiarity.



Finally, a concealed-carry handgun needs a break-in period due to the need for absolute assurance that it will fire when needed. Sure, there are pistols that will run almost any quality ammunition straight out of the box, but I would still never consider carrying a semi-auto that I hadn’t personally fired at least 300 times, and preferably more. I have to have confidence in the gun I carry.



The Kimber Ultra Carry riding my hip in a <a href="http://miltsparks.com/" target="_blank">Milt Sparks</a> Versa Max II holster on a daily basis has sent thousands of rounds downrange. I’ve fired it dirty. I’ve fired it wet. I’ve run all manners of ammunition through it, including some very dirty reloads that I thought might choke it up, but didn’t. It’s beat up and there is a slight rattle somewhere on the inside. However, it fires to point of aim every time the trigger is pressed, regardless of conditions. And that is why you break in a gun: You are trusting it with your life.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Also to my fellow old guys, remember that new design pistols need more oil than old loose .45 army pistols [(]as we used to call them[)].  The 'skim coat' of oil on the old .45 was plenty, but that same skim coat on my glock and my sig led to jams.  Now I use two full drops on each side of the slide rails and one inside the slide where the barrel chamber meets the slide and they work perfectly. <!--mobile-->]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[That reliability thing is what keeps revolvers relevant. While revolvers can be tossed in a drawer and come up ready in 50 years, autos need on-going attention because their recoil and magazine springs weaken and need to be replaced. When's the last time you replaced any springs? But a revolver's most important selling point is power, assuming your cartridge choice is meaningful. Taurus offers their small and light Tracker in .44 Magnum which can be loaded down or used with .44 Specials, depending on the amount of lace on your panties. But before you dismiss it out of hand for being too powerful to shoot, let me point out that the porting and the ribber grips tame the recoil to the point that you will never remember feeling it after shooting the bad guy. Another advantage of the .44 is that 300-pound bangers that are high on drugs and wrapped in heavy winter clothing will have met their match. No, you don't need 240-grain bullets for this mission so choose the lighter-recoiling 200-grain hollow points. I am glad that Mr. Rackley has chosen to carry his .45 instead of his 9mm; want to keep him around for more great articles. ]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I disagree that tighter 'tolerances' require more break-in.  Car engines used to require break-in.  They are now built to tighter tolerances so they no longer require it.  Perhaps tighter 'clearances' is what is meant.  My 40 years of machine design experience taught me that in order to build to tighter clearances, you must build with tighter tolerances to avoid break-in.  ]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I own 5 kimbers; TLE ULTRA,  Custom Crimson Carry II, Custom II, and a Pro Carry II. I have purchased all of them new and never really had break in problems.  On my Custom II I manually cycled the slide for 500 times and maybe that helped as I use it for IPSC steel events. For the other models that I have listed I think it is important to note that they are aluminum frames, and much more important to note that the full size models have aluminum feed ramps.  The aluminum feed ramps will quickly  erode from some types of JHP.  So if your trying to break in your aluminum frame 1911 with JHPs, know what type of feed ramp you have, otherwise some of those feeding issues can be down right destructive.  ]]></comment_content>

Won't harp on him not reading it at first - many don't, especially if they're already familiar with guns - but let's make a rule:  read it anyway.  Just once.  You'll read a lot of legalese but there is probably at least one thing in there that you don't know, even if you're an experienced shooter.]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[I have had a number of Colt 1911s from pre-70s series guns, Gold Cups, aluminum and steel Commanders and a series 80 Officer's ACP.  All these guns were bought new.
My first 1911 purchased retailed for $90.  I have had a Ruger P85 since 1986, a nice gun but too big for comfortable CCH.  
The Colts' except for the Gold Cups all had miss fitting barrels with the barrel throat extending beyond the feed ramp.  This should be slightly ahead of the frame feed ramp.  
I also have a Springfield Armory 1911 which I got used in a trade.  The barrel is properly fitted.
Parts do not require a mirror polish, but tool marks should run in the direction of the movement, whether it is the slide or the cartridge.
Cleaning to remove factory anti-rust oil is essential and while cleaning examine the parts.  Put the barrel on teh slide and secure it with the slide stop pin.  Then seat the barrel on the frame and besure the path from feed ramp to barrel is matched or with the barrel just slightly [[]a 1/64- 1/32 inch] and make sure the rotary milling cutter that cut the frame ramp and the barrel throat did not leave deep or sharp grooves.
Makes sure there are no burrs on either the frame or slide.  Break the sharp edges inside teh frame and slide.  Make sure the breech face is smooth because the cartridge case has to slide up the face.  Make sure the extractor tunnel is clean and the hook on the extractor is properly relieved and polished.
When the gun is re-assembled, press don on the barrel hood to see that barrel is up and tightly locked.
The only tools you need for all this is a sheet of 600-1000 grit wet/dry paper and an old ballpoint pen to use as a form.
After you do this, you can finish break-in with one 50 round box of ammo.
I look forward to getting a chance to buy a 5 and 4-1/4 Ruger SR1911 and SR1911C.
Maybe their factory assemblers know what to see.]]>

        <![CDATA[I too am sold on the 1911 as a great carry gun for personal defense. I use two different

guns. A Sig 1911 target of which I have fire several different types of ammo and I can remember about 3 jams out of about 4000 rounds and I'm fairly sure it was a week spring in the mag because it was always on the last round. Best gun I ever purchased accurate as hell. My other 1911 is a Colt

Combat Commander result about the same as the Sig not as tight as the Sig.

Because it is a little shorter in size I carry it

Most the time.<!--mobile-->]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[FOR PETE: Pistol recoil springs wear out from fatigue [(]compression by firing[)]. Magazine springs wear out from fatigue [(]being compressed over time in a loaded magazine[)]. An e-mail to your pistol manufacturer might give you some guidelines on when to replace them but good luck on that. A better source of general information is available at WolffGunsprings, FAQ section. While Wolff is an excellent source for all things springy, let me try to be more specific. Have you noticed in the product reviews that 5-inch 1911s firing 230-grain bullets chronograph from the mid 700s to the mid 900s in fps? Factory 1911 recoil springs are usually 16-pound and are considered a good all-around choice. But, if you load your 1911 with full-power 900+ fps loads then you [(]and your gun[)] would be better served with an 18 1/2-pound recoil spring. But if you change to the heavier recoil spring, you will probably need to install a stronger magazine spring. Why? The magazine spring now has to raise the next round quicker in order to beat the now faster-moving slide as it slams forward with increased vigor imparted by the stronger recoil spring. So how do you know if you need a stronger magazine spring or if your magazine spring is just plain worn out? The only way to tell is to load a magazine and see if the gun runs properly, especially the last round or two when the magazine spring is at its weakest. To make your magazine springs last longer, rotate your magazines, one month loaded and then one month unloaded so the springs can rest. A while back I started using Wolff's Extra Power 18 1/2-pound recoil spring and Extra Power magazine springs in my 1911. Reliability is perfect, both with heavy 230-grain Gold Dot loads using Blue Dot and light 200-grain plated target loads, thanks to the quick impulse supplied by a brisk load of Bullseye. For all the above, you can see why savvy gun owners are more qualified to own autos while the more casual gun owners would be better served with revolvers.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I have two Kimbers, both less than two years old. I bought first, the Custom Covert II and the second buy, was Kimber's Gold Combat RL II. Kimber builds some great looking and more importantly functioning 1911s, as well as, rifles, but that is a different subject. The key to firing any brandnew 1911, is breaking it in, especially as the author of the article noted, because the 1911s of today, are being built with very tight tolerances, compared with 1911s of the past[(]i.e. 1911 - 1991[)]... especially with high end 1911s. When it comes to 1911s, I think Kimber takes the winning position, amongst guns that are factory made and come off a production line[(]though they do some custom work to certain guns and even more to others[)]. Obviously, if you want the best 1911, you will be spending several thousands of dollars. I have the Gold Custom RL II, which was at the time and I believe still is Kimber's most expensive 1911, priced at $2,400 approximately, while truly custom guns, with a lot of hand fitting will start off at $3,200 and above. I am not sure if a Blackhawk, Cabot, Ed Brown, or Les Baer would work that much better or tighten up your groupings. I think it depends more on the shooter, than the gun... but that is my personal take[(]of course, there are always exceptions to the rule[)]. If I was given two guns and told: fire these and tell us, which is a Kimber and which is a Blackhawk 1911, I most likely couldn't. Therefore I saved some money and went with Kimber, over Blackhawk or Ed Brown. Though, the fit and finish on the fully custom guns, that were handbuilt and fitted are great looking and I am sure function, even better. Comparing it though with my Kimber Gold Custom RL II, I doubt I could honestly tell or justify the extra money I would spend on one of those 'handbuilt' 1911s, when Kimber is more than adequate in looks and function. As I said before though, it all depends on the shooter. So for me, I can not shoot any better with a Blackhawk, than I could with a Kimber or Colt. Regardless of what level 1911 you may buy, if it is brand new, you absolutely have to take it out to the range and get 400 to 600 rounds through it, before she'll start to run like she was built to. Undoubtedly, the 1911 is very reliable, accurate, and deadly, thus making it perfect for concealed carry and personal protection, after all our military to some degree still carries, the 100 plus year old gun. If it is good enough for the U.S. military to carry for over a 100 years, then it works for me. In fact, the Marines just received for themselves some brand new Colt M1911s. ]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I have purchase 3 Kimbers in the last 12 months: Ultra CDP II, Tactical Pro II, and just last week, the Warrior SOC. All are impressive precision handguns. On looks alone, they're top drawer. I was disappointed however with the first, the Ultra CDP II, because it had frequent FTF and an occasional FTE issues, the first couple of trips shooting. A local gunsmith pointed out that tighter tolerances take longer to break in, as Kimber acknowledges in their Owner's Manuals. Sure enough, at about 400 rounds downrange, the problems began to resolve, and now with about 1000 rounds through the weapon, it operates as smoothly as one can imagine. Because of this experience, I purchased the other two Kimbers.  All three are more accurate than the shooter. Not quite the cost of a Wlson or Baer, they are still a significant investment. But you get what you pay for.]]></comment_content>

        <![CDATA[Good article. Most new handgun owners never even shoot their pistol 300-500 rounds, thinking that a box or two of ammo is a lot of ammo. They need to know that any firearm requires a break-in period to reach it's true potential. 

Offtopic - Noticed someone commenting that mag springs wear out by being compressed/loaded over time. False, that is old wives tales. Any machinist or metallurgist will tell you, as will most any article on the matter, that magazine springs wear out because of use/repeated compression, not leaving them loaded. You can load a good magazine and leave it loaded for decades and it will function just fine if stored properly so that it doesn't rust or collect dust. ]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[MAGAZINE SPRING LIFE: THE TECHNICAL EXPLANATION. When a load is applied to a piece of metal it deflects first elastically and if the load is high enough also plastically. Elastic deflection is when the material after unloading returns to its previous shape/geometry. At plastic deflection the metal receives a permanent deformation and does not return to its previous geometry after unloading. It is the elastic part of the deflection which is used to receive the deflection in durable springs. The function of stress and deflection is described in Hooks law. Two more material properties are of great interest for springs: creep and relaxation. One physical phenomenon with metals is that at stress below the yield strength of the material a very slow plastic deformation takes place. In the spring branch this is called creep when a spring under constant load loses length and it is called relaxation when a spring under constant compression loses load. How much creep/relaxation depends on the temperature, the stress in the metal, the metals yield strength and the time. Most springs are subject to some amount of relaxation during their life span even at room temperature. Relaxation is different than ordinary set.  A highly stressed spring will set the first several times it is pressed, but within 5 to 10 cycles it has set as much as it is going to set. Relaxation of springs is a function of a fairly high stress [(]but usually lower that required to cause set[)] over a period of time.  A SPRING HELD AT A CERTAIN STRESS WILL ACTUALLY RELAX MORE IN A GIVEN TIME THAN A SPRING CYCLED BETWEEN THAT STRESS AND A LOWER STRESS.  THE REASON IS THAT IT SPENDS MORE TIME AT THE HIGH STRESS. With all the variables involved in the design and manufacture of pistol magazines, it is impossible to state categorically the spring life of every magazine ever made under any and all scenarios of loaded/unloaded time. But believe that springs wear out faster when magazines are left loaded/compressed. Take you autos to the range and prove that your magazines run perfectly. Better to find out that you have a single-shot pistol at the range than in your bedroom some night.  ]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Regarding magazine spring longevity, the only post here that is worth reading is the one by J. Ramirez from Jan 31 2014. No offense to Bigfoot, but I am concerned that a newcomer to 1911s or semi-autos in general will worry about magazine springs. The reason there are still people who believe that you have to rotate magazines is because if you rotate quality magazines, they will work. If you don't rotate quality magazines, they still work. So the people who rotate them make the mistake of thinking they work because they rotate them. They are free to keep thinking that if they want to. The rest of us can follow Ramirez's advice.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks, Tom H. for the good info.  I think Bigfoot was trying to answer my question to him, which he never did.  He said if you don't keep your auto pistol in good repair by changing the springs you should just use a revolver.  But every revolver I ever heard of operates on springs.  My question was why revolver springs don't wear out from use or lack of use.  Instead I got a Wikipedia paragraph on mettalurgy.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Well guys, you can search the gun forums on the Internet and get lots of opinions as to spring life in magazines. I tried to do better by going to several scientific sites for my answer. But what say we go to the expert, Mr. Rackley? He has a Blog article entitled Swapping Mags which kind of addresses this issue. In it he states: 'THE FIRST STEP IS TO HAVE MULTIPLE MAGAZINES FOR YOUR GUN SO THAT THEY CAN BE ROTATED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND SO YOU CAN STILL CARRY THE GUN IF A MAGAZINE GOES BAD. PERSONALLY, I HAVE FOUR MAGAZINES FOR MY KIMBER, WHICH I ROTATE MONTHLY. TWO ARE ALWAYS LOADED, ONE IN THE GUN WITH A SPARE, WHILE TWO REST UNLOADED IN THE SAFE.' So, Mr. Rackley, do you know for a fact if a magazine spring weakens if the magazine is stored loaded; do they weaken from loading and unloading; or do they just last forever no matter how they are used or abused? There are lots of loaded magazines out there that have spent years sleeping in dark drawers; are they ready for that bump in the night?]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Sorry, for some reason it never posted there. I'll just say in a nutshell then, I put 4,500 rounds through a revolver once, and the cylinder timing went south before the springs did, with just a little perceived wear on the springs and no impairment of function on their part. So they would eventually go out if not for that, but revolver springs are for the most part very robust which is probably the short answer. And we would put more than 3,000 rounds through our competition 1911 magazines before retiring them, and could feel only a slight loss of spring tension. I once kept some  fully loaded mags in my gunsafe for 12 years and they hardly lost their tension, much less than from constant use, although they were of very high quality, not milspec. So I'm in the camp below, that constant wear is harder on springs than constant load with no use, as long as they are high quality and well tempered. But its still smarter to recommend swapping mags out on occasion, and no need to worry if left compressed for several months.]]></comment_content>

      <![CDATA[The handgun adopted as the “U.S. Pistol, M9” in 1985 has its roots in Italy’s Beretta Model 1951 or Brigadier. Beretta introduced a double-action 9x19 mm NATO pistol with a frame-mounted safety and a 15-round capacity-using a similar open-top slide and barrel arrangement-in 1976 under the Model 92 name. The safety was moved to the slide in 1979, and that pistol, the 92S1, with an ambidextrous safety/decocker and reversible magazine catch was tested by the U.S. Air Force in 1979. Several other small changes were made before the 92SB-F was formally adopted by the U.S. military as the M9. A slide capture device was added in 1989. The civilian equivalent of the M9 is the Model 92FS.



The 9x19 mm NATO M9’s adoption was part of the Dept. of Defense’s efforts to standardize handgun ammunition with our NATO allies and field one handgun for all U.S. armed services. Some of the U.S. contract guns were made in Gardone, Italy, but most have been made at Beretta USA’s Accokeek, Md., factory. The latest improvement to the M9 came with the M9A1, which the Marine Corps ordered in 2006, and a Picatinny rail was added to the dust cover.



The U.S. military reaffirmed its initial decision to go with the M9 in a January 2009 <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/W9031_TAR-6876.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-27956" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="W9031_TAR-6876" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/W9031_TAR-6876-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>announcement of a contract for up to 450,000 Model 92FS pistols. It was the largest single military pistol contract awarded by the U.S. government since World War II.



All told, by December 2013, Beretta had produced around 4.2 million Model 92s and its variants since the double-action 9x19 mm NATO gun was introduced. The U.S. M9 has distinguished itself time and again at the proving grounds, in the field and in war, and it appears the M9 will remain the standard U.S. military sidearm for the foreseeable future.



<strong>Disassembly Instructions</strong>



Clear the pistol by removing the magazine, retracting the slide, and checking the chamber <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/W9031_TAR-6880.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-27957" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="W9031_TAR-6880" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/W9031_TAR-6880-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>and magazine well to make sure the chamber is empty and the gun unloaded.

With the slide forward and the hammer down, press the disassembly latch release button (27) (Fig. 1) and swing the disassembly latch (19) down and forward (Fig. 2). Allow the slide assembly to move forward off the frame (18).



With the slide assembly resting upside down on a firm surface, lift the recoil spring guide (17) from its step on the locking block (2) (Fig. 3) and, while restraining the guide, remove the spring (16) and guide to the rear. Push the plunger (3) at the rear of the barrel underlug (1) to detach the locking block from the slide lugs (Fig. 4). Move the barrel forward to clear the extractor (6) and remove it from the slide.



That completes basic field-stripping of the Beretta 92FS. Further disassembly is not recommended by Beretta unless performed by a competent gunsmith. Nevertheless, here is the full disassembly.



Remove the stocks (44), taking care not to lose the stock screw washers (62). Press the <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/W9031_TAR-6943.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-27958" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="W9031_TAR-6943" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/W9031_TAR-6943-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>back of the magazine release button (41) down and away for removal. Reinstalling the magazine release can be done with the button oriented to the left or right.



Depress the upper arm of the trigger bar spring (26) from its groove in the underside of the trigger bar (25) and slowly release the spring out and away to the right. Remove the trigger bar. Pull the slide catch (21) out to remove the catch and its spring (20). The trigger pin (23) can be drifted out to the left, freeing the trigger (22) and its spring (24).



Drift out the hammer spring cap spring pin (43) to free the cap (37) and slowly release tension on the hammer spring (36) to remove. Tapping out the hammer pin (34) will allow the removal of the hammer (33) and strut (35). Drift out the sear pin (40) to release the sear (38) and its spring (39) into the magazine well. Tap out the hammer release lever pin (31) and the ejector spring pin (32) to free the ejector (30) and the hammer release lever (29) for removal upward from the frame. Remove the firing pin block lever (59) by lifting up and out.

Pull the right safety lever (57) to the right for removal. Tap out the firing pin retaining spring pin (54) to remove the firing pin block (53) and its spring (52). With a punch, dislodge the firing pin plunger (15), depress the rear face of the firing pin (12), and pull the left safety lever (14) up and to the left for removal, taking care not to lose the safety plunger (56) and its spring (55), the trigger bar release plunger (10) and its spring (11). Slowly release pressure on the firing pin to remove it and its spring (13). Drift out the extractor pin (7) and pry out the extractor (6) and extractor spring (8).



To disassemble the magazine, use a punch to depress the stud on the lock plate (50). Release the magazine base (51) by sliding it forward, taking care to restrain the magazine spring (49) and lock plate as tension is released.

Reassembly is in reverse order.

      <![CDATA[Make ready. Fire!” The range commands at <a href="http://www.gunsite.com/main/" target="_blank">Gunsite Academy</a> were ingrained in my mind since, for the past three days, I had done little else besides put lead on paper and steel targets and use my camera and notebook to record the experience. The reports from the pistols-mine and those wielded by the 10 or so other media representatives-and the familiar recoil of the gun against my now slightly sore hands were still as exhilarating and exciting as ever. As the drill ended I re-holstered my gun-by now a well-practiced and fluid motion-checked my target and prepared for the next five-shot string. With any other M1911-style pistol this would have required a reload, but since my classmates and I were using <a href="http://www.para-usa.com/2013/index.php" target="_blank">Para USA’s</a> Pro Custom pistols, with a magazine capacity of 14 rounds plus one round in the chamber, we were able to conduct three iterations with each magazine. This was just one of the advantages Para hoped to highlight during its re-launch event hosted by Gunsite in Paulden, Ariz. I had been invited, along with other industry notables, to put the new Paras through the wringer and to thoroughly test the company’s products during a three-day pistol course at the acclaimed shooting school. The results of the event and subsequent evaluations at NRA headquarters point to a promising future for Para USA, but to put the current models into perspective, it’s worth looking briefly at Para’s past.



Para-Ordnance was founded in the mid-1980s by friends and firearm enthusiasts Ted Szabo and Thanos Polyzos in Ontario, Canada. Without the pedigree of historic gunmakers or credibility offered by “Made in the U.S.A.” markings, the firm had an uphill battle ahead, especially if it hoped to capture part of the American consumer market. While its first offering-a non-firearm, dye-marking “gun” designed to resemble the MAC 10-found little traction, the Para team had better luck developing enhancements for a tried-and-true American classic: John Browning’s M1911. Prior to the production of complete firearms, Para-Ordnance marketed frame kits for M1911s that could be used with existing slide assemblies, but were wide enough to accept Para’s double-column magazine that essentially doubled the ammunition capacity of the pistol. The kits received warm welcome from shooters who sought the larger payload offered by 9 mm Luger semi-automatics like the <a title="Read Mark Keefe's story on the M9. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=27953&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=24" target="_blank">Beretta M9</a>, but did not want to give up the fight-stopping capabilities of the .45 ACP cartridge. It did not take long for Para to translate this success into a full line of complete M1911-style pistols of both single- and double-stack design.



To put on display the reliability and quality of its product, Para-Ordnance sponsored professional shooter Todd Jarrett who used Para firearms to claim countless titles and perform astounding feats of marksmanship. Competition not only brought Para success and fame, but it also became a fundamental part of the corporate culture and opened a key consumer market to which the company could cater. Further innovations brought even more recognition to the Canadian gun tinkerers. In 1998, Para began incorporating its <a title="The Para Compainion utilizes the LDA trigger. " href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=14139&amp;cat=20&amp;sub=21" target="_blank">Light Double Action</a> (LDA) trigger system into some of its pistols. The LDA guns utilized a top-pivot trigger blade with a long, though fairly light, pull to cock and release the hammer, providing shooters with the heretofore unattainable double-action-only M1911. Five years later, the Para Power Extractor replaced the standard extractor in all the company’s pistols, its main advantages being a larger claw to better engage the cartridge case and an articulated design that resolved tension-related issues sometimes encountered in its G.I. counterparts. In addition to pistol enhancements, Para-Ordnance dabbled briefly in the modern sporting rifle market with its semi-automatic, AR-style Tactical Target Rifle (TTR) that utilized the delayed-impingement gas system (DIGS) to cycle the bolt.



By the late 2000s, Para’s creativity and competition-quality firearms were well established, but if the company was to be a serious gunmaker in the American market, the firm’s management thought it was going to have to move to the United States. Pineville, N.C., a suburb of Charlotte, was selected as Para’s new headquarters both for its pool of skilled workers and its heritage of gunsmithing. It didn’t hurt that North Carolina is a business-friendly state and not at all averse to firearms manufacturing. So, by 2010 Para’s operation was set up and, to seal the deal, the company re-branded to Para USA. An independent Para USA was very short-lived though, as just a couple years later the company was purchased by Freedom Group, a conglomerate of firearm-related companies. At the time, it was no secret that Freedom Group was working to acquire a handgun manufacturer, and it seems Para’s southward move made it the lead contender for acquisition. That Remington, Freedom Group’s flagship brand, was also headquartered in North Carolina was a convenient coincidence.



Though the changes all seemed positive, the rapid succession of events from about 2009 to 2012 left the company changed, both in management and location, and without the fire or direction-at least in the eyes of the shooting public-that it once possessed. In fact, it seemed that the light had just gone out, and the future of Para USA was uncertain. I personally felt this way after my first professional contact with Para USA at the 2012 SHOT Show. Although there was no question in my mind about the knowledge or passion of the individual Para employees, the company’s products seemed to be a collection of randomly modified M1911s, lacking any sense of cohesion. And my questions about future plans were met with blank stares from representatives.



This experience quickly came to mind when I received an invitation to the Para USA re-launch, and I truly hoped that event would reverse my previous conceptions about the company. I was not disappointed. Upon arrival I was greeted by very professional media representatives who were visibly excited for the week to come. As well, I was quickly introduced to Travis Tomasie, an incredibly talented and distinguished professional shooter who not only <em>is</em> Team Para, but who might also be the nicest guy I’ve ever met. I don’t know if Para USA could have found a better spokesperson; I found Travis to be genuinely excited about the products we were testing, extremely knowledgeable about the M1911 platform, and a world-class shooter-an attribute that not only lends credibility to his, and by extension Para’s, opinions, but also provides a charismatic quality that makes one want to shoot the way he shoots and use the gear he’s using.



For the first two days of the course we used early-production versions of Para’s Pro Custom .45s, exclusively. The combination of using a competition-ready pistol and having Tomasie there to assist the Gunsite instructors confirmed that competitive shooting was still a big part of Para’s DNA and would be an important area of focus for future product lines. Although my pistol ran flawlessly throughout the course, there were a small number of malfunctions experienced by others in the class, particularly relating to extraction and ejection. It was unclear whether the culprit was extensive shooting in a very dusty environment or an issue with the extractor tension. In all cases the issues were quickly resolved at the operator level, and it was reassuring to see the Para team come together and really examine each gun that went down, taking pictures and notes about the problems for use in future design and development. They stood behind their product and sincerely wanted to understand and correct all issues experienced, and Gunsite provided an ideal proving ground with a rigorous course of fire.



<a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/PARABlackOpsRecon_web1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-27970" title="PARABlackOpsRecon_web" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/PARABlackOpsRecon_web1-300x211.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="211" /></a>



After two days of working with the Pro Customs, I was itching to see and shoot the rest of Para’s offerings, and on the third day they obliged. What I saw in the five or six pistols I handled that day was exactly what I thought was missing the year before at SHOT-direction. The sampling of guns was cohesive, well thought out and separated into recognizable classes that would satisfy the large and diverse M1911 market. We had representative models from the Expert line of pistols, which are economically priced but nonetheless possess some premium features like fiber-optic front sights. Experts are available in full-size, commander and compact configurations, as well as single- and double-stack designs. Several Elites were also present, and these pistols are all single-stacks but come standard with upgrades like ramped match-grade barrels. And no catalog would be complete in this era without a tactical line-replete with rails and tritium night sights-and for that Para USA introduced its Black Ops brand.



While range time at Gunsite was excellent for familiarization and giving the pistols a good workout, a complete evaluation, under full <em>American Rifleman</em> protocol, was required to determine if the new Paras are really up to snuff. To that end I chose the Black Ops Recon and the Elite Stainless. I thought these were fitting choices as they would demonstrate some premium features that are common to most of Para’s new line-up, but they also allow for the examination of some key differences. Starting with the basics, the Recon is a commander-size-that is, possessing a 41/4-inch barrel-M1911-style pistol designed for the double-column, 14-round-capacity magazine and finished in matte black with the extremely tough Ionbond PVD finish. By comparison, the Stainless, as its name implies, retains the stainless steel finish. As well, the Elite model is a full-size gun with a 5-inch barrel and is of the single-stack design, accepting magazines that can hold eight rounds. The Recon, with its shorter barrel, measures 77⁄8 inches in overall length-3/4-inch shorter than the Elite’s 85⁄8-inch length. The two guns are of a height though, both measuring 57⁄8-inches tall, slightly taller than the original G.I. models due to the modern sight systems. Speaking of the G.I. M1911s, the two Paras are the same weight as the original, all three guns tipping the scales at 39 ounces. (All measurements are for unloaded guns with an empty magazine inserted.) The most telling measurement when comparing a double- to single-column gun is width, and here the Recon stacks up very favorably against the Elite Stainless, only 1/8-inch wider at 13⁄8 inches as opposed to 1¼ inches. Considering the double-stack magazine is nearly twice as wide as the single-stack-approximately 1 inch and ½ inch, respectively-the slight overall difference is remarkable. And take into account that the 1/8-inch difference translates into six extra cartridges, or 75 percent more ammunition, it’s easy to appreciate this feat of design and engineering.



Measurements aside, these guns pack a lot of features that are worth looking at. Starting from the top, both pistols come standard with what would otherwise be after-market sights. For the Black Ops Recon, Para used <a href="https://www.trijicon.com/na_en/index.php" target="_blank">Trijicon</a> tritium night sights that glow green even in low-light conditions. The Elite Stainless has a two-dot rear sight and a green fiber-optic front. Both proved entirely capable and easy to use. Both guns have stainless steel slides with enlarged ejection ports. As well, the internal components are much the same, including match-grade ramped barrels and EGW (Evolution Gun Works) HD extractors to replace Para’s old Power Extractor system.



<a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/PARAEliteStainless_web.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-27972" title="PARAEliteStainless_web" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/PARAEliteStainless_web-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" /></a>



Stainless steel frames are standard on the Recon and Elite, as are the skeletonized triggers that broke a 4 pounds, 5 ounces and 3 pounds, 15 ounces, respectively. The elongated beavertail grip safety and checkered mainspring housing are also the same for both. A point of divergence is the Recon’s ambidextrous thumb safety, compared to the traditional left-side-only safety on the Stainless. The Recon also features a single-notch rail on the dustcover, aggressive texturing on the frontstrap and VZ Operator machined G10 polymer grip panels. The Stainless is more traditional in these aspects with no rail, no frontstrap texturing and sporting classic, cocobolo double-diamond stocks.



In the controlled environment of the NRA Technical Range, both pistols performed admirably. Full results are tabulated, but both Paras exhibited excellent accuracy and controllability. The Recon averaged 2.33-inch groups with three types of ammunition, each evaluated through five, five-shot groups fired from a Ransom Rest at 25 yards. The smallest group measured just 1 inch and was achieved with <a href="http://libertyammunition.com/" target="_blank">Liberty Ammunition</a>’s Civil Defense load. The Stainless performed even better with an overall average of 2.07 inches and the best group measuring 1.25 inches using 185-grain <a href="http://www.hornady.com/" target="_blank">Hornady</a> Steel Match. No malfunctions of any kind were experienced during testing-an excellent showing considering the experience of some of my peers back at Gunsite. In fact, it is worth noting that through thousands of rounds and perhaps six different guns, I have yet to experience any problems from the new Paras. Combining the accuracy, reliability and bevy of features, both these guns-and from what I can tell, the entirety of the new Para USA catalog-represent an excellent value and are fine firearms for sporting or defensive use. For my money, I’ve taken a bit of a shine to the Recon, but of course what is not to like about an extended-capacity, commander-size M1911 with a winged skull laser-engraved on the slide? It’s edgy, powerful and is ready to perform under any circumstance; in a word, it’s Para.



If nothing else, my time at Gunsite and the subsequent range evaluations proved to me that Para USA is indeed back. Despite the moves and changes the company has made, changes that distanced Para from its own history and identity, this company is serious about producing quality firearms. The products I’ve tested prove that the new management, the designers and the employees, new and old, have bought-in. They’ve re-ignited the spark of innovation that put Para on the map two decades ago, and developed a cohesive selection of firearms to suit the needs of M1911 enthusiasts. Models such as the Elite Stainless or the Black Ops Recon are not the result of half-hearted gunsmithing, but the work of a committed company, with fire and direction, that is ready to take on the competition.

      <![CDATA[Frigid February is prime time for reconnecting with hunting buddies and planning that next big adventure, and this time of year there is nothing bigger than the 2014 Great American Outdoor Show in Harrisburg, Pa., Feb. 1-9. As the largest outdoor show nationwide, it will draw tens of thousands of mainstream American hunters and their families to the city’s Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex in the name of our cherished hunting and outdoor traditions.



Formerly known as the Eastern Sports and Outdoor Show, the event came to a screeching halt on Jan. 24, 2013, when show owner and promoter Reed Exhibition “postponed” it indefinitely nine days before it opened. The reason? The NRA and 350 other exhibitors and outdoor personalities announced they were boycotting the show after Reed’s decision to ban the sale and display of modern sporting rifles and high-capacity magazines at the event. Fortunately, NRA wasn’t about to allow this esteemed show go by the wayside. Now owned and operated by NRA, the newly named Great American Outdoor Show returns to Harrisburg this month for its traditional nine-day run. Attendees will navigate a 650,000-sq.-ft. exhibit hall housing nearly 1,000 exhibitors from firearm and archery manufacturers to makers of hunting and fishing gear, outfitters, outdoor retailers and wildlife artists, as well as a new shooting sports section replete with modern sporting rifles.



The exhibit hall alone is reason enough to attend, but then there are the special events. Who wouldn’t enjoy NRA Country concerts, celebrity appearances, product demonstrations, archery competitions, seminars, a Friends of NRA banquet and more? For more good news, NRA reduced admission prices to $12 for adults, $10 for seniors (65 or older) and $6 for children (ages 6-12). Multi-day and group passes are also available. To purchase tickets or find out more, visit <a href="http://greatamericanoutdoorshow.org/" target="_blank">GreatAmericanOutdoorShow.org</a> or call (866) 343-1805.]]>

      <![CDATA[<a href="https://danieldefense.com/" target="_blank">Daniel Defense</a> recently announced plans for a five-year, $20 million expansion to its Bryan County, Ga. Facility.



"We are proud to be among the nation's fastest growing private companies according to Inc. 500|5000 Magazine," said Marty Daniel, president and CEO of Daniel Defense. "Maintaining the level of growth we've experienced over the last 10 years requires a long-term vision, continued momentum, while maintaining the level of quality expected by our customers."



The expansion will increase manufacturing and administrative space at its Bryan County facility to more 100,000 square feet.



"This is yet another step toward bringing every part of the manufacturing process in-house, which will in turn give us ultimate control over quality assurance," exclaimed Daniel.



Daniel Defense opened its 47,000 square foot facility in Bryan County in 2009, and this is not the company’s first expansion. In 2012, Daniel Defense opened a 90,000 square foot facility in Ridgeland, S.C.]]>

      <![CDATA[Recently, I started my oldest child down the path of firearms enlightenment. Since she is only 3 years old, some would say I’m starting her a little early, but she has asked about the object on Daddy’s hip and one day told me to “strap on my legs,” referring to my ankle holster, as we were leaving the house.



To start the conversation, I asked if she understood that Daddy carried a handgun. She said yes and pointed toward my hip. I then asked her if she was curious about Daddy’s gun and would like to learn more. She replied in the affirmative to both questions. All that, in my mind, means she’s ready to start learning.



She watched as I carefully removed my <a href="http://www.kimberamerica.com/" target="_blank">Kimber</a> from the <a href="http://miltsparks.com/" target="_blank">Milt Sparks</a> holster where it resides, ejected the magazine and removed the .45 caliber round from the chamber, and allowed her to view the handgun.



She was happy to be sharing this moment with Daddy, and it made a good segue to begin her training of what to do if she ever finds an unsecured firearm. The concept is as simple as stop, drop and roll, and is shared with youngsters through the <a href="http://www.eddieeagle.nra.org">Eddie Eagle GunSafe Program</a>. If you see a gun: Stop! Don’t touch. Leave the area. Tell an adult.



I discussed the concept multiple times, and had her repeat it back to me each time. This is just the beginning of the process, which I will build upon with regular lessons. Part of it is to control the curiosity for which children are well known by providing safe firearm handling instruction. I also told her to never mention Daddy’s gun in public, as I don’t want others realizing that I’m carrying. She seemed to understand, but I’m not stopping with a single lesson. This will be a long-term effort to teach her how to safely handle and use firearms, as well as the importance of the Second Amendment. A week later, she was still able to tell me what she is supposed to do if she encounters a gun. I’d say that is progress.]]>

      <![CDATA[What would gun magazines be without guns, ammo and-of course-shooting ranges? Allow me to walk you into the NRA Publications Tech Range and introduce our newest editor.



Recently, NRA Publications welcomed our newest brother, Jay Grazio. Jay is a stand up guy and we all look forward to watching him (and his facial hair) grow here at NRA.



A couple weeks ago I received notice that a few firearms had arrived for me. Excited and eager, I jumped up and ran down like it was my first Christmas all over again. While logging in the firearms I happened to see one was ordered by the “FNG” (fabulous new guy), Jay.



Part of this job is to manage our Publications Tech Range. Since Jay happened to have his first project, he needed a proper inception. I wish I could put into words the excitement in Jay’s voice and demeanor over going to the Pubs range, but I'll leave that up to your imagination. The small single-lane range is built for pure functionality, and is far from pristine.



“I can’t believe this is work! Having a test range at our disposal in our basement is pretty awesome,” Jay said.



Yes, Jay this is work. And I wholeheartedly agree that having a test range is awesome. That said, everything is all fun and games until someone has to clean the range-and that someone happens to be me. Thankfully, I had just cleaned so we got to work on testing the <a href="http://www.hi-pointfirearms.com/index.html" target="_blank">Hi-Point C9</a>, which you will see in a Gun Locker column in the March issue of <em><a href="http://www.shootingillustrated.com" target="_blank">Shooting Illustrated</a>.</em>]]>

    <title>The UTS-15 Shotgun</title>
    <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=28006</link>

      <![CDATA[You can never go wrong with a shotgun as part of your home-defense strategy, and a shotgun such as the new UTS-15 ups the ante when it comes to one of the conventional shotgun’s most glaring deficiencies: ammunition capacity. The brainchild of Ted Hatfield, a former staff editor for <em>American Rifleman</em>, the UTS-15 not only combines the dependability of a manually operated pump-action with the compactness of a bullpup, it offers a total on-board ammunition capacity of 15 shells.



Deciphering the UTS-15’s name reveals aspects of its design, manufacture and capabilities: The “U” is derived from United States, home of its aforementioned designer and where it’s assembled, and the “T” is from Turkey, home of Hatfield’s manufacturing partner-the UTS-15 is actually assembled in the United States using parts produced in both Turkey and the United States. The “S” is for shotgun and “15” the combined number of shells that it holds in its twin tubular magazines and chamber. The magazines can be used together, or separately-meaning the gun will feed from both, automatically alternating side to side, or you can set the gun to feed from one tube only. For example, you could have buckshot in one tube and slugs in the other, and then fire only the ammunition appropriate to the situation. Selecting magazines is as simple as moving a lever on top of the gun, which takes a fraction of a second.



The UTS-15 was not created overnight. Hatfield and Turkish engineers have been working on it for several years. A writer and editor well known in the tight-knit firearm-manufacturing community, Hatfield also has the design and manufacture of several other shotguns and muzzleloaders to his credit. That includes work at the manufacturing facility in Turkey that he started, which was supplying shotguns to some of the major firearm brands in the United States for sale under their own names. I traveled to Turkey in November 2011 to look at the UTS-15 manufacturing facilities, and can confirm that, now that the gun is finished, it was worth the wait.



The UTS-15 is a tactical-style shotgun with a bullpup design whose short overall length ensures easy maneuverability in close quarters. The gun's pistol grip allows it to be held in one hand, ready to fire, while the other hand is free to open doors, turn on light switches or deflect an aggressor. The pistol grip also gives more control and a tighter hold on the gun in the event it is grabbed during a scuffle. The gun’s construction makes use of fiber-reinforced, injection-molded polymer to keep its weight down. It is only 28.3-inches long with a flush mount choke, and it weighs 6 pounds, 13 ounces. It is chambered for 3-inch 12-gauge shotshells, which allows the use of 2½-inch and 2¾-inch shells as well.



The 18½-inch smoothbore barrel is threaded for screw-in chokes having the Beretta thread pattern. That opens a full range of options on ammunition use and pattern disbursement. The gun comes with a flush-fit, cylinder bore choke. There is also a cylinder bore, ported tactical “breeching” choke that was included as an option with the shotgun, and I used that one for the testing for this article. The end user has the option of installing any other choke, even a super-full turkey choke for ultra-tight patterns with “fine” shot, or a rifled choke to use with some sabot-style slugs.



The gun’s comb is straight and in-line with the top rail, which means that shooting it like a <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/D17731.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-28008" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="D17731" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/D17731.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="332" /></a>conventional shotgun is just about impossible because the shooter’s eye is positioned well above the bore axis. With a little practice a shooter can do well point shooting, but it’s not designed to be pointed like a conventional shotgun.



Actually, the UTS-15 is designed to be used with sights. There is a top rail that will accept sights or optics. Anything that is designed for an AR-style rifle should work fine, as the rail and the offset are similar. An optic that is around 1.6-inches from the top of the rail to the center of the optic works well. However, the offset to the barrel is greater as the barrel is below the magazine tubes on the UTS-15. The bore axis is about 4.5-inches below the optical axis. This can cause slugs to impact low, relative to line of sight, at close range; so just as with an AR-style rifle, it’s important to learn the offsets for every range at which you expect to shoot.



The gun has optional adjustable rear and front sights that mount on the top rail. The sights are machined from a solid billet of 7000-series aluminum and have a matte-black, anodized finish. The front sight has a protected, post-mounted bead that is fully adjustable for elevation. The rear sight has a large aperture ghost ring peep or flip-up V-notch, and it is fully adjustable for windage.



My aging eyes don’t deal well with iron sights, particularly in poor light, so I installed an <a href="http://aimpoint.com" target="_blank">Aimpoint Comp ML2 red-dot sight</a> with a 4-m.o.a. dot on the top rail of the shotgun. The Aimpoint red-dot sight is a great choice for a tactical shotgun as it can be very fast for target acquisition by keeping both eyes open, or be used to aim with precision when shooting slugs. Best of all, the Aimpoint dot is adjustable for intensity so it works in any lighting condition.



The UTS-15 also has an optional, integral light and laser system to illuminate the target or help aim in poor light. It mounts below the barrel and the laser is nonadjustable. In testing I found that the point of impact using Federal TruBall, 23/4-inch, 1-ounce, 1600-f.p.s. slugs was 7 inches low at 10 yards.



The stock’s length of pull is slightly more than 12 inches, the idea being that it can be used while wearing bulky clothing. This is short enough that-with heavy-recoiling loads-it sometimes tapped me in the face with the magazine selection lever. While it’s nothing more than an inconvenience as it causes no damage, it is worth noting. The buttpad is held in with just a couple of easily removable pins and the plans are to offer more options for a longer length of pull in the future.



The cheekpiece is on a hinge so that it can be opened to access the simple feeding <a href="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/utaut15.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-28009" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="utaut15" src="http://www.americanrifleman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/utaut15.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="234" /></a>mechanism to clear a jam or to clean or service the gun. As the shell exits the magazine, it drops down to align with the barrel. It is captured by a forked lever that holds it in line as it’s guided to the chamber. The bolt has a spring-loaded extractor, and the ejector is a spring-loaded pin mounted on the side of the receiver.



The gun is operated by sliding the fore-end grip under the barrel. It is close to the bore axis, which aids in point shooting, and the optional light/laser is mounted on the guide for the fore-end. Above the barrel, the twin magazines are side-by-side, and the rail is above them. Vented covers on both sides of the gun are marked with numbers indicating how many shells remain in each magazine tube.



The empty gun is loaded by opening a door on the side and pushing the follower out of the way. That allows the magazine tube to be charged with seven 2¾-inch or six 3-inch shells. With the selector switch on top set in the center, the gun will alternate between magazines to feed shells. Or the switch can be pushed to one side or the other, isolating the selected tube to allow the gun to feed from it alone.



Pushing a button underneath the buttstock releases the slide. The two-position safety is mounted on the left side similar to an AR-style rifle, while the selector on the right side is for the light or laser. The ejection port has a spring-loaded, hinged dust cover that can be closed when the gun is in battery and is held shut with a magnet. The pistol grip is plastic with a rough gripping surface. The metal trigger guard is large enough to operate the trigger while wearing gloves.



Many experts believe the pump-action shotgun is the best design for home defense. This type of shotgun is reliable, and an argument can be made that it is safer, as the shooter must actively work the action to chamber another round. As a manually operated firearm, the “driving system” is the shooter, which, at least in theory, is less prone to failure.



The gun is a lot of fun to shoot and, with its radical appearance, it is sure to gather a crowd anytime you break it out at the shooting range. It’s not limited to tactical work, either, as it makes for a unique and interesting hunting gun. I know of several hunters, including Jeff Johnston, the former executive editor of <em>American Hunter</em> who have taken turkeys with the UTS-15. It will shoot slugs well enough to hunt deer in close cover, and I plan on using it on a few rabbit hunts this winter.



I tested three of the guns extensively with birdshot, slugs and buckshot. Two were early prototypes that had a few issues. But, that was part of the development process, and this latest gun seems to have resolved the problems.



In the end I put more than 1,300 shells through the UTS-15 shotgun. In addition to depleting my ammunition supply, it gave me a lot of insight into what the gun can and cannot do. Specifically, it needs to be operated in such a way that the slide is racked fully and positively, and it does not have much forgiveness for being short-stroked. It is sensitive to slide speed for positive ejection, so slamming it hard backward and forward should ensure trouble-free operation.



While it can be operated quickly, the UTS-15 is not designed for 3-gun competition. In those sports the top shooters need to be able to reload their shotguns at a rate of half a second per shell or faster, and the design of this gun is not compatible with that reloading speed. It’s plenty fast enough to reload in a tactical, self-defense situation, but with a 15-shot capacity it’s doubtful reloading will even be necessary. The gun can be topped off before the magazine is empty, but it’s not easy or fast. You must open the door and push two shells back up into the magazine before you can add more.



The gun must be in full battery before the trigger is pulled. If it’s not, the trigger will trip, but the gun will not fire. The operator would then have to work the action again, ejecting a loaded shell, to reset the trigger before shooting.



The UTS-15 is anything but run-of-the-mill. If the user is willing to learn how to operate it according to its somewhat unique manual of arms and with appropriate alacrity, it is reliable and fast. In addition, its huge magazine capacity potentially makes it a fearsome home-defense shotgun.



Then, of course, there is the “cool factor,” which I think this shotgun has over any other, hands down. No matter if it’s hunting, target shooting or protecting your family, the UTS-15 offers a unique set of traits few other arms can match.

        <![CDATA[Because of how the gun was made it was cheap but the quality & workmanship was superb. The pump-action shotgun with it’s automatic feeding is fine when your reloading. It’s design is very “tactical” and can load up the feeding tube up to 15 shots available on fire. This is a great shotgun for professional and sportsman alike.

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/" target="_blank">Smith &amp; Wesson</a> and <a href="http://www.ruger.com/" target="_blank">Ruger</a> are going to scale down/suspend efforts to keep their handguns on California’s approved list. You can read all about it at the <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/22/smith-wesson-stop-selling-guns-california-due-micr/" target="_blank">Washington Times</a>. But, the story made me curious as to which pistols are on California’s bad boy list and why. <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/sites/oag.ca.gov/files/pdfs/firearms/removed.pdf" target="_blank">Here’s</a> the current roster, and some explanations for their inclusion, as I see it.



In a state where most of the Hollywood elite can’t count past five without holding up their other hand, a serious safety problem arises during reloads of an eight-round “magazine” (I’d say cylinder, but I’m trying to honor California’s legal terminology). Hence, on Jan. 14, a Smith &amp; Wesson 5-inch barreled .22 Long Rifle revolver joined the list.



Five target-shooting handguns chambered in rimfire were also banned on New Year’s Eve. This <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product4_750001_750051_764922_-1_757765_757752_757751_ProductDisplayErrorView_Y" target="_blank">model</a>’s seven-inch barrel defies the state’s obligatory no-more-than-five-digits-number rule. And you have to be a card-carrying member of the plastic surgeon’s union to offer two-tone finishes in the state.



On Nov. 12, the <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product4_750001_750051_765788_-1_757771_757767_757751_ProductDisplayErrorView_Y" target="_blank">Smith &amp; Wesson 500 Hunter</a> (7.5-inch barrel) even found its way onto the list. I own a version (also on that list) that sparkles brighter than a smile after a dental cleaning-not exactly concealable, and carryable only when wearing a feathered pink fedora with matching cowboy boots. However, it’s bad form if any object in the state outshines a professional-athlete’s blingware, provided by overpriced tickets, ridiculous endorsement deals and $10 concession hot dogs.



The handguns on California’s non-compliance list continues to grow. A variety of Ruger <a href="http://www.ruger.com/products/markIIICompetition/models.html" target="_blank">Mark IIIs</a> are included, each chambered in .22 Long Rifle. They’re ideal for plinking and target shooting, and if they effectively ban those lawful pursuits….well, qualified opinion on malicious attempts to suspend the Second Amendment are available the <a href="http://www.nraila.org/" target="_blank">NRA-ILA website</a>. The fine folks there know what they’re doing and, as you can see, I’m only qualified for giving political advice to liberal bureaucrats.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[I apologize if I wasn't clear. More and more guns are being included on California's 'non-approved' handguns list, and Ruger and Smith & Wesson aren't going to aggressively try to keep many of their models from joining the ridiculously long roster. And if you take a look at the current list, it's amazing some of those pistols no longer approved....I sure do apologize for any confusion. ]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[For those who are not up-to-date with the Peepuls Republik rules on appropriate handguns [(]who can be, even the cops filed a lawsuit because they couldn't figure them out[)] the far out left wing Attorney General of this state of confusion has decreed that microstamping of ammunition is now a viable technology, even though the inventor of the technology has had a change of mind and now feels it is not quite ready for prime time. As a result of legislation passed a couple of years ago and signed by that known hoplophobe, Arnie I-never-saw-a-housemaid-I-didn't-love-Schwartzenluger, any semi-auto pistol must now contain technology that will microstamp a number on the cartridge as it is fired. Ruger and S&W have said they will not ship to California. In addition all handguns have to be certified 'safe' for us poor  consumers by the aforesaid A.G. Once certified, if there is a change to the configuration, it has to be recertified. Of course there is a fee for certification I believe it is $200. Each iteration has to be certified. That is, if Ruger has the SP101 in 2.5, 3 and 4 inch barrels, each has to be certified even though the only change is in the length of the barrel. They know they can't ban handguns outright so they are going to do it a nibble at a time. So far shotguns and rifles are exempt, however the almost totally Democratic legislature is back in session determined to pass the bills that didn't make it last year. We are facing a drought of biblical proportions with scientists telling us that at times in California's past droughts have lasted as long a 100 years. Moonbeam McBrown wants to build a tunnel to bring more water from a drought stricken Northern California to an even more drought stricken SoCal. He knows where the votes are. Yet in spite of that the plans to build a multi-billion dollar low speed railroad and a multi-billion dollar tunnel continue to plow ahead. Sorry for the long rant. Guy just jabbed a real tender spot.]]></comment_content>

    <title>Beretta USA Expanding Operations, Opening Facility in Tennessee</title>

      <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.beretta.com/en-us/beretta-usa-to-locate-new-manufacturing-facility-in-sumner-county-tennessee/" target="_blank">Beretta</a> officials announced today that the company will expand its U.S. operations by building a new firearms manufacturing plant in the Gallatin Industrial Park, located in Gallatin, Tenn. The Italian-owned company-which also has a facility in Accokeek, Md.-will invest $45 million in a state-of-the-art manufacturing and R&amp;D facility.



Beretta is expected to complete construction on the facility this year. The factory will create 300 new jobs in Tennessee, and has been wholeheartedly embraced by the state's governor, Bill Haslam.



“Beretta is one of the world’s greatest companies, and their decision to expand into Tennessee speaks to the standards of craftsmanship and quality our state’s workforce embraces every day,” Haslam said. “Attracting a legendary company like Beretta reinforces our goal of becoming the No. 1 location in the Southeast for high-quality jobs. I want to thank the Beretta family for their substantial investment in Tennessee and the 300 jobs they’ll create in Sumner County.”



Jeff Reh, Beretta USA general counsel and vice-general manager, said that the Beretta family initially decided around March 2013 to expand its manufacturing and business operations outside of Maryland. Only states that had a consistent history of support for and a likelihood of future support for Second Amendment rights were considered. Gallatin was one of 80 sites (in seven states) that had been considered.



“When Beretta chooses a location for its business, we start with the possibility that we will be in that location for decades, if not hundreds of years, to come. We move forward with confidence knowing that Tennessee is a great place to do business.  We look forward to our opportunities here and we look forward to working side-by-side with our new Tennessee neighbors,” Reh said.

      <![CDATA[Alpha-TAC <a href="http://www.extremebeam.com/default.asp" target="_blank">ExtremeBeam</a> has released an affordable, long-range flashlight called the M4 Scirrako.



Machined from solid bar-stock aluminum, the M4 Scirrako features a 230 lumen bulb and ExtremeBeam’s SuperLumen technology that uses a precision-engineered reflecting cone that captures nearly all of the light produced from the LED bulb. The end result is a powerful, focusable central beam with a light projection of over 330 meters for 7 hours while on high.



The flashlight also features a micro-textured body for increased grip, tri-cut glass for greater durability, double O-ring seals for up to 30 feet of waterproof protection and an anti-glare stealth coating.



Inside the M4 Scirrako is ExtremeBeam's proprietary Anti-Recoil system that is guaranteed to protect the inner workings of the light from recoil forces up to .50 BMG.



The MSRP of the M4 Scirrako is $59.95 and includes a limited lifetime warranty that even covers destruction, no questions asked.

      <![CDATA[When I first began shooting the 1911 in competition, I was in the Marine Corps of the early 1960s. The game was NRA Outdoor Pistol-slow, timed and rapid-one handed at 50 and 25 yards. The Corps put a lot of emphasis on the sport, with Division and Marine Corps matches conducted to select the team that went to <a href="http://competitions.nra.org/championship-tournament/national-matches-at-camp-perry-ohio.aspx" target="_blank">Camp Perry</a> for the Nationals. The season started in the spring and ended after Perry. At the beginning of the Division Matches, we spent several weeks working with a training team from Marksmanship Training Unit. Issued guns were built up before each season by RTE (Rifle Team Equipment) armorers.



It was in this period of training that I was taught to handle my issued match gun in a particular way. When I mentioned this technique in another training atmosphere recently, nobody had heard of it. For a right-handed shooter I was taught to have the slide locked open and to insert a loaded magazine and fully seat it. Then, with the thumb of the left hand to hold the tip of the hammer down and release the slide lock with the right thumb. This allowed the slide to run forward, chambering a round and leaving the hammer cocked. Thus did you prepare for a string of fire.



The maneuver was said to help the longevity of the trigger job by keeping the nose of the sear out of engagement as the slide slammed violently forward. It is opposite from the combat shooter, who loads his pistol by pulling the slide fully to the rear and releasing it, which insures greater slide travel-as happens when a round is fired-and better functional reliability. I am just wondering whether or not any reader remembers this or has any comment on its value.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Honestly sounds like a way to build 'muscle memory' for using two hands to do a one hand task.  I'd think using the left hand only for operating the slide and then getting back into a bracing position would be a better way to lock it into muscle memory.  Interesting post nonetheless, because I hadn't heard of the technique you describe.  Probably with modern metallurgy, however is just overkill. ]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Wiley, yes our AMUs also taught us this technique, and they probably still do. Repeatedly releasing a fully locked back slide, especially with a full power hardball 1911 spring, will  degrade the fine sharp edge of the hammer sear relationship, eventually requiring a trigger re-work. Especially for those requiring that clean ‘glass rod’ predictable trigger break, desired for x-ring quality shots. Whether not using the technique will eventually degrade the trigger job to the point that the hammer might someday start falling to half cock position is debatable, although I’ve seen it happen in ‘wadcutter’ match pistols, pushing the edge of a minimal match acceptable trigger weight. Most AMU armorers went to great pains to give our triggers that excellent 'clean break', worthy of competition standards. And a fine trigger job is worth its weight in Gold. So this technique of holding the trigger back served to prolong the fruits of their hard labor, to our benefit. Also yes, it does not have quite as much slide travel as manually racking the slide, but not significant enough to impair proper chambering in match competition settings. And of course most speed shooting events where tenths of a second matter, do not use the technique, to shave off precious time wherever they can. But when time permits, and the slide locks back on its own from the last round, it’s a very good technique to use for the sake of prolonging an excellent trigger job. I still use the technique to this day, though admittedly would not bother to use it in a life threatening encounter.]]></comment_content>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[Got a followup to add-- In my last post here, I just realized on reflection I’ve only expounded what I’ve been taught and nothing more, without ever really questioning why. To that end, this has now made me consider the following: What is the difference between letting a slide go with or without a full magazine inserted, vs the normal operation of the gun? After all, with every shot taken, the slide impacts the frame and rebounds with the same force as manually letting it go anyways. So why bother holding the hammer back manually, if your next string of 10 shots or more might still eventually degrade your sear anyway?? On realizing this, it might make one think it isn’t worth the effort. So Is this just an ‘old wive’s tale’ then? And yet as a competitive shooter,  we would put many thousands of rounds through our guns in practice before ever needing our triggers re-worked. Well, not being a certified gunsmith, I went out and consulted a few top tier ones and came back with a more definitive answer which is Yes, this holding the trigger back technique does matter, and  here’s why. The concept is referred to as ‘trigger bounce’. First of all, there is a difference in how violently the slide slams forward with a full magazine inserted vs without, due to some energy being absorbed overcoming the friction of the round stripping off and chambering, and the extractor engaging the cartridge rim. This serves to absorb some of that shock, which is no surprise. And the second part is, that letting a slide go while loose in the hand is a different matter, vs holding tight in a formal shooting stance. A very light handed grip allows enough inertia for the sear to bounce harder against the cocked hammer with a greater impact. Enough to make a difference in the life of your trigger job. And in most competitive shooting events, the fully supported hold has not yet been taken when letting the slide go forward. So there you have it. And in the third place, the issue of the hammer ever falling to half cock is another story, having more to do with trigger weight. The lighter the trigger you have, the more competent the gunsmith you’ll need to ensure the trigger job is up to that. And also in response to Clay’s post, you’re probably right about this being overkill nowadays, with modern metallurgy. Our armorers worked with milspec parts, which were only surface hardened. Once a milspec hammer or sear is worked on and improved, some of that surface hardness is taken away, and so that trigger might eventually need a re-work after a few thousand rounds. There are many excellent aftermarket triggers available nowadays, EDM machined to exacting tolerances, then hardened through and through. These ones, if your satisfied with them, will probably never need this technique to preserve them. Good point to make. Okay, that’s all I can contribute here, hope its enough.]]></comment_content>

Even the new ones were being made on machinery that was state of the art in 1917. The 1911 means that that good old venerable pistol first saw light of day 103 years ago. You're showing your age.

        <![CDATA[Many years ago a trigger job would include a procedure where two thirds of the hammer notch would be filed away leaving only the center one third of the hammer to catch the sear. Military armors used this technique when trigger  jobs were first being developed for bulls eye shooting. The sear engagement 'fit' was easier to accomplish. The downside of this was chipping off the notch when letting the slide go full energy on the notch. Thus the old school method of thumb on the hammer and first finger on the slide release.
Holding pressure on the trigger holds the disconnect in position when the slide is released. The pistol will not fire with the disconnect engaged.]]>

      <comment_content><![CDATA[AMU Vet, I caught  the trigger  statement off the bat, but knew what you were saying and meaning. Being  the unit Marksmanship coordinator for an Combat Engineer Co., Taking troops to FT. Knox for the State Rifle teem, I did get to help some with the Berreta 92. and noticed one troop  operating the slide release with his 'off hand' which seemed odd at the time. He must have been traind to do so as now the slide is released with the hand holding the weapon, being operatable from either side.By the way, under combat situation, one need to use the  onehanded method as his off hand may be doing something else. as retriving another slid or even injured.

      <comment_content><![CDATA[As a L/Cpl in the Marines, I was taught the same technique while assigned to the 2d MAW MTU & member of the pistol team in 1988. The reason was to prevent to the hammer from following the slide upon loading, and to protect the sear.  An alternative technique was to squeeze & hold the trigger when releasing the slide.   Now as a MSgt in the Air National Guard, and the NCOIC of my base pistol team, I teach my bullseye shooters to hold the hammer back with our team guns ~  which where were hand-built by the AF Gunsmith shop 20-30 years ago.

      <![CDATA[Residents were at home watching a movie around 11:20 p.m. when several men forced their way into the home through the front door. One of the residents opened fire on the intruders causing them to flee. One suspect was killed at the scene and another was later found with fatal gunshot wounds in the parking lot of a nearby animal hospital. Police reported that it appeared the suspect's body was dumped there as the others fled from the home-invasion-gone-bad. None of the residents were harmed during the ordeal. (<a href="http://jacksonville.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Florida Times-Union</em></a>, Jacksonville, FL, 6/20/13)



A 14-year-old boy was home alone in Pueblo, Colo., when three intruders broke in through the back door. According to reports, the boy heard someone enter and armed himself, and was faced with three intruders whom he opened fire on. He told police he believes he hit one of the intruders, who immediately fled. It was said that the home's power had been cut before the backdoor had been kicked in. Police are still searching for the suspects and keeping an eye on local hospitals for any gunshot wound victims.
