        <![CDATA[Gun: Winchester Model 12 "Trench" Gun Condition: 80 percent overall (NRA Modern: Very Good) Approximate Value: $1,600 (add $225 for bayonet/scabbard)
How many of you would trade an original, similar condition Winchester 28-ga. Model 12 with factory Cutts compensator "even up" for this World War II Model 12 trench gun? It may surprise you that the trench gun is now worth more money.
Until the mid-1990s, U.S. military long arms, including shotguns, had not been as popular or collectible as U.S. military handguns. Then things changed in a hurry, but what made the difference? A surge of popular public awareness in World War II history, including various 50th anniversaries and the movie "Saving Private Ryan," became the main catalysts for renewed collector interest in military long arms. The U.S. military shotguns finally reached a comparable level of acceptance that military handguns and most rifles and carbines had enjoyed for decades.
This unaltered, blued specimen has a correct 20 7/8" round barrel with ventilated shroud, and its serial number (1014064) indicates that it was manufactured during 1943. A Remington "1917" marked bayonet, which may have been an original World War II issue for this Winchester shotgun, with scabbard also adds value.  
Approximately 80,000 Model 12 trench guns were manufactured between 1941 and 1944, and later production featured a Parkerized metal finish. Careful inspection will reveal four rows of holes in the handguard for barrel heat venting, changed from six during 1917.
Originality is Polar North for U.S. military long-gun collectors, which means it is essential to know exactly which proofmarks should be present and where they are located. Note the "U.S." and the ordnance flaming bomb proofs on the right side of the receiver and crisp stock cartouche with inspector’s initials, in addition to the sling swivels. When evaluating U.S. military shotguns, carefully examine the originality of the hardware and choke marking on the barrel (beware of cut barrels), look for possible new or restamped proofmarks and cartouche, and check for metal or wood refinishing that might indicate a non-original finish.

        <![CDATA[<em>Q. What do I have? The gun’s overall length is 5 3/4". Its octagonal barrel is 15/8" long. It appears to be a five-shot center-fire revolver with hard black plastic grips. My guess is that it is European. Overall quality is rather crude. I think it was very inexpensive when it was sold. 
I have been to more than 50 gun shows, but I have never seen another one like it.</em>

A. Your revolver is one of many European, usually un-named, models made by often unidentifiable manufacturers that tend to feature a hammerless configuration (actually a concealed hammer), a folding trigger, and a manual safety. They are sometimes generally referred to as "Velodog" revolvers, reflecting one intended use-protecting early bicyclists (velocipedists) from dogs enraged by the new-fangled contraptions.

Technically, the "Velodog" title might be properly reserved for those chambered for the long, slender, 5.5 mm center-fire Velodog cartridge, but most collectors use the term to refer to all of the general type regardless of caliber. 
Most were manufactured in Europe during the late 19th century until the start of World War II, primarily in Belgium, but also in wwGermany and other countries. Many different examples can be found, and sometimes it seems harder to find two alike than a new variation.

Yours is one of the few that may be identifiable as to origin. The warrior head logo on your grips suggests that it was made by the German firm of Arminius, which manufactured handguns beginning about 1922. One source I have indicates the .320 Revolver caliber version is called the Model 8, with .32 ACP caliber versions made as the Model 9 and Model 10.

      <title>Winchester 1873 Lever-Actions</title>
      <link>http://www.americanrifleman.org/?p=31691</link>

        <![CDATA[<em>Q. Can you tell me about the Winchester 1873 lever-action rifle? In particular, I would like to know when Winchester stopped making it. Are replicas available?</em>

A. Winchester’s Model 1873 was an instant success when it was introduced. The 1873 was an improvement over the first famous Winchester lever-action-the brass-framed Model 1866 "Yellowboy." The 1873 was offered only with an iron frame and was initially chambered in the powerful, then-new .44 Winchester Center Fire (WCF), also called the .44-40 Win.

Winchester manufactured the Model 1873 from 1873 through 1919, producing about 720,000 in all. Model 1873s were initially chambered in .44-40 Win., then the .32 WCF rifles were added later. Although very rare today, about 19,000 1873s were chambered in .22 rimfire.

Most of the standard-production 1873s were supplied in a blue finish. On these, the lever, hammer, fore-end cap and buttplate were color-casehardened. Some early guns, as well as a few made on special order, were supplied with color-casehardened receivers, while the barrel and magazine tube were blued or browned. The Model 1873 was offered as a carbine with a light-weight 20" round barrel or a musket with a 30" barrel, but the most popular version was a 24"-barreled rifle in both octagonal- and round-barrel configurations. Special-order barrel lengths were also available, as were a large variety of other options, such as special sights, fancy wood, half-octagon/half-round barrels and checkering.

Replica 1873s are produced today by A. Uberti in Italy. They have become very popular with Cowboy Action shooters and are imported into the United States by firms such as Cimarron Firearms, Navy Arms, EMF, Taylor’s and Co., and Stoeger, to name but a few.

      <content_encoded><![CDATA[One can meet all sorts of interesting characters at the NRA Annual Meetings, and today I met one who's really special, Elizabeth Ann Staehler from Spring, Texas. You could even say Elizabeth Ann is the most "precious" of all the 70,000+ NRA members expected to flock to the weekend sessions in Indianapolis, since earlier she was recognized as the youngest Life member present. It has been long-standing tradition during the Annual Meeting of Members to identify both the oldest and youngest Life members in attendance, and at just two months, the young lady from Texas, earned recognition.  When I met Elizabeth Ann -along with proud parents Tanya and Matt, she was taking in the action at the Aimpoint shooting simulator in the Exhibit Hall, where eager shooters were taking turns tracking and "shooting" wild boars charging through varied Nordic-looking landscapes. Elizabeth Ann alternated between being a bit fussy (no doubt anxious for her chance to join the fun a few years hence) and happy, especially when someone was making great shots on those elusive pigs.  Given her early start in NRA and her supportive shooting family, I bet Elizabeth Ann grows up to be a crack shot.]]></content_encoded>
